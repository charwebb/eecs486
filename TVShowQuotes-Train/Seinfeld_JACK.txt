(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?
Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?
Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).
Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
Listen do you think I give a damn?
(dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
(dancing around) Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!
Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
(pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.
Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?
I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.
Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.
Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)
It's 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)
This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.
Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.
W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.
Get the hell outta here with your knob.
There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
So when are you coming down to Florida again?
(a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag.
Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.
(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.
So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?
