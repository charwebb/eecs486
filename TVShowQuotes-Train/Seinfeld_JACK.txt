Take the pen.
Alright how the hell do I know?
No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).
(dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
Who's car?
Your son?
So when are you coming down to Florida again?
Go ahead.
His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.
This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.
Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.
Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)
But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)
Come on, take the pen!
Come on!
This happens to be my pen.
What's in the boxes?
Hey. Hi Cosmo.
Listen do you think I give a damn?
(to Jerry) What happened to you?
(disbelief) You bought it?
Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.
Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?
Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.
You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.
What for?
Positive! Take the pen!
So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?
I don't wanna take a ride.
The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
No, thank you.
(pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
Oh it was a gift.
Ya
Yours?
Do me a personal favor!
C'mon Morty, the jig is up!
Take the pen!
What boxes?
There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
What took you so long?
Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.
What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
Still works.
No. thanks, no.
I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.
Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
I gotta fix your window now?
That's what you think.
(dismissive) Yaah!
I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
Take the pen!
(half to himself) I'll bet you don't.
I'm not sitting down!
So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
Yeah.
(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.
Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
Some car.
This pen?
Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
Thank you.
Who died?
It's 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)
Need a pen?
I don't want it!
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.
When do you want these?
So uh where's your father?
He what?
Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.
What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?
All right! (he smiles and take it)
I thought you're going to Paris
(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.
I did not.
(a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag.
Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
(pointing) Hello, Jerry.
Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
This thing is a, is a behemoth.
Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
I'm gonna be in the can.
Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
It's Jack Klompus.
(dancing around) Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!
Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?
What's there to see underwater?
Get the hell outta here with your knob.
Danny's? (scoffs) C'mon!
Stop it!
(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
You what?
Whose pen?
Well I mean...
Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
I'm kidding.
So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
