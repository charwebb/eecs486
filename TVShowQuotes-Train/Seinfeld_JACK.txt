See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.
So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?
Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
(dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.
(a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag.
(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.
It's 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)
Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.
What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?
So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?
Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.
There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
Get the hell outta here with your knob.
This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).
(pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.
I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.
Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.
(dancing around) Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!
Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.
So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
So when are you coming down to Florida again?
(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)
I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
Listen do you think I give a damn?
