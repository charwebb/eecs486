(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.
(a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag.
(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.
So when are you coming down to Florida again?
Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
It's 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)
Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.
Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
(dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)
(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
(pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.
I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.
There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
Get the hell outta here with your knob.
But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)
I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.
(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?
The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
(dancing around) Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!
Listen do you think I give a damn?
Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.
So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?
Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.
Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.
This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?
