(dancing around) Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!
Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
Get the hell outta here with your knob.
(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.
Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
So when are you coming down to Florida again?
Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.
So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?
See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.
His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.
But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)
Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.
What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?
Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.
Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
(a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag.
I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?
Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)
No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).
(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.
(dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
(pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
Listen do you think I give a damn?
Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.
It's 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)
So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.
(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.
