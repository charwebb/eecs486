You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)
So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?
What boxes?
Who died?
He gave it to me!
Well I mean...
I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
Take the pen.
Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.
I did NOT have a coke.
C'mon Morty, the jig is up!
Yours?
Come on!
I thought you're going to Paris
You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
He what?
It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.
Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.
Take the pen!
(disbelief) You bought it?
So when are you coming down to Florida again?
Do me a personal favor!
W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.
All right! (he smiles and take it)
(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
Thank you.
Whose pen?
Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.
Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
Get the hell outta here with your knob.
When do you want these?
So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?
So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
What for?
(dismissive) Yaah!
No, thank you.
Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?
Oh it was a gift.
I'm not sitting down!
This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
(pointing) Hello, Jerry.
Still works.
(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.
Some car.
You're not me.
(dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
Danny's? (scoffs) C'mon!
What's there to see underwater?
There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
You what?
Hey. Hi Cosmo.
Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.
Positive! Take the pen!
Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
That's what you think.
His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.
The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
So uh where's your father?
Come on, take the pen!
I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
Go ahead.
Need a pen?
Hello Jerry,
You are uh, thinking of staying here?
So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
Your son?
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).
It's 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)
Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
(pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
Stop it!
This happens to be my pen.
Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.
(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.
(to Jerry) What happened to you?
You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
This thing is a, is a behemoth.
(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
Alright how the hell do I know?
I'm kidding.
What's in the boxes?
Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?
Who's car?
I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.
Listen do you think I give a damn?
What took you so long?
(dancing around) Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!
Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
I gotta fix your window now?
Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.
Yeah.
Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.
No. thanks, no.
Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
(a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag.
Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
I did not.
