Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?
This happens to be my pen.
I thought you're going to Paris
Thank you.
Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
You're not me.
You are uh, thinking of staying here?
Alright how the hell do I know?
I did not.
Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.
So when are you coming down to Florida again?
Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
(to Jerry) What happened to you?
He what?
Go ahead.
That's what you think.
You what?
(disbelief) You bought it?
What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?
Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
I don't want it!
C'mon Morty, the jig is up!
Listen do you think I give a damn?
Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
Hey. Hi Cosmo.
Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)
Hello Jerry,
(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.
Some car.
I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
Come on, take the pen!
I don't wanna take a ride.
No. thanks, no.
What took you so long?
Oh it was a gift.
Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.
Who's car?
Get the hell outta here with your knob.
So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
I did NOT have a coke.
You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
It's 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)
Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.
I'm kidding.
Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?
Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.
There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
All right! (he smiles and take it)
Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
Yes, we will.
You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
He gave it to me!
No, thank you.
Well I mean...
So uh where's your father?
(dismissive) Yaah!
I'm not sitting down!
Stop it!
This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
(half to himself) I'll bet you don't.
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
Your son?
It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.
Do me a personal favor!
(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
What's in the boxes?
(dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
(pointing) Hello, Jerry.
I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.
Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
It's Jack Klompus.
I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
Whose pen?
Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.
Danny's? (scoffs) C'mon!
Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
Take the pen!
(pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
Who died?
Positive! Take the pen!
I'm gonna be in the can.
What's there to see underwater?
Come on!
Yours?
Ya
Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.
Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
I gotta fix your window now?
His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.
(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.
Take the pen!
(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
This pen?
Yeah.
No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).
The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
Still works.
Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
What for?
(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
