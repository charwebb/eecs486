(Opens the door to reveal a ruffed up George) George?!
Well actually, it had a lot to do with George's comment.
The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper.
Oh, uh, George, (Introducing to two) this is my husband, David.
He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?
Hi, i've been doing a lot of thinking today and i don't know maybe i made a huge mistake
Ya he says he wants to say hello.
Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me.
Well it wasn't just that, i realized after 3 years of marriage that David's little quirks were getting on my nerves a little.
(talk to Jerry) Sure. (starts to hand George the phone) George it's Jerry.
Oh, well you know it's funny George. Sometimes you don't know how you're really feeling about something until a person like you comes along and articulates it so perfectly.
So we're just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent.
Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?
(Laughing) Well where ever you are i appreciate it.
(Unsure as to whether it's him or not) Jerry? Elaine, Hi!
Like in the middle of our fight last night he did this thing that he always does where he asks questions to himself, aloud. And then answers them.
(gets up to answer the phone) I don't know about that. Hold on (Picks phone up) Hello...Hi (pauses for Jerry to speak) ya last night I had a good time too (pauses for Jerry to speak) Really? that's so funny he's here right now.
