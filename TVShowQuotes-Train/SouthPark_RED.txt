Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit?

Paris is gonna rock his world.

Good for you, Stan. 

You made us look like uncaring idiots!

Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?

Hey emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school. 

Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I-

Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size.

Do me next. I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute.

Red!

Kelly who?

Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls, talkin' about bringin' down American government and all? 

Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!

God, they're annoying!

Shut off the light.

I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it. 

Three.

What the hell is that?!

She's totally spoiled and snobby.

Look, Wendy, we are all very happy for Lisa, okay? Nobody here is jelly. But the boys aren't even noticing the rest of us anymore.

It's not just Paris: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're all stupid spoiled whores!

So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us.

The Jeffersons?

Now blue!

You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.

Yeah, and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore.

What happened?

Who's Butters?

About Token? Why?

Butters? Your grandma's looking for you.

Did you invite him?

Good for you, Stan. It's nice somebody in this school has some balls.

Kelly Rutherfordmenskin?

Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!

Leave him alone, Wendy! He's mine! 

Yeah, Lisa has a crush on Butters.

Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes!

Not a cheat if you rank up.

Yeah? Who invited you?

Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist.

Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about? 

How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!

She said to meet her outside behind the school.

Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love. 

I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody.

Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls.

Aw dangit!

Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!

Oh God, that show is so dumb.

Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party.

Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?

Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.

Wendy, just go with it!

That boy Token.

Yeah, they're invited too.

Yeah. I can tell your future, Marjorine! You're going to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy, dorky geek.

Where do you buy your clothes?

Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--

Yeah, you said it. 

"Who's Paris Hilton?"

Well?

Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now.

Red!

...Wendy?

I wanna do him.

Red!

Yes.

Hey Marjorine, you wanna know your future?

Slut.

That's right!
