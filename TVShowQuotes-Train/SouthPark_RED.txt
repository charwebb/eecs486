Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size.
How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!
Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!
Yeah. I can tell your future, Marjorine! You're going to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy, dorky geek.
I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody.
You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants.
So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us.
Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love. 
Do me next. I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute.
Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!
Hey emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school. 
I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it. 
Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes!
Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?
She said to meet her outside behind the school.
Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--
Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist.
Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now.
Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party.
You don't want to go to this party, Wendy! We're inviting all the boys, and we're gonna play Spin the Bottle, and Two Minutes In The Closet, and do ketamine.
Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I-
Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.
Good for you, Stan. It's nice somebody in this school has some balls.
Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about? 
It's not just Paris: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're all stupid spoiled whores!
You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.
Look, Wendy, we are all very happy for Lisa, okay? Nobody here is jelly. But the boys aren't even noticing the rest of us anymore.
Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls, talkin' about bringin' down American government and all? 
Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea.
