Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? 

I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all.

Yeah. 

All right!

No phones, either? How do you communicate?

I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. 

Thanks, gaywad. 

Rebecca, what the devil are you doing? 

"Conscientious." May I have the definition, please?

I know, but this will all be over soon.

Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!

You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!

But I want to go back tomorrow, papá.

Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.

Give him the book back.

"Conscientious." Could you use it in a sentence, please?

Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!

Right.

Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. 

I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!

The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now.  They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.

All right! Go Dave!

I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.

Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.

Only the most important person in the world.

Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore.

All right! Let's play! 

Hooray!

The mayor! Good! Finally!

You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! 

Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  Look, here's the book they've been talking about-  it makes no sense.

I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.

Wow, what a great house!

But... they're... children!

Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some.

Let's go.  Our faces are painted. 

Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??

Oh, really?!

I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. 

Strange, friends would call each other names and fight.

That's a great story, Sarah.

Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. 

"Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S.

Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? 

Hn they want us back. 

...I'm not through with you, bitch! 

Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"

Hey, guys. What's up?

You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! 

Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?

Can I sit here with you?

Well, they duct-taped me to a bench.

No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life.

I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!

See ya, papá! 

Because I'm home-schooled.

I'm a lion. 

Why can't I go to school with the other boys?

Get off me! 

It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.

I'll do anything to get to a phone!

My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.

Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?

Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up! 

But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá.

Who?

Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. 

Well, what are you kids gonna do now?

Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  Ow.  Ow. 

No, it just really, really, really hurts!

What the hell is gong on here?!

She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.

Oh, dear.

You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?

The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.

...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out.

Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days.

We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.

Alright. 

Why are you doing this?

Hi!

Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again? 

Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting.

Please, just give me one more day. 

Calm down, papá!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. 

No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.

Don't be scared. They're just kids.  Where are your parents?!

Alright, I got the book for you. 

Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!

Who is that?

Now, can I please have the cell phone?

It's a boy.  They... killed him.

No, uh, it's lemon juice.

Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!

Papa?

Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?

Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! 

If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. 

Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.

Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me.

You're out of control.  You did this to my sister!
