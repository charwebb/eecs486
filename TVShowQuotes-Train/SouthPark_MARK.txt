You're out of control.  You did this to my sister!
Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!
You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. 
It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
Strange, friends would call each other names and fight.
No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.
Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me.
I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.
Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days.
...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out.
Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
"Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S.
Calm down, papá!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. 
You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! 
Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!
Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!
Well, what are you kids gonna do now?
I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. 
But I want to go back tomorrow, papá.
Don't be scared. They're just kids.  Where are your parents?!
No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life.
Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.
Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? 
Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  Look, here's the book they've been talking about-  it makes no sense.
My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
Now, can I please have the cell phone?
Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. 
Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again? 
No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.
Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some.
I know, but this will all be over soon.
Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? 
Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! 
Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"
I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. 
You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  Car one to base--  Aghh! 
Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?
Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?
Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.
"Conscientious." Could you use it in a sentence, please?
But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá.
The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now.  They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.
I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!
I'll do anything to get to a phone!
You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! 
She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
