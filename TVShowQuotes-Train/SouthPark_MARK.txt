But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá.
Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?
The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.
It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
"Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S.
Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?
No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! 
Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some.
I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all.
No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.
I'll do anything to get to a phone!
Don't be scared. They're just kids.  Where are your parents?!
The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now.  They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.
"Conscientious." Could you use it in a sentence, please?
Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? 
Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!
I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. 
Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. 
Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.
Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
Calm down, papá!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. 
Now, can I please have the cell phone?
Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!
Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!
Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!
I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
Well, what are you kids gonna do now?
Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"
Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days.
...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out.
My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life.
I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.
Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again? 
Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  Car one to base--  Aghh! 
Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
Only the most important person in the world.
Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore.
If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. 
But I want to go back tomorrow, papá.
Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.
She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
I know, but this will all be over soon.
You're out of control.  You did this to my sister!
Strange, friends would call each other names and fight.
I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. 
You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! 
I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.
Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. 
Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs?
