Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!

Oh, really?!

"Conscientious." Could you use it in a sentence, please?

Who?

Woohoo! OOWW!

But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá.

All right! Let's play! 

Please, just give me one more day. 

Now, can I please have the cell phone?

She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.

Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"

Let's go.  Our faces are painted. 

Hi!

Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.

That's a great story, Sarah.

I'm a lion. 

Oh no! 

Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  Look, here's the book they've been talking about-  it makes no sense.

Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?

Why are you doing this?

All right!

Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! 

...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out.

The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now.  They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.

It's a boy.  They... killed him.

No phones, either? How do you communicate?

Hn they want us back. 

Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.

Hooray!

The mayor! Good! Finally!

Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?

Don't be scared. They're just kids.  Where are your parents?!

No, it just really, really, really hurts!

Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? 

Why can't I go to school with the other boys?

Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting.

No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life.

Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some.

Can I sit here with you?

No, uh, it's lemon juice.

Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.

I know, but this will all be over soon.

It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.

Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up! 

Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. 

Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.

Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore.

Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again? 

Because I'm home-schooled.

The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.

See ya, papá! 

If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. 

Yeah. 

I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. 

What the hell is gong on here?!

I'll do anything to get to a phone!

Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??

"Conscientious." May I have the definition, please?

Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me.

I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!

I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. 

I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.

Alright, I got the book for you. 

Rebecca, what the devil are you doing? 

Dude, this is gay!

Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?

...I'm not through with you, bitch! 

You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! 

You're out of control.  You did this to my sister!

You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?

You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!

I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all.

My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.

No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.

Who is that?

I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.

Huh?

Right.

Thanks, gaywad. 

Hey, guys. What's up?

Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!

All right! Go Dave!

But I want to go back tomorrow, papá.

Give him the book back.

Well, they duct-taped me to a bench.

I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!

Strange, friends would call each other names and fight.

Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?

Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. 

Oh, dear.

Alright. 

Well, what are you kids gonna do now?

Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!

Calm down, papá!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. 

"Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S.

Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days.

We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.

Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!

Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. 

You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! 

What?
