She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all.
Well, what are you kids gonna do now?
No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life.
You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! 
Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?
No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.
I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.
The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now.  They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.
Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.
Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  Look, here's the book they've been talking about-  it makes no sense.
Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. 
Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. 
Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
I'll do anything to get to a phone!
No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
You're out of control.  You did this to my sister!
I know, but this will all be over soon.
But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá.
Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?
I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. 
Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!
Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? 
You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days.
Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!
You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? 
I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. 
Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
But I want to go back tomorrow, papá.
Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me.
Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
Only the most important person in the world.
Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! 
I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. 
I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.
Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.
Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore.
Don't be scared. They're just kids.  Where are your parents?!
Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!
Calm down, papá!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. 
You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! 
Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  Car one to base--  Aghh! 
"Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S.
Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!
Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some.
Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again?
