All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses.
I don't believe I've heard of the anti-Semitic sect of Judaism before.
Elehem hav dorim, ashoseveh laoleinu. Hakadosh boruku, omasheh hachreit. (Tonight, for the meteor shower, we will pray to Moses. Then we will give Moses thanks.)
Baleilah hazein, Hame kadesh mekoh hikenazu puanazikeh hakeilah. (Now gather us, the elders, on this most holy of nights.)
Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!
We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!
Alright, Jew Scouts, the meteor shower will start soon. Let's pray to Moses for guidance.  Moses, great leader, on this blessed night of Jewbilee, we ask for your tutelage.
I want to welcome you all. Though we each come from a different sect of Judaism, on this night of Jewbilee, we all pray to Moses as one. Hineinih kureh leirukeshu. (May all the power of Moses show the way...) Now, let us all introduce ourselves.
Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased. 
Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?! 
If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed.
If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear.
You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away!  All you need is some popcorn, and a needle and thread. 
Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming.
Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children?
You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake.
A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with!
Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people?
