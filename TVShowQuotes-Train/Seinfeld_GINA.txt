Hi.
It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
You dont want to?
I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
How are you?
Tell me about them. Everything.
I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
I wasnt.
I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
We dont have enough time.
Come, you walk me to a cab.
Who are these Stooges you speak of?
There is no time.
No, go ahead.
All right. Go ahead.
You will show me The Stooges?
Then kiss me right in front of him.
The junior?
He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
Tell me everything.
Yes, right here.
Then kiss me.
Come on.
Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
Martines girl friend.
A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?
Will you just get it.
No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
Its Gina.
You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
When?
Are you afraid of him?
I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
Forget it. Come on.
