Then kiss me.
The junior?
He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
Come on.
There is no time.
You next door neighbour.
You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
Tell me everything.
No, go ahead.
When?
He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drakes Coffee Cake.
Yes, right here.
We dont have enough time.
I wasnt.
Who are these Stooges you speak of?
You will show me The Stooges?
Forget it. Come on.
You dont want to?
I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
How are you?
I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
Come, you walk me to a cab.
Will you just get it.
Are you afraid of him?
Martines girl friend.
Tell me about them. Everything.
Its Gina.
I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
Then kiss me right in front of him.
Youre still afraid. You are not a man.
