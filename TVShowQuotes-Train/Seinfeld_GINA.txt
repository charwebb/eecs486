Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
Youre still afraid. You are not a man.
He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
Then kiss me right in front of him.
A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?
He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drakes Coffee Cake.
