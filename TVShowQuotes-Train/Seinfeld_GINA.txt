We dont have enough time.
Who are these Stooges you speak of?
You next door neighbour.
Tell me about them. Everything.
All right. Go ahead.
How are you?
I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
When?
I wasnt.
There is no time.
Tell me everything.
Then kiss me right in front of him.
No, go ahead.
It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
Come, you walk me to a cab.
Youre still afraid. You are not a man.
Come on.
Hi.
Forget it. Come on.
Are you afraid of him?
The junior?
I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drakes Coffee Cake.
Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
You will show me The Stooges?
You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
Yes, right here.
You dont want to?
Then kiss me.
Its Gina.
Will you just get it.
Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
