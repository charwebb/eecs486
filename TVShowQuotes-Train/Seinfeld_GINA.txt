Tell me everything.
Yes, right here.
Will you just get it.
He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drakes Coffee Cake.
Martines girl friend.
There is no time.
I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
You next door neighbour.
Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
Hi.
No, go ahead.
I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
Forget it. Come on.
The junior?
Then kiss me right in front of him.
A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?
I wasnt.
Come on.
We dont have enough time.
It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
Its Gina.
You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
All right. Go ahead.
He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
How are you?
Are you afraid of him?
I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
Come, you walk me to a cab.
Youre still afraid. You are not a man.
You dont want to?
When?
Then kiss me.
I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
Who are these Stooges you speak of?
No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
Tell me about them. Everything.
