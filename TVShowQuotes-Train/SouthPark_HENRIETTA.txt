Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!
Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. 
I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.
Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.
What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. 
Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?
The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. 
Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!
I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die.
Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.
Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."
Oh.  Oh!  Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again!  Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys.
That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore. 
Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.
If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.
So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.
Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!
He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.
So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?
Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!  This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! 
But they can't dress like that. That's our style.
My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.
Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!
Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.
Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!  I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! 
There's no winning this for you.  Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.
You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.
Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth?  Join us!
That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?
It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.
Well, I think we all know what has to be done.
Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. 
I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!
You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!
Get out of our space, you little twerps!
You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.
