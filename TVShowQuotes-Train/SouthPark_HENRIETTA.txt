Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!
Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!
I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die.
Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!  I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! 
Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village In from us too.
Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.
Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!
Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. 
I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!
It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.
So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?
You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.
There's no winning this for you.  Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.
My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.
What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.
Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. 
If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.
Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.
Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!  This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! 
Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."
It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.
Well, I think we all know what has to be done.
He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.
I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.
That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?
You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!
What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. 
So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.
The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. 
Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?
That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore. 
I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!
Oh.  Oh!  Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again!  Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys.
You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.
Get out of our space, you little twerps!
But they can't dress like that. That's our style.
