The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. 

What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. 

He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.

But they can't dress like that. That's our style.

Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.

Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.

I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die.

Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.

What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.

That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?

Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth?  Join us!

Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!

I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!

Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.

Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. 

Get out of our space, you little twerps!

Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.

Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.

You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!

Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?

So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?

Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?

You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.

It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.

I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!

You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.

Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. 

Well, I think we all know what has to be done.

Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village In from us too.

Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!  This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! 

That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore. 

It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.

There's no winning this for you.  Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.

Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!

Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."

Oh.  Oh!  Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again!  Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys.

If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.

Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!  I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! 

So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.
