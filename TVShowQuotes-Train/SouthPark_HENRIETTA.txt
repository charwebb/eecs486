Conformist bitch.

Oh.  Oh!  Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again!  Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys.

What?!

The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. 

Leave us alone!

Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?

So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?

I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!

Shut up, Mom!

Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.

Well, I think we all know what has to be done.

There's no winning this for you.  Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.

You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.

Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!

What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.

You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!

Hey guys. 

God, she just never stops!

What?!

Go away Mom! Leave me alone!

Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?

Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.

I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!

If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.

He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.

Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.

Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.

Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!

That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore. 

Get away, douchebag.

Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!  I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! 

Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village In from us too.

Oh my Gawd.  This is so... em-barrassing.

Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.

I'm not going to any fucking camp!

I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die.

Are we really doing this again?!

But they can't dress like that. That's our style.

Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. 

It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.

It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.

Go away Mom, I hate you.

That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?

Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.

Get out of my room, TWERP!

Get out of our space, you little twerps!

I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.

For sure.

Do I care?

Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."

Shut up, Mom! Go away!

Noo...

Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth?  Join us!

Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!  This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! 

Whoa.

What's Betamax?

So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.

What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. 

Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!

Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!
