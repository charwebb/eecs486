You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.
Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!
I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.
I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die.
Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!  I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! 
It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.
Well, I think we all know what has to be done.
There's no winning this for you.  Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.
Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!
That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?
Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. 
It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.
Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.
What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.
Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!  This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! 
Get out of our space, you little twerps!
Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."
Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth?  Join us!
Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.
That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore. 
If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.
So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?
Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.
My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.
Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village In from us too.
Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. 
Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.
Oh.  Oh!  Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again!  Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys.
The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. 
Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.
But they can't dress like that. That's our style.
Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. 
Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!
Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.
You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!
