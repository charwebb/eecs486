Folks, I apologize for this whole mess. I'm going to surrender. Somebody show the police a white flag.
Wow, man. That's beautiful. He was evil, but now he's good. 
"And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season." What do you think, guys?
I can't wait to get out among the pigs  and raise some hell.
Happy Kwanzaa, too
From me to you
Happy Holidays, you guys.
Folks need to understand that I am terror! I am fear! I am-! Oh, hey look, another holiday special.
If they don't care about you, would they have driven nine hours to Nebraska?
Oh my God, they killed the little orange-coat kid!
When I stand up on the mountain and say, "Do it!", it gets done! And it it don't get done, then I'll move on it! And that's the last thing in the world you want me to do.
How would you like to come with me to a more secluded part of the mall?
No, Howard. You go ahead. I've got something to say. 
Hey, man, don't point a gun at your own mother!
I'm glad I'm not you right now, kid.
You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about!
Come on, I'll buy you kids an orange Smoothie.
I can never make it up to the families that I destroyed, but at least I'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime  is an answer.
Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up in somebody's basement! I want some action!
You know what the spirit of Christmas is? It's another lie, from the lyin' pigs that consider me the witness-!
But Stan, your mother and father are out there!
Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy Holidays.
Uh, I went to a beauty parlor and had my tattoo redone.  Look!
You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did.
All right, boys, keep your heads down!  We're goin' to the mall!
