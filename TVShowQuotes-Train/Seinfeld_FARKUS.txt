(thoughtful) I've always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I uh, I hope you don't think uh, this is out of line, but would it be okay with you, if I were to ask her out?
And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I know, when I'm wearing Banlon, there appears to be some jiggling.
You know, selling bras exclusively to women, we're really only utilising fifty percent of the market.
Have you ever sold a woman's line before?
So, basically George the job here is quite simple. Selling bras.
(to George) Get out! (to Ms. De Granmont) I'm terribly sorry Ms. De Granmont...
Uh, this is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman. (George's offers his hand to shake) He's supposed to start on monday.
(sympathy) Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating.
Well, I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont...
Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea.
...But, barring any unforeseen developments, gentlemen, I think we're sitting on a winner.
(indicating the bro) So uh, what d'you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro? What?
Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, that you will have a very bright future here at E.D. Granmont.
