(to Jay about Russell) What's with him? (to Russell) Russell? (louder) Russell?
(to Jay) Boy, talk about a show about nothing. (Jay, the integral producer, smiles stupidly)
Oh, hi. (calling to someone) Bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.
Well, I think we should get started anyway.
To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared.
In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show.
I'm calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network.
I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. Its great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway, shes a very luck woman. Enjoy the race.
He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.
Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.
