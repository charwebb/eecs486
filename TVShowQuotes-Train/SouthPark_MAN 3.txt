I'm on TV! I'm on TV!

It'll be like a parade!

Yeah, you you get him, Oprah!

You did.

Oooooooooh!

We don't "hate" homosexuals, we, we we just don't want them to be able to marry.

What's ridiculous about it?

They're ridiculing that singer! Come on, let's get outta here! 

We need your expertise, sir.

Hi. 

You won't take us alive! 

Wha- what did you- what did he say?

They took your jobs! 

Let's go, huh.

Whoa, it smells, it smells! 

Jennifer, over here.

Gaaah!

What an amazing human being! 

Ooo.

We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand...  this.  Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us.

We need to find somethin' to paddle with.

He's so gay.

I hope it doesn't happen to me.

Poor woman. She's a victim.

I could do Tuesday.

Yes. The mu-se-um.

That sounds good.

Mm hmm.

I don't know why we were watchin' that garbage in the first place. 

Yup.

Sorry?

Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought- 

No, we won't.

Oh, that's courageous.

You can't make fun of Scientology, kid! We are gonna sue your ass AND your balls!

Yeah. 

Oohh, I gotta go.

Ms. Claridge, you all right?  You can talk to me, Ms. Claridge. I understand: one beep for yes and two for no. Don't you think you should get out of the street?  Look you, you don't have to be so cold. I'm just trying to help.  Oooo, sorry! 

Boy, that's one creeepy alien.

My name is Harry and I'm an alcoholic.

You guys are terrible! How could you laugh at that poor kid?!

Thank you for returning!

Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?

Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!

Yes I would like a blowjob 

Yeah.

Oh, what a great idea! We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!

Canada, on strike.

What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?

Yes tell us.

I've gotta go.

I am.

Shit if I know.

Hey look, Betty. It's that "nigger" guy.
