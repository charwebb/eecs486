It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! 

All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.

Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!

Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing.  Yes.

Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in.  This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?

Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.

You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith? 

Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this.

Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test.

Come on out, kid. 

Aw crap.

Mike? Mike??

Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.

But then that means...

A what?!

We drink and take drugs.

What do we do? Can we disable the timer?

They'll find the detonator, Hildog.

Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun!  All right now, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Just answer these questions as truthfully as you can, alright?  Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret?

There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... 

Good times, good times!

I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.

Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef.  But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!

Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it.  Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you?

We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters!

My God, they hid it under the stage?!

Come on, honey. 

Mike, I need to talk to you!

The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D

Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion.

Hey there! How are you?

Hey Kelly. How's it going?

You're carrying a stolen whale!

No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!

There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!

It's dark... cold...

Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time.  All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!!

You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.

It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.

This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?

We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. 

Ready to go, sir.

Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! 

Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable and totally depressed.

Well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for Scientology. I think it can really make you happy again.

Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid.

Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them?

I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.

What?!

Take a look at this.

Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!

All right, out of the truck!

Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat?
