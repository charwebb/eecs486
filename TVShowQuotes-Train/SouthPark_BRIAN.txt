Ready to go, sir.

You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.

Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!

You're carrying a stolen whale!

Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this.

Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid.

A what?!

Mike, I need to talk to you!

Well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for Scientology. I think it can really make you happy again.

Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in.  This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?

We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. 

We drink and take drugs.

Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion.

This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?

But then that means...

There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!

Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef.  But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!

Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter - this one's obviously broken. Sorry about this, Greg.

They'll find the detonator, Hildog.

Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them?

It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.

Come on, honey. 

I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.

You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith? 

My God, they hid it under the stage?!

Aw crap.

I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.

Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.

Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! 

It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.

What do we do? Can we disable the timer?

The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D

Take a look at this.

It's dark... cold...

Mike? Mike??

Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time.  All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!!

Hey there! How are you?

Come on out, kid. 

It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! 

Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!

Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat? 

Hey Kelly. How's it going?

Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test.

All right, out of the truck!

All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.

Oh! We are gonna sue you!

Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it.  Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you?

What?!

Yep- Oh hey there, Greg!

There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... 

Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable and totally depressed.

Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing.  Yes.

Good times, good times!
