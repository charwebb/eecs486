Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable and totally depressed.
There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... 
Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test.
It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! 
I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.
Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it.  Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you?
Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them?
My God, they hid it under the stage?!
Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in.  This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.
Oho, that's just this thing: What's the Denver Broncos' record now? Six and two?
This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time.  All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!!
Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter - this one's obviously broken. Sorry about this, Greg.
Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef.  But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!
There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!
Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!
We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters!
Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.
I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.
Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid.
Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun!  All right now, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Just answer these questions as truthfully as you can, alright?  Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret?
The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D
Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! 
It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.
It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.
What do we do? Can we disable the timer?
We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. 
Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!
Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion.
Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this.
