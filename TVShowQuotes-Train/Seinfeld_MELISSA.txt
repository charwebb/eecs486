Ohh, we've heard a lot about you! (Confidentially) It is so sweet of you to take her out.
(coughing loudly, while Jerry's expression turns to disgust) Wrong pipe.
(wheeling out Jerry's bicycle) OK, Jerry. I fixed that bike.
(finally opening the jar) Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna leave a welt. Look at that.
(crouching down next to the bike) I should really clean those bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk.
It's like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I, uh, made a faux pas.
(naked on the couch) What are you doing?
So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table)
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking that we could go down...
I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.
(appearing in the kitchen stark naked) Oh, fantastic! I'm starving.
