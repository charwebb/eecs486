You people say I led you, but it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us.  I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers.
Take it easy. Nice and easy.
I am not. Huh.
Elmo, god���s sake, it���s the Elmo era.
Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry.
And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.
How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?
I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.
I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately.
Tell my wife you're lying.
Ohh, unfortunately, yes.
[on the phone] Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade.
Your heart is broken. So is mine.
Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard.
Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.
Cookies. Cookie placement.
I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly]
We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
Absolutely.
Tambourine? You know I���m the CEO, right?
Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-
Skinned knee.
Now we get to the bottom of Nellie���s ���yes, yes, yes, yes, never.���
No games.
Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?
Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is 'impotence.'
I miss being in a band.
Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.
Oo, a little ice on that maybe.
Please. [laughs]
Yeah.
Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?
[laughing] Kevin!
Right.  I mean you���re an accountant.  Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.
You were dining alone? All those people are you?
Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.
Yeah.
Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.
Are you sure?
What are your thoughts.
[loudly knocking on the window] In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. [to Mrs. California] There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?
I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work.
Where can I get a drink? Oh...
Nellie?
Shopaholic.
and the hero, who's that based on?
Haha! There he is. You mind lending a hand? I'm typing up a memo to share your ideas with the board.
No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.
You should see the whole thing.
Cheers.
Hold one finger up to Susan. You���ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, ���are you taking your medicine?���
Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?
[laughing and clapping] Delightful.
No.
Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?
What are we talking about?
Midnight Rambler?
Yeah.
I���m never uncomfortable.
Here, use this one. [walking to Jim's desk]
Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom.
No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life.
Oh, that sounds nice.
You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have.
What is this?
Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess.
Good morning, Robert,' says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. [no one responds] Pam!
Nellie.
Probably shouldn���t have said that. [Jim���s jaw drops]
Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?
Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she���ll shine.
Mmm. Wow.
You can just put it down.
Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?
Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don���t you think? Well, I doodle too, but I���m not an artist. So I draw words and lists.
Oh, for god ���
No, that's absolutely the case.
[sees Jim's abandoned car] That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere.
Hello Jim. [Jim tries to escape]
Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. [Gabe laughs] Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly.
We'll talk. [walks away]
I'm sorry?
Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free.
Andy, why don't you just take a seat?
Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!
You like her.
Not destroyed. No..... Not destructive. Quite...off-kilter, sure. But... that's too vague. [long pause] Erratic. Darkly erratic. [laughs awkwardly] That's my mood.
A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day.
Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade.
I did not know about the sales figures.
Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones]
Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]
I never said that.
And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
��� is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
Ah.
Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby?
[on the computer screen] I���ll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.
Dwight.
I don���t- I don���t wanna say-
She likes you.
Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? [camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I���ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.
[Andy continuously knocking on door] Yes, for god���s sake Andy. Yes, come in.
Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it.
You made it.
Are you telling me that there���s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?
No, no.
Jiminey Christmas indeed.
Well what is the idea?
I just did.
Simply���end the mistakes
Thank you so much.
[chuckles] Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.
[telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start--
Are you scared of snakes?
I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn���t until my marriage to Angela that I realized how���charmless I find the female body.
I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place.
What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?
Now then, how are we today?
Double.
Let's wait, until we have something to smoke about.
Harry���
Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright?
The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts.
Wonderful.
[to the keyboardist, Curtis, and the drummer] Hey, you found us!
Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?
Pam, Pam, you���ve completely bungled this!
Good.
Ah, please. Here���s what it is. It���s a doodle.
Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-
[laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty?
Andy, that's very kind--
Oh.
[speaking at the same time as andy] This is atrocious.
Well you can't say no.
She, she is remarkable.
I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs]
Nah, it's good.
Par for the course. Par for the...freaking course. I'll be in the party room having a cookie until 11. Haha! Yule-log.
I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking. [gestures to Andy in Santa costume]
Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work?
I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy.
Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar.
[to dwight] Did you need something from us?
Well...
Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
Yep.
Andy, just answer the question.
Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?
Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I���ll just duck out and run the company for a while.
The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too.
I can expense it.
Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.
Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed?
Hi.
Oh, hi there.
Yeah, hello?
It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating.
What, as some sort of last hoorah?
The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.
Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will
Describe your day so far.
You alright?
If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?
[laughs] This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out.
Oh.
Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us.
Andy, Erin, you can join us now.
How do you mean?
Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?
Andy you should leave. Now.
Andy, do you know why I chose you?
Hey! [Kevin embraces Robert in a tight hug] Oh!
In the box.
Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?
No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-
Let���s do it now. What���s number one?
My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you.
[on phone] Say hello grandma.
I love my wife.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
No.
Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!
Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share? [Creed, Kevin and Meredith raise their hands]
All right. Thanks.
[to Dwight] Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?
Are we done?
Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny. [chuckles]
You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow.  Let's try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food.
That was bad.
And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It���s a waste of your time. That���s how every day���s begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.
Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it?
There we go.
Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe. [applause continues]
Where is everyone? Where is Andy?
Who is it?
I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.
Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.
David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.
I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn���t you agree.
Yes, hello, nice to meet you.
Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh?
I don't know. Maybe not. Just come.
Shalom. [sighs] Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. [grunt] I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month. [slaps the mat, they wrestle]
It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?
no, Nellie, she-
Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it���s birth.  Those superstores are terrified of us.  Anybody know why?
Is this a video conference you're having with 'Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz'?
Hello Andy.
Sit down, Dwight.
Sesame street.
Oh, no, you-
Jim what are you���What a surprise.
I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice....I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better.
Amongst them was a man, tall, slim.
Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why'd they add coconut? I miss original.
There���s someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.
I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.
I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing. [at the same time, Dwight says:  You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!]
Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I���m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
That is very cold.
[on the computer screen] I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest��� I am gay.
You feeling fulfilled in your life?
Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa. [tries to catch it with racket, misses, lands on floor]
No, no. I'm very comfortable with all things sexual. Continue.
Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is... a paper company.
It���s true.  They���ve been preserved for thousands of years.  They���re all over.
I don't think so.
Can everyone just, please��� I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and ��� how should I say this ��� Columbian whites. What ��� what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
It's a basil plant.
Have you considered the possibility that you slept with a drifter?
Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's basement: It's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right?
I am not.
Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time���
When two animals are having sex, one of them...
Why? Not only are you terrible at squash, but you don't even seem to enjoy it. Jim, this is not enough of a challenge for me.
Because it's too terrifying to imagine. Now we're cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours?
Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place.
Great. Thank you.
Eleven love. I win again.
It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse.
Not much we can do about this until he gets here.
The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies.
Andy. Let���s see if there���s a good fit first. Then we���ll talk.
They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they?
He just hung up on me mid-sentence.
Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. [Robert strips, jumps in pool, Gabe and Ryan join him]
Hello.
You���re blackmailing me.
[Erin opens door] Erin.
No, come on.
What...is happening to me? [pause] The lines in your haggard face are paths that lead nowhere. Your hair is the fire of hell. [hugs Meredith] I sincerely hope you find a sexual partner tonight.
This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.
Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer.
Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. 'Oh, wait,' she thought, 'I don't have a husband.' For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, 'Baby, are you okay?' Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, 'I'm fine, b!tch, I'm fine.'
Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this. [holds up large check for $2,000]
This whole accusation is insulting. Come on.
Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.
Pam, when���s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn���t hold the memories in?
A game or a match?
No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight. [leaves]
It's a command.
I'll see you next week Will. [at the club, playing squash]
There���s something about an underdog that really inspires���the unexceptional.
When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies: Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden [bleep] Pond.
Let me tell you how I buy something these days.  I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price.  Or I don���t know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me.  The era of personal service is back. You are back.  You���ll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them ���you are welcome.��� [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people.  Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen.  Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.
That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. [laughs]
The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with.
All life is sex. And all sex is competition.
[chuckles] I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response.
Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?
Don���t worry. I���ve scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on.
Oof. [laughs] Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. [laughs] I'm actually the CEO.
Oh my.  It was just actually cookies the whole time?
[laughing] Extraordinary. Did you plan this?
Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!
You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves.
[enters room, everyone quiets and separates] I���d like to invite the following people to join me for lunch: Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.
Yes, ���course. Why don���t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
This is preposterous.
Oh yes it can.
Who are they?
Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio.
Hmm.
Erin, what can I get for you?
Ha, I guess I think they���re losers.
Ah���
Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.
Great....ok.
Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.
So I think you know what we want to know.
No [laughs] my god.
People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-
Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I���ll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you���re a winner. If I didn���t, I don���t. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.
Excuse me?
[enters] Oh, still here. Terrific.
This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with?
Oo!
I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.
No, I'm certain you said basil.
[interrupting] I���m afraid you���ve lost my interest.
So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! [wakes her up] Excited!
Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he���s all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.
I���m not kidding.
End the mistakes. That is all I ask. [gets up from chair] And you can't have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all.
This room I liked for the view. I dreamed that I would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before. [laughs]
Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?
Fine.
Shh��� shh��� [vomits in trash can]
And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?
[claps Andy's shoulder] Heh.
I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.
Let's get Jim in here. [Jim shoves out of fram in his chair, Robert looks for Jim] Where's Jim?
Sounded like mine.
Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun.
My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?
Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright. [hangs up]
[to camera] What am I up to?
That sounds good.
Andrew. [Robert extends his hand.]
I would be eternally grateful. It���s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.
You lying son of a bitch!
Well that's a shame.
When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn't that be nice?
[censored beep] ha, Jesus.
What are we talking about?
Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here... is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office.
Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?
You don't want to hear the other one. You love marmalade.
You were going to talk at the end of the��� I���m not here.
Hello, Andy.  Excellent tie.
Okay. My serve.
Oh! Thank you. Uh���.
Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this.
Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.
I almost didn't come in today. [laughs]
And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it?
I should go.
Might as well have been sketching a cube.
[laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers.
Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.
The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.]
I'm just about to give the tour.
I'm selling the house, actually.
Thank you.
Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it.
Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us. How dare we let it into our decision making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships. It's funny, isn't it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.
Andrew sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all.
You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.
I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla.
Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis.
Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is.
[holds a medal to the light] This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal]
When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. [hisses] She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter.
