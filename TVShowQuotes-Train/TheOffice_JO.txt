[to Angela, who's having a hard time deciding on a chair] Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion!
All that's just birthday information, Michael.
Yeah.
Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you.
[walks in with her dogs] Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this. [gives the dog leashes and multiple bags to Gabe]
[cell phone rings] Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don't ride 'em. Lotta people try to ride 'em.
Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that!
Hmm.
[Jim's edited version of her book on tape]: Now listen here, Gabe, you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat. I made some changes to my book. See if you like them.
Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though. [picks up resume from Jim's desk] Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?
Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers.
Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
Sorry Sugar. What'd you want?
They love a good crotch.
He's in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi! [everyone in the audience is laughing]
Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.
Who else would be responsible?
You can go on. Shoo!
When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she'd ask one question: What do we do when we find the guilty party? And if they said, 'Come down on him with that swift hammer of justice!', innocent. A clear conscience don't need no mercy. But if they said 'Officer Bessie, well they may have had a reason, blah blah blah blah', well nine times out of ten, that's the anus they'd check.
Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
Okay hush now.
I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?
When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me.
Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.
Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.
I'll interview you right now.
Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something.
I would take until the end of the day if I were you. [Michael leaves conference room]
But you wouldn't need more trucks?
Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time.
You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work...
Can you now?
Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay.
No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set.
If it doesn't matter, then tell me.
Good-looking group.
Which are?
She didn't mention it?
I look forward to that too.
How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?
Yeah, but see... it's not.
Oh no no no!  Are you feeling ill?
We don't need any heroes here honey. It's time for you to get on home now.
Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.
Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?
Michael?
Well, I think you're both being a little too modest.
I've always been a fighter. And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard--
[gesturing to Michael] I thought this guy was the manager?
All right then.
That's f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob.
Let's just talk.
Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm's reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we're gonna take that arm, and we're gonna start selling printers.
Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can't have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week.
Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager.
Honey, you don't seem like your normal self.
Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!
Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.
Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs]
Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
No, send him in. [to Search Committee] Who is this?
Michael?
Hello?
[to Dwight] Hello.
This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim?
Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?
Each of you is doing half a job.
[Michael dressed as Jo Bennett, using a bad Southern accent] DeAngelo! We're in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain't got no host!
No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement.
Yes, well okay. Florida ain't that far away.
Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?
Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.
Well, I guess we're all right, Michael.
Well, I'm gonna let this marinate. So you can go.
Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket?
Except this. [hands stack of paper to Toby]
You should take that as a compliment!
[pulls out glass cube with coal.] Is that a lump of coal?
Yeah. I think I understand.
Who is it?
Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea?
Oh good morning sweetheart.
Michael.
They're the easiest-to-use printers on the market.
All right.
Enough!
Oh, that's Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the 'Mrs.' just to piss off the new wife. Well, let's take a gander around this place.
What?!
So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?
It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.
Thank you.
So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
Paper material?
And that's your unbiased opinion.
Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carrying nothing but my Sable gloves.  I've had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.
The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, 'You're Too Fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat.' The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. 'I love you, you Gay Bastard,' I said. 'You Gay Bastard,' I s--. 'Gay Ba--' 'Gay B--''
I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?
[Looks over his proposal] I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?
Really?
Michael Scott... what do you know?
Why is this my problem, Michael?
You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?
Anything I can do for you Puddin'?
Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won't fire the boy.
Hey!
I'm not sure you do, teddy bear.
Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? [Michael gesturing 'no'] I want to see who it is. Turn me around.
Michael.
Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted.
Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. [Scoffs] You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!
Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.
Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys.
Turn me around. Now. [Michael starts to leave, Jo whistles] Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said?
And we didn't find anything on your computer.
Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it.
Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling!
Luckily I have someone for you!
Oh honey, surely you don't want that.
Okay.
Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him?
Mama Jo knew there was something up.
I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager.
Have I been that naughty?
Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was.
Let me see what I can do.
You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I'm gonna defer to your judgment.
Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room?
I think that's it. So we're all good! [many employees raise their hands] Thanks ya'll.
Now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay bastard. Chapter One. I was born, not into luxary, nor poverty. [Gabe looks through Jo's book] But into adversity, and for that, I thank the Lord. My Father was a man. That's all we can know.  After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Stree and down Azalea Lane. Which would later become my--
[as Gabe hands out forms to everyone] It's a little form, says 'I did not do it.'
Hey there.
How'd my girl Nellie do?
Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?
I like that.
I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn't here in sixty seconds...
Huh?
Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited?
I think you [to Michael] will become the salesman, and congratulations! [to Jim] You're gonna be the new manager of this branch!
I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy.
I'm Jolene Bennett, Jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, and now I have my own pilot's license. I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you.
I am so proud of Sabre's 'Print In All Colors' initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. [Kelly applauds]  Daryl?
All that for this job.
Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. [Jo's phone starts vibrating, she picks it up and sees Dwight has texted her 'Dwight's ability as a manager has lead him to higher levels of proffesional success,'] Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!
Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat!
The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder.
Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money?
Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? Cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can't come in my house.
Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
Well, anytime now.
Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?
Yeah, I want to hear more from you.
Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho, what'cha say?
Okay Dwight.
Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson's snowball company, so you'll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things.
Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn't quite as racy, but uh... let's give it a go.
You know it doesn't have to be an invention.
Yes?
Oh, I hate that.
I hope your rough patch ends soon.
Well, I'm inclined to believe you.
You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management?
Who's Holly?
Yes it is.
Better.
Hahahahahaha.
Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you.
Get everybody sick in the office.
Or what? You gonna shoot me?
Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay.
Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here.
