(in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.
A spaceship, where?
Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an "Adolph Hitler"-style moustache) Do I have time to change?
I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.
(walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!
You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!
Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.
I still don't see it.
Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.
Elaine! How did you know that?
Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?
Elaine? Work?
I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)
Yes?
(concerned) Elaine, are you having a party?
They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.
Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?
Why don't you go for me?
I'm sorry!
Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd.
(staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!
(pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?
Where is it?
(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail.
Oh, DAMN this thing!
I don't see it.
(still staring at picture) Meeting?
(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.
Elaine?
I like the name "Moland". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!
Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?
(sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?
What in blazes are you listening to?
I'm looking there!
I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?
I am unfocused!
(still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?
(unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.
Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting?
I need to know what's in the mail.
Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!
Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.
Who was crying?
