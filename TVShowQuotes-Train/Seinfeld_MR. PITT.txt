(walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!
I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.
Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd.
(staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!
My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.
They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.
I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?
(unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.
Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.
Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting?
(pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?
Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?
(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.
(still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?
(sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?
Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an "Adolph Hitler"-style moustache) Do I have time to change?
Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?
Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!
I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)
I need to know what's in the mail.
(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail.
Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.
Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.
You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!
Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine?
Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?
Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?
