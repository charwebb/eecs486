Oh, DAMN this thing!
I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.
(in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.
I'm looking there!
(still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?
Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine?
A spaceship, where?
Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.
(walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!
I need to know what's in the mail.
Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an "Adolph Hitler"-style moustache) Do I have time to change?
(concerned) Elaine, are you having a party?
(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail.
(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.
Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.
Elaine? Work?
(unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.
(sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?
Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?
My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.
I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)
You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!
I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?
They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.
Elaine?
Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?
Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.
(staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!
I don't see it.
Why don't you go for me?
I am unfocused!
I like the name "Moland". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!
Where is it?
(still staring at picture) Meeting?
What in blazes are you listening to?
Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd.
Who was crying?
I still don't see it.
Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!
Yes?
Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?
I'm sorry!
Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting?
