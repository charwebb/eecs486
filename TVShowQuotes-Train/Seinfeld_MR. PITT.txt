(still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?
(sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?
You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!
(unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.
Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine?
Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting?
They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.
I need to know what's in the mail.
I like the name "Moland". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!
Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.
I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)
(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail.
Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd.
Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?
I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?
Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.
Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?
Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?
(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.
I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.
Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.
(staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!
Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?
Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an "Adolph Hitler"-style moustache) Do I have time to change?
(pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?
(in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.
Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!
