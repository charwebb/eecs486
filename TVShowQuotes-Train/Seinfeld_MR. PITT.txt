I need to know what's in the mail.
Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting?
Elaine? Work?
I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.
Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd.
(in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.
They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.
Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?
Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine?
What in blazes are you listening to?
Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.
You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!
Why don't you go for me?
(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.
I still don't see it.
Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!
(staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!
(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail.
A spaceship, where?
My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.
Oh, DAMN this thing!
I like the name "Moland". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!
I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)
Elaine?
Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?
Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.
(sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?
Elaine! How did you know that?
Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?
I am unfocused!
(unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.
Where is it?
(walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!
(still staring at picture) Meeting?
(still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?
I'm sorry!
Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an "Adolph Hitler"-style moustache) Do I have time to change?
I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?
Who was crying?
Yes?
(pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?
(concerned) Elaine, are you having a party?
(piqued interest) Oh, who's on the cover?
