Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you.
(flirtatious) You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I know a great breakfast place, right around the corner.
You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?
Well, you know, you don't look that much like him.
I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.
Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.
I wanted to give it to you in person.
Oh, no. He got held up at work.
He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.
I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.
(apologetic) Oh, I am sorry. (smiling broadly) I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend here. He looks just like you.
