He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.
I wanted to give it to you in person.
(flirtatious) You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I know a great breakfast place, right around the corner.
I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.
You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?
I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.
Oh, no. He got held up at work.
Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you.
Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.
(inviting) Why don't you come in? We'll take about it.
Well, you know, you don't look that much like him.
