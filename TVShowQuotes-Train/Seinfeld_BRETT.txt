It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...
That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.
Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?
Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going.
I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.
Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.
I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he?
Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.
Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the (reads) twelve cents?
How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.
(scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.
Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.
Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's start.
I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.
We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.
