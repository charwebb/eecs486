It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...
That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.
I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.
How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.
Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.
Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.
Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going.
I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.
(walking back to Elaine) Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue.
Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?
Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.
Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the (reads) twelve cents?
We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.
Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's start.
(scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.
