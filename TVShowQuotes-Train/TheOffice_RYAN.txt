Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
For my current investors, things are going great.
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
Why would I lie about a performance review?
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
I can't imagine what I would have done.
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
And you know that I���m capable of this.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Do you really know which one is correct?
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
You wanted to have sex in my office.
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
I don't think you know what you're saying.
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
I told you not to call about small problems.
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
Well it is business, but not as usual.
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
