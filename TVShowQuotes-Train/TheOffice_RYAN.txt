He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
I'm your boss.
Baby, Baby, Baby--
I'm on Michael.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
You were let go.
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
Eh, a little bit.
Hello?
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
I have the emergency contacts.
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
What?
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
Yeah, yeah.
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
Good luck Michael.
...I don't.
I think.
$650 bucks
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Quick question.
I stretched before I came.
Hey.
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Good. That is great to hear.
Hey, I'm WUPHF.
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
Look on the windshield.'
Thank you.
Maybe.
Merry Christmas. [hands over a gift]
Right. Okay.
I really did not do anything.
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
What's your number?
Yuh.
Love it. Go.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
No you don't.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
We���re gonna be together forever.
Where is Tibet?
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
OK. OK.
They had no yams.
No, man.  You're-- you're fine.
Do you have a question Kelly?
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
And you know that I���m capable of this.
They really didn't like me.
Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
At home, not on a boat?
Don't vaccinate it.
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
What size shoes are you guys?
You should've sent me a WUPHF.
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Um...  Yeah, absolutely.
Yup.
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
Hi, nice to meet you.
But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?
Just Curly. Joe DeRita was different.
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
Uh, okay, two?
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
You're taking two?
I'm really uncomfortable.
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
This is... totally unnecessary.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
Aww!
Fudge?
No.
Right. Think different, from Apple.
No.
Will do.
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.
What are you talking about?
Uh, fun jeans.
So who's leading this thing, anyway?
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
Same with coffee, and women.
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
OK. Should we get started?
Yep.
I did not see Rango.
Hey.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
I insist you take your work calls.
What?
Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.
Do you like The Hives?
Get off my ass, you hag.
What's up Facebook?
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
Well, it's empty.
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
Whoopi Goldberg.
Twenty.
Twice.
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Yeah, isn't that messed up?
Oh.
Can I see it?
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
Do you really know which one is correct?
No, that was mandatory.
You have another job?
Uh, no thanks, I'm good.
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
I can't wait to meet him.
Yeah, close one.
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about...
You wanted to have sex in my office.
What?
Cause he's totally gay? [walks away]
Catch-22.
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
Uhm...
Yeah.
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
Um...
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
You know what?  I didn't---
Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
Hey.
[stands up] Everything.  She's perfect.
Ah.
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?
...It wasn't personal.
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
As an object.
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
I can't believe I started the fire.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
You a big William Hung fan?
Awesome.
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
All right.
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
Are we staying til five?
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
Kelly.
Huh?
Yup.
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
Let's get a drink.
I went to Fort Lauderdale.
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
It did, all ready.
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
I gotta work on this.
Hey.
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Gotcha.
You too.
I can't imagine what I would have done.
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
Yes, I'm coming to your wedding.
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
I'm so psyched you're here!
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
Say ���hi���, Drake.
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
TBD. Phyllis?
Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
It's an investment.
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
Michael, you  haven't even heard--
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
What was that first thing you did?
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses?
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
I'd be satisfied with eight.
That's a test prep for business school.
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
Mmm-hmm.
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Oh, so close. Eighty-one.
This poem would crush you!
No, no, no, no, no.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
Yeah... Who's opening?
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
... Yeah.
I don't wanna go back in.
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
Hey.
Sometimes he brings more costumes.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
Did she say something?
Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
That's... That's not the point!
I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
Hey, you.
Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
How would...
Good.
Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
How's everybody doing?!
T-Dog?
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
This is not funny, man, let me down.
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
Write it down.
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
Yeah, you left the price tag on.
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
Fine, don't worry about that.
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
Dwight?
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
What line of work you in, Bob?
My mom also makes the best salsa.
Exactly.
A waffle?
I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
Oh, awesome.
No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
I get that.
[whispering] Who is it?
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Can you get me a cold water?
Well...
Bottle service ya'll?
Yeah.
No.
Two HR reps.
Why are you being so weird about this?
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
Hey.
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
We're behind.
Yes Michael?
You've never had Pad Thai.
Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises]
Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Thanks.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Have some faith in this idea!
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
[at a loss for words]
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
Sorry man.
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
[stops kissing Kelly] I can't do this.
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
I know it's you guys.
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
Don't you see why that's insane?
I want an outsider.
Are you scared?
Did you see Saw?
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
I'd rather not say.
He takes what he wants.
I forget it, brutha.
No, no, no.  Sir, don't listen.
No, not yet.
Kelly...
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
We can spend a couple days there.
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
[jumps in front of camera] Wuphf.com!
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
Scranton suits you.
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
Don't interrupt.
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
I'll check them all.
Yeah. [Michael closes the door]
[notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man.
This guy owns his own beet farm.
No don't take that, give that back!
Is Jim coming back.
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
[knocks on office wall] Hey.
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
The ones that say '39 cents.'
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
Free sample?
Oh, great.
Ugh.
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
Well... you look great.
No, I said your idea was stupid.
Can't really tell the...
Why would I lie about a performance review?
[whispers] Yeah.
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
No.
You don't?
Yes. I'm very excited.
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
Yes.
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
No, this little guy is mine.
Cool. Cool. OK.
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
Um... God, so many, Nellie!
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
I have something.
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
Yep, that is a problem.
You like the Fleebulls, The Glorps?
Pack my--?
Yeah, yeah I'll see them.
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
All right.
Woooo!
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
[sigh]
What?
Yeah! That was the idea.
Actually Ryan.
Thanks.
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
Stop calling us ���guys���.
What's up? Nice to meet you.
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Oh, no.
I am.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
Dwight.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
How's it going?  Good day?
[whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
I am so sorry.
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
Yeah, I might stop by.
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
Not really.  New York is...so great.
What's the dress code on this?
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
Maybe.
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
What?
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
Seems like it's leaning one way.
Sorry, dude.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
Whoo!
Explain what you think that is.
Okay.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
Michael.
Yeah.
Are you happy you did?
Rock the house!
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
What?
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
I'm doing something over here.
Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
Finally.
[again catching Jim looking at him] What?
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
Is there a prize?
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
Now I have it.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
I don't want ketchup.
We're back.
Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
Huh.
Prison sounds great.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Here you go.
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
Yes, I--
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
Yeah, punch him.
You think of something then!
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
No no, I want to go.
We have actual work to do.
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
Yeah, me too.
SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
Yeah.
I'd rather not say.
Hey. You're looking for me?
Yeah. It's another note.
OK, what's up?
Yeah me too.
Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
Will you roll those dice with me?
Everything seems pretty much under control.
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
May I go first?
[to Dwight] Don't...
Uh, fine. What's up?
Will you marry me Holly?
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
I'm good, thanks.
This is company-wide, Dwight.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
That looks great.
At three different places.
It says flavor: Blue Blast.
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
I mean whatever one you want.
Good. What's up?
Yeah, if you don't mind.
Kelly, come on.
Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.
No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept.
Okay. Do you like The Strokes?
I don't have a key.
Hi.
You staying?
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
Good for you, man. Good for you.
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
No, Stanley, do you -
OK.
Hey.
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
It was indescribable.
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
What? [they hug]
Ah, well, I'm interested in business.
We're never getting back together.
Instead of $5,000 a year from now?
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
They said something about Zach Braff.
Hello, what do we have here?
That's what I told him.  Thanks. [leaves]
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
No.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
So...
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
Yeah I make originals too.
What are the criteria for going?
Yeah.  Maybe.
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
Ok thanks Michael.
What?
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
Well, I updated it.
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
I--- I would find a way.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
I can eat.
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
C.C. me
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
Thank you everybody.
You are toxic! You are toxic!
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Never gets old.
With gift baskets.
Thank you.
Kelly don't do this.
Yeah, sure.
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
He called me Fire Guy.
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
You guys, um, talking Senator?
Oh my god!
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
Okay, no.
Thank you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Fourth quarter projections for Jan?
We totally should.
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
What do you want me to do?
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Yeah that's great.
I'm good! How are you? So...
Hey, this is fun.
Thank you, Erin. Woof!
Don't you mean constructive criticism?
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
Go make a copy, secretary.
No, you don't...
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course.
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
What about this bottle of power drink?
Yes, I'll do it.
Wait, can you go back?
Ah man, I can't.
The domain name. Yeah, they do.
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
Oh gross.
Is your wife still your contact?
Maybe we should get some air.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
Bitttch!
I can get there.
Okay.
... Later guys.
Can you find out?
They have business classes there?
Do you mean Neverland?
At least we're outside.
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Yeah!
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
You really think you're going to go?
Soda.
Profound man, your husband.
You don't want to recycle them?
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
A dime and a nickel.
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
You're inviting Jim?
I don't do that stuff anymore.
I'll use it when you're done.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Just put it out of your mind.
Michael, how's it going, bro?
You should've put him in custardy.
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Take care, man.
Hey Michael.
Um, I don't...
Quit it!
Uh, Shemp.
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
Totally, we should both work out.
Um... also--
[colorful poster with numbers] Check this out.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
Yeah?
Fozzie bear?
America is one big mall.
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
People Magazine, crossword puzzle, keep or toss?
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
And he's really into penguins or something?
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
No.
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
At these prices with this service...
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
The Washington University Public Health Fund.
Yeah.
Yes. You alone do, actually.
What?
No you weren't.
Let's bail. [starts to leave]
I know.
What nerves?
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
[reading checklist] Fun jeans.
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
That's actually a test prep book.
Absolutely.
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
You should enter it in festivals!
Ok.
What did you think of the presentation?
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
It's not irrelevant. Details
[muttering] Sometimes you over react.
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
Michael.
Stop flustering me, everybody!
I like extra cheese.
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
Where is it?
Yes.
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
I know where we're not.
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
Kelly.
Yeah, discuss these things--
What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
Are you holding this chair?
Perfect.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
I know what I said.
Yeah, I liked them too.
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
How's It Going?
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
Michael it's not... It's not...
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.
My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
Yeah.
I got the stamps.
What?
Out.
Congratulations!
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
Ahh, I don't think so, no...
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
I won't.
Great. She's cute, huh?
That's good. They're creative, you're not.
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
That is so awesome man!
Pam's better at that stuff
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
We can't do this Dwight.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
What's the hard way?
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
Wow, um... Sorry you had to...
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Why no kids?
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Yeah.
Uh, is that a vibrator?
Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
Will do.
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
Yeah, I think I can handle it.
One second.
Okay.
Yeah!
What are you doing here?
I am.
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
That's a little derivative.
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
I don't have a tape player. So...
That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
The company's probably going under, though.
Ok.
Great.
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
Yeah... Mmmmm...
No, don't. Don't do that.
OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????
Cool.
Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
I've missed you too...
I'd die for you too.
You helped me get off drugs!
I'll go.
To both these bears.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Like Frodo!
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
You know what you're doing.
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
[to Kevin] You scared me.
[unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod.
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Write a book.
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
And you got a goatee!
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
But if he doesn't?
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
You read my mind.
alright.  See you there.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
What's up?
Yeah, totally.
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
Oh, that's nice.
But...
[seems unsure] Everything... Everything.
A credit.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Dehydration.
For my current investors, things are going great.
My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
Michael and everybody, umm...
Sabre. It���s time to come home.
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Looks like they forgot the power cord.
I love it.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.
I'm trying but you need to-
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Probably, yes.
Uncle Dave?
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
No.
Wear something nice.
Who uses calling cards anymore?
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Nine?
Wow.
Thanks.
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
[throwing up]
Yeah, New York is great.
What's the occasion?
Why wouldn't they let me dance?
Yeah, let's do it that way.
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
You look so classy in that picture.
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes.
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
We heard about the punch.
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
Oh, yeah, totally.
F and C, doubletime?
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
I���m sorry,��� L���?
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Michael.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
Got it.
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
He's bluffing, Pam.
Don't just criticize my idea!
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
The only good bagels anywhere.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
The other way.
I did.
Yeah!
I didn't think it did.
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
This is from the sun.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
You're doing it man.
Who is Mao?
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
Yeah, Christmas.
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
Yeah.
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Then do it.
It's great to see you Kev.
I... wouldn't even know where to start.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
Yeah.
Uh huh.
I can field this one.
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
Oh...
What's her address? [Ryan's cell phone rings]
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
Yeah.
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
Back? Why is that Michael?
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
Yeah.
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
I won't look at it.
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
Chappelle's Show.
Fun, communication, connection.
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
I'm betting on myself.
Chiklis style.
That's all he wrote?
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.
Cool.
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
What's that?
Oh...
Oh!
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
Oh, thanks, man.
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Uh yeah, we'll meet you there.
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
All the time.
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Oh, neat.
I think it's worth it.
Na.
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
What's, uh, going on here?
We're not doing this today.
What?
You did. Yeah.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
No, she's lying.
Yeah.
Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.
Thank you. Whatcha got there?
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
Yeah.
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
We'll have to talk about this.
I go to a lot of parties.
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
Oh, no, I didn't know.
Huh?
Got that. [Metallic thud] Get down.
Updating emergency contacts.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Yeah, I figured.
What kind do you like?
No you don't.
An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
That is not correct.
I don't know, maybe.
I did.
And if I flake, I flake.
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Michael? Are you done yet?
Tough.
In you go.
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
Cool, thank you.
OK. This is...
Yo, Ry from WUPHF!'
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
Good.
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
Jan.
I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
Creed did you organize the menu book?
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
Kelly, I'm so cold!
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring?
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Yes.
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
[shakes his head]
Thought you checker my Tumblr?
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
You're kidding?
Really?
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
Why not? What are you doing?
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Yeah. Yeah.
I bet you did.
Nice. Send me a postcard.
Not really.
Okay well, that's a relief!
I felt terrorized.
Well that was funny, that's why.
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.
I would love to.
Gordon Gekko.
Oh, how did I not guess that?
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
I told you not to call about small problems.
Yes!
Nick.
What are those, a men's ten?
Kelly's helping?
Thank you very much.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
Fraud, Jim, Fraud.
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
When was China founded?
You drive.
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Stop. Stop it Andy.
Oh, my God.
What do you make, secretary?
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
No, it's whomever.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
It's inevitable, right?
Cool.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
Hey, are you going to Poor Richard's?
All right.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
Hey. I got the information.
Whoa, whoa.
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
It's my -
Hello.
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
I'm already in business school.
Me too.
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
You lied about being pregnant.
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
[Under his breath] Still.
I am not giving you my keys.
I love you.
Yeah.
I finally mastered commitment.
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Are you having fun in this relationship?
No. [Dwight starts singing in German]
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
Yeah.
I think about that all the time.
Literally.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
[from behind the door] Is there internet?
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
And you brought this guy!
Awesome!
Is that it?
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
Kay.
Um, yeah. [shakes her hand] Ryan.
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
Kelly, you���re here.
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
So, how are you?
Actually, I had mine already.
Cool.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
[to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard.
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
Thanks.
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
Take the call, friend.
Blue.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
They were out.
Hello?
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
Andy.
Yo!
Yes!
Unreal.
Huh? [puts on jacket]
Yes, yes, yes!
