Yeah, Christmas.
That's a test prep for business school.
A waffle?
Sixty thousand dollars a year.
Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
Have some faith in this idea!
A dime and a nickel.
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything.
Yeah that's great.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
...It wasn't personal.
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Updating emergency contacts.
Nick.
I'm so psyched you're here!
That's all he wrote?
Yeah... Mmmmm...
Who uses calling cards anymore?
Michael, you  haven't even heard--
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
Mmm-hmm.
[colorful poster with numbers] Check this out.
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
Things have been generally good.
Yeah.
No, this little guy is mine.
OK...
What?
Let's bail. [starts to leave]
We totally should.
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
How's everybody doing?!
Kelly don't do this.
Andy.
Um... God, so many, Nellie!
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
I'll check them all.
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
It's great to see you Kev.
Looks like they forgot the power cord.
Hey, are you going to Poor Richard's?
Whoa, whoa.
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
[from behind the door] Is there internet?
Keep going. [Whispers]
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
Oh my god!
Thank you.
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
We heard about the punch.
Ah, well, I'm interested in business.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
I think about that all the time.
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
Oh gross.
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
Fine, don't worry about that.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
TBD. Phyllis?
Uh, okay, two?
One second.
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
[kisses for a little longer]  What's up?
I get that.
Really?
[to Dwight] Don't...
That's really funny.
We're behind.
Okay, no.
-and you jump in front of them.
Just Curly. Joe DeRita was different.
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
Dwight?
I'm betting on myself.
Chappelle's Show.
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
Yeah, I might stop by.
It says flavor: Blue Blast.
Well...
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
Baby, Baby, Baby--
Out.
Yeah, you left the price tag on.
Ok.
No.
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
To both these bears.
Yeah.
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
Ahh, I don't think so, no...
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
No, man.  You're-- you're fine.
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
What?
Maybe.
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
Whoo!
Scranton suits you.
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
[reading checklist] Fun jeans.
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Prison sounds great.
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
At these prices with this service...
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
Awesome.
This is not funny, man, let me down.
What are those, a men's ten?
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
All of a sudden?
Huh.
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
Quit it!
This is from the sun.
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
Uhm...
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
Wow.
That looks great.
Hi.
What's the hard way?
Let's get a drink.
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
I don't have a key.
What's the dress code on this?
What's the halal option?
You're inviting Jim?
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
Yeah... Who's opening?
[to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard.
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Do you like The Hives?
No you don't.
Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
Yeah.
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
No, no, no.  Sir, don't listen.
Did she say something?
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
Whoopi Goldberg.
Okay.
He takes what he wants.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
I didn't think it did.
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
I know what I said.
[knocks on office wall] Hey.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
Oh...
I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
I bet you did.
America is one big mall.
[again catching Jim looking at him] What?
Oh, great.
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
We have actual work to do.
Woooo!
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
What was that first thing you did?
What's your number?
Actually, I had mine already.
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
You helped me get off drugs!
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
We'll have to talk about this.
Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
I won't look at it.
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
Then do it.
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
Sorry man.
Me too.
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
They said something about Zach Braff.
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
Uh, Shemp.
Um, yeah. [shakes her hand] Ryan.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
Yeah!
You drive.
So...
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
I really did not do anything.
That is so awesome man!
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
You staying?
Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
[whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
Hello, what do we have here?
Yeah, close one.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.
Yup.
I mean whatever one you want.
Kelly...
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
What about a long sleeve T?
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
May I go first?
Michael.
Who was that?
Depression?
What? [they hug]
Yeah!
He called me Fire Guy.
Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Right.
Love it. Go.
Uh, fun jeans.
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
And you know that I���m capable of this.
Yuh.
Oh, neat.
You're taking two?
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
I think.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Cool.
As an object.
Dehydration.
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
Yo!
I'm your boss.
It did, all ready.
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
My mom also makes the best salsa.
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
Hey.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
No, I said your idea was stupid.
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
Yep, that is a problem.
It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.
[unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod.
Ah man, I can't.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
Take care, man.
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
I told you not to call about small problems.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
This is... totally unnecessary.
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
No you weren't.
You think of something then!
Sabre. It���s time to come home.
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
You sure?
You have another job?
Yeah, I figured.
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
Like Frodo!
Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
Perfect.
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Okay.
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
Is there a prize?
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
What?
People Magazine, crossword puzzle, keep or toss?
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
Can you get me a cold water?
Yeah, yeah.
You lied about being pregnant.
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Good. What's up?
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
And you got a goatee!
Write it down.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
You've never had Pad Thai.
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
Uh huh.
Yeah, me too.
Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course.
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
I'm on Michael.
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
Okay. Do you like The Strokes?
Ugh.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
For my current investors, things are going great.
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
Tough.
You.  Us.
Everything seems pretty much under control.
Thank you everybody.
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
Yes, yes, yes!
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
Creed did you organize the menu book?
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
Fudge?
OK. OK.
Actually Ryan.
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
At three different places.
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Um...  Yeah, absolutely.
Rock the house!
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Jan.
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Yeah.
Are you happy you did?
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Okay, I'm turning it off.
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
Seems like it's leaning one way.
Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
No, don't. Don't do that.
I can field this one.
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
Take the call, friend.
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
I'll use it when you're done.
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
Quick question.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
Why wouldn't they let me dance?
No.
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
[throwing up]
[whispering] Who is it?
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
Instead of $5,000 a year from now?
Soda.
OK, what's up?
Oh, that's nice.
You know what you're doing.
Nine?
Uh, no thanks, I'm good.
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
Say ���hi���, Drake.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
So, how are you?
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
No! I will... go.
What kind do you like?
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
What?
Will do.
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
All right.
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
Here you go.
Guys, one second. [on dance videogame]
I can't believe I started the fire.
Kelly, I'm so cold!
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
Oh, no.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Finally.
Michael.
I felt terrorized.
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
OK. This is...
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
$650 bucks
Totally, we should both work out.
Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
[shakes his head]
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Stop that! Stop that!
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
You were let go.
That's actually a test prep book.
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Yeah, I think I can handle it.
Well, I updated it.
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
I've missed you too...
Profound man, your husband.
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
That's... That's not the point!
Yeah.
Yeah.
No no, I want to go.
What?
I stretched before I came.
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Nice. Send me a postcard.
I went to Fort Lauderdale.
Yes, I'll do it.
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
Ryan Howard.
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah?
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Well that was funny, that's why.
Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
And you brought this guy!
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
Yeah.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
Fozzie bear?
Did you see Saw?
Hey.
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
Eh, a little bit.
Huh?
No, she's lying.
I got the stamps.
I did.
You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
Merry Christmas. [hands over a gift]
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
Is that your Cousin Mose?
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
To madness.
Na.
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
No. It would cause me too much pain.
What about this bottle of power drink?
What do you want me to do?
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
We're not doing this today.
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
I don't know what you're talking about.
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Uh yeah, we'll meet you there.
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
I don't wanna go back in.
Yeah, isn't that messed up?
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
I can get there.
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
I'm doing something over here.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
You really think you're going to go?
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
The domain name. Yeah, they do.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
Yeah. It's another note.
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
No don't take that, give that back!
I finally mastered commitment.
I won't.
The only good bagels anywhere.
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
I have the emergency contacts.
Okay.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
Yeah, yeah I'll see them.
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
You should enter it in festivals!
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
Do you have a question Kelly?
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
You wanted to have sex in my office.
Blue.
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
[seems unsure] Everything... Everything.
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
Not really.  New York is...so great.
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
He's rubbing his neck.
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
Huh?
How would...
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about...
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
No. [Dwight starts singing in German]
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
I-
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
No, Stanley, do you -
Hey.
No, that was mandatory.
No no no.
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Thank you.
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
We're never getting back together.
You did. Yeah.
A credit.
No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept.
What's up?
Who is Mao?
We can spend a couple days there.
I love you.
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
That's good. They're creative, you're not.
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
What did you think of the presentation?
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Fourth quarter projections for Jan?
What's the occasion?
Ok, to what?
Hi, nice to meet you.
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
Oh, how did I not guess that?
I insist you take your work calls.
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Is your wife still your contact?
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
Twice.
Yeah.
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
Oh, awesome.
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
And?
Don't interrupt.
I think it's worth it.
Hey.
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
I know.
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Thanks.
Hey.
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
What line of work you in, Bob?
Yes Michael?
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
Oh!
I'm trying but you need to-
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
That is not correct.
No.
I'd rather not say.
Why no kids?
T-Dog?
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises]
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
Cool, thank you.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
[stops kissing Kelly] I can't do this.
You know what?
Yeah, let's do it that way.
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
We're back.
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
Aww!
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
Right. Okay.
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
Yeah.
I'm really uncomfortable.
Michael and everybody, umm...
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
I'll go.
The ones that say '39 cents.'
Oh...
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
Thought you checker my Tumblr?
... Yeah.
Explain what you think that is.
Don't vaccinate it.
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Well, it's empty.
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
[notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man.
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
Thank you.
Kelly.
Yeah.
Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.
Yes. I'm very excited.
Yep.
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Free sample?
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
All right.
What?
Um... also--
All the time.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Good.
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
What's that?
Cause he's totally gay? [walks away]
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
Yeah, totally.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
What?
No you don't.
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
Are we staying til five?
This poem would crush you!
Cool.
I'm good, thanks.
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
Hey. You're looking for me?
Thank you. Whatcha got there?
Fun, communication, connection.
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
[sigh]
Will you marry me Holly?
Can you find out?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Pam's better at that stuff
Um...
Now I have it.
Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?
You should've put him in custardy.
You're doing it man.
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
Yes.
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
Well it is business, but not as usual.
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
What?
Yeah.
[whispers] Yeah.
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
No.
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
You like the Fleebulls, The Glorps?
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
They had no yams.
It's not irrelevant. Details
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Good.
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
Yeah.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
What?
Bottle service ya'll?
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
[muttering] Sometimes you over react.
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
Unreal.
Good. That is great to hear.
Kelly, come on.
That's what I told him.  Thanks. [leaves]
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
At home, not on a boat?
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
Nice.
Yeah. [Michael closes the door]
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
I have something.
What nerves?
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
You too.
Uncle Dave?
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
You're my friend, Michael.  OK?
I like extra cheese.
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
Oh, yeah, totally.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
The other way.
That we're having any problem at all.
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
What?
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
What's her address? [Ryan's cell phone rings]
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
You should've sent me a WUPHF.
I don't know, maybe.
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
Yeah.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
Yup.
...I don't.
I know where we're not.
I never went to Thailand.
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
Hey, you.
You a big William Hung fan?
Smokey's dead.
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
Yeah, discuss these things--
With vodka, you're the best.
We did it !
I don't think you know what you're saying.
Wait, can you go back?
Sorry, dude.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
Awesome!
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
Mm-hmm.
I can't wait to meet him.
What?
Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
... Later guys.
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
We���re gonna be together forever.
Yeah I make originals too.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
At least we're outside.
Is that it?
Ah.
Maybe we should get some air.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
Right. Think different, from Apple.
Yeah.
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
Hello?
Get off my ass, you hag.
Where is it?
I gotta work on this.
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
Don't you see why that's insane?
Cool. Cool. OK.
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
Pack my--?
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
Yeah?
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
Yeah, sure.
But if he doesn't?
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
Yes, I--
You are very welcome.
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
I can't imagine what I would have done.
Literally.
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
All right.
Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring?
Darryl Rogers?
I forget it, brutha.
What's up Facebook?
Oh, my God.
But...
Well... you look great.
I--- I would find a way.
Back? Why is that Michael?
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
No.
I don't have a tape player. So...
Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?
I'm good! How are you? So...
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
Uh, fine. What's up?
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
Hey.
Thanks.
You look so classy in that picture.
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
No.
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
Hey, this is fun.
And if I flake, I flake.
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Yeah.
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
No.
Oh.
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
They were out.
You are toxic! You are toxic!
Thanks.
[stands up] Everything.  She's perfect.
That's a little derivative.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
I am.
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes.
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
How's It Going?
Okay.
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
What are you talking about?
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
Hey Michael.
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
Why not? What are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
Got that. [Metallic thud] Get down.
You're kidding?
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
Ok thanks Michael.
For Kelly?
Yeah.
You know what?  I didn't---
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
No.
Definitely.
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
So who's leading this thing, anyway?
[jumps in front of camera] Wuphf.com!
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
Yes, I'm coming to your wedding.
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Oh, thanks, man.
Can't really tell the...
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
I can eat.
Write a book.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Cool.
My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
I'd rather not say.
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
He's bluffing, Pam.
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
It's inevitable, right?
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
Michael it's not... It's not...
OK. Should we get started?
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Ok.
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
You don't?
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
What are the criteria for going?
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
Living in the moment.
Fraud, Jim, Fraud.
Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
Don't you mean constructive criticism?
Catch-22.
How about rainbows?
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.
But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
Good for you, man. Good for you.
Yes!
Are you having fun in this relationship?
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Twenty.
Absolutely.
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
When was China founded?
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
What do you make, secretary?
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
Do you really know which one is correct?
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
Okay... uh, sorry?
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
Stop flustering me, everybody!
Congratulations!
Two HR reps.
Um, I don't...
Kelly.
Don't just criticize my idea!
Gotcha.
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
Yeah, New York is great.
Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
Hello?
I���m sorry,��� L���?
alright.  See you there.
Hey. I got the information.
It's my -
C.C. me
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
Yes.
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
I did.
Michael, how's it going, bro?
What?
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
Great. She's cute, huh?
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Uh, is that a vibrator?
I... wouldn't even know where to start.
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
OK.
Never gets old.
Are you scared?
Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
Just put it out of your mind.
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
This is company-wide, Dwight.
Kay.
You guys, um, talking Senator?
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
Actually, it was.
Cool.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
Hello?
Okay well, that's a relief!
F and C, doubletime?
[at a loss for words]
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Good work, buddy.
Gordon Gekko.
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
Great.
What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
Why are you being so weird about this?
Maybe.
You read my mind.
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Yo, Ry from WUPHF!'
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
Just started.
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
Where is Tibet?
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses?
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
Yes. You alone do, actually.
Got it.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
It was indescribable.
Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
The company's probably going under, though.
Yes.
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
It's from '99.
Michael.
Robert, you are too kind.
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Stop calling us ���guys���.
Oh, so close. Eighty-one.
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
Yeah, if you don't mind.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
What's up? Nice to meet you.
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
Hey, is Katy coming?
Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
I know it's you guys.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
Good luck Michael.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
I love it.
You don't want to recycle them?
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Kelly's helping?
No, you don't...
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
I go to a lot of parties.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
Is Jim coming back.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Yeah! That was the idea.
Okay.
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
With gift baskets.
Yeah.
Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
Yeah, I liked them too.
