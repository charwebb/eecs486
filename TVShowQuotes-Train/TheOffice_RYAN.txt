Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
I can't imagine what I would have done.
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
I don't think you know what you're saying.
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
For my current investors, things are going great.
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
I told you not to call about small problems.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
Why would I lie about a performance review?
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Why are you being so weird about this?
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Do you really know which one is correct?
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
You wanted to have sex in my office.
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
No. It would cause me too much pain.
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Well it is business, but not as usual.
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
This is not funny, man, let me down.
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
