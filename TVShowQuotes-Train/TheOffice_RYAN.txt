Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
Why are you being so weird about this?
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
This is not funny, man, let me down.
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
I don't think you know what you're saying.
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
Well it is business, but not as usual.
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
Why would I lie about a performance review?
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
I told you not to call about small problems.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
For my current investors, things are going great.
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
I can't imagine what I would have done.
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
And you know that I���m capable of this.
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
Do you really know which one is correct?
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
