I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
[to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard.
I've missed you too...
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
At these prices with this service...
What's up?
Oh, that's nice.
Where is it?
Perfect.
Yeah, me too.
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
But if he doesn't?
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
Ugh.
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
I'm trying but you need to-
Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
What are you doing here?
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Michael, you  haven't even heard--
Ah, well, I'm interested in business.
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
[to Dwight] Don't...
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
You staying?
Okay, no.
Yeah... Mmmmm...
I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
Wear something nice.
You helped me get off drugs!
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
Everything seems pretty much under control.
I know what I said.
Good luck Michael.
Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?
Free sample?
We're not doing this today.
[unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod.
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
Yeah! That was the idea.
No, no, no, no, no.
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
All the time.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
It's an investment.
Blue.
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
You're taking two?
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
Jan.
Fraud, Jim, Fraud.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
I can't- I can't not touch it.
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
I don't know, maybe.
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
Cool.
The other way.
Thanks.
[from behind the door] Is there internet?
Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.
Now I have it.
OK. Should we get started?
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
We heard about the punch.
Instead of $5,000 a year from now?
This is... totally unnecessary.
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
I am so sorry.
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
Yes Michael?
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
Oh!
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
What?
Yeah.
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
Dwight.
Hey.
Oh.
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
Quit it!
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
Not really.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
I did.
It's my -
[stops kissing Kelly] I can't do this.
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
Yes, I--
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
Okay.
Yeah?
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
I did.
Will you marry me Holly?
How much memory does it have without the booster?
I don't have a tape player. So...
And you got a goatee!
No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
I think it's worth it.
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Here you go.
Uh, is that a vibrator?
Finally.
That's actually a test prep book.
No.
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
...It doesn't apply.
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
I love it.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
What's the dress code on this?
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
Look on the windshield.'
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
Uh, fine. What's up?
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
Hey, is Katy coming?
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
...I don't.
Scranton suits you.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept.
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Yeah, I might stop by.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
Uh, okay, two?
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Yeah.  Maybe.
You don't?
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Yes.
The company's probably going under, though.
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
Catch-22.
Okay, I'm turning it off.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
You sure?
OK. This is...
Is Jim coming back.
alright.  See you there.
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
Twenty.
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Oh, great.
You know what you're doing.
It was indescribable.
Okay.
Ok thanks Michael.
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
Yeah.
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
I gotta work on this.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Um... also--
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
That's really funny.
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
Ok.
Um... God, so many, Nellie!
Pam's better at that stuff
Maybe.
Yeah. It's another note.
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
Just put it out of your mind.
They had no yams.
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
Like Frodo!
My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
Hey.
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Why wouldn't they let me dance?
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
Guys, one second. [on dance videogame]
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
And he's really into penguins or something?
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
Uh, no thanks, I'm good.
Twice.
Updating emergency contacts.
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
I bet you did.
What?
OK.
I like extra cheese.
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
Yeah, I figured.
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
What size shoes are you guys?
Yeah.
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
Hey, I'm WUPHF.
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
No. [Dwight starts singing in German]
I-
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
Just started.
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
I get that.
Really?
Ryan Howard.
Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
Yeah me too.
And?
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
Let's bail. [starts to leave]
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
I know where we're not.
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
We���re gonna be together forever.
No, that was mandatory.
Chiklis style.
The only good bagels anywhere.
Probably, yes.
Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.
Get off my ass, you hag.
I can eat.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
[whispers] Yeah.
Good for you, man. Good for you.
Keep going. [Whispers]
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
Depression?
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
No don't take that, give that back!
Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.
Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
Yeah, I think I can handle it.
I think about that all the time.
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
At three different places.
You're my friend, Michael.  OK?
Is that your Cousin Mose?
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
You lied about being pregnant.
No.
I won't.
You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
One second.
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Eh, a little bit.
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
Yeah, let's do it that way.
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
Bottle service ya'll?
You did. Yeah.
I don't wanna go back in.
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
Robert, you are too kind.
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
Great. She's cute, huh?
A credit.
Wait, can you go back?
Okay. Do you like The Strokes?
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
Why no kids?
This is not funny, man, let me down.
With gift baskets.
The domain name. Yeah, they do.
Take care, man.
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.
Michael, how's it going, bro?
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
Michael it's not... It's not...
We're back.
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
You should enter it in festivals!
My mom also makes the best salsa.
Yeah!
-and you jump in front of them.
OK...
Literally.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Dwight?
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
What?
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
Fourth quarter projections for Jan?
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
[sigh]
Hello?
Unreal.
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
... Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, this is fun.
Fun, communication, connection.
Why are you being so weird about this?
Yeah.
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
Quick question.
He takes what he wants.
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Are we staying til five?
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
Are you holding this chair?
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
Oh, no.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
That is not correct.
No.
Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
Okay...
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Awesome.
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
Thanks.
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
You're kidding?
I'm really uncomfortable.
To both these bears.
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
In you go.
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
Well, I updated it.
Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses?
What's up Facebook?
Kelly, you���re here.
Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
Well that was funny, that's why.
Yeah I make originals too.
I can't wait to meet him.
Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
Oh, how did I not guess that?
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
Looks like they forgot the power cord.
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
Hey.
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
What?
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
Cool.
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
What?
No you weren't.
No no, I want to go.
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
Take the call, friend.
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
What are those, a men's ten?
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
I felt terrorized.
I'll go.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
Good.
How would...
Stop calling us ���guys���.
You guys, um, talking Senator?
Thank you, Erin. Woof!
It says flavor: Blue Blast.
Explain what you think that is.
Me too.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Yeah.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
Got it.
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Out.
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
Yeah, close one.
Actually Ryan.
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about...
[at a loss for words]
Yeah.
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
Whoopi Goldberg.
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Hello, what do we have here?
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
Don't vaccinate it.
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
Profound man, your husband.
Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
Actually, it was.
[kisses for a little longer]  What's up?
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
What? [they hug]
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Oh, my God.
What's that?
Can you find out?
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
I mean whatever one you want.
You like the Fleebulls, The Glorps?
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
What do you make, secretary?
Yeah.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
Maybe.
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
I insist you take your work calls.
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
Woooo!
Merry Christmas. [hands over a gift]
It's great to see you Kev.
It's inevitable, right?
No.
What's, uh, going on here?
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
What's the hard way?
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
No no no.
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
Go make a copy, secretary.
I went to Fort Lauderdale.
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
When was China founded?
Yes, yes, yes!
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
You wanted to have sex in my office.
You really think you're going to go?
Good.
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
Huh?
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
Hey. You're looking for me?
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
Okay.
Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
No, I said your idea was stupid.
Fine, don't worry about that.
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
Who uses calling cards anymore?
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
[whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Why not? What are you doing?
No.
Back? Why is that Michael?
I can't believe I started the fire.
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
Ah man, I can't.
Thank you.
It's from '99.
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
I go to a lot of parties.
And you know that I���m capable of this.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
Yuh.
Right. Okay.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
Yep, that is a problem.
Uh, Shemp.
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
Thank you.
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
No.
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
I don't have a key.
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
Huh? [puts on jacket]
Right. Think different, from Apple.
All right.
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
Um, yeah. [shakes her hand] Ryan.
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
You a big William Hung fan?
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.
Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes.
I don't want ketchup.
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Sabre. It���s time to come home.
Michael.
Yes.
Yes!
That looks great.
Yeah.
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
What's the occasion?
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
Huh.
No, don't. Don't do that.
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
I--- I would find a way.
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
What nerves?
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
That we're having any problem at all.
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
I am.
Two HR reps.
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
Hey.
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
Stop that! Stop that!
You think of something then!
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
Is there a prize?
Tough.
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Then do it.
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
$650 bucks
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
[notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man.
OK, what's up?
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
Do you like The Hives?
Sixty thousand dollars a year.
You're inviting Jim?
I can field this one.
Hey, you.
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
America is one big mall.
I'll use it when you're done.
I'm good! How are you? So...
Nice. Send me a postcard.
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
Kelly, I'm so cold!
Sorry, dude.
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Yeah that's great.
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Good. That is great to hear.
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
Yes.
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
Oh, neat.
[shakes his head]
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
What?
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
Yeah.
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
Cool.
Nick.
The Washington University Public Health Fund.
A dime and a nickel.
Bitttch!
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
Did this happen on company property?
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
I don't do that stuff anymore.
Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
Yeah, totally.
What are the criteria for going?
Where is Tibet?
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
They were out.
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
Yes!
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
I got the stamps.
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
Yep.
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Okay.
Chappelle's Show.
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
What about this bottle of power drink?
Yes, I'm coming to your wedding.
Did she say something?
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
No.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Oh, thanks, man.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
I didn't think it did.
[whispering] Who is it?
Do you have a question Kelly?
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
Do you really know which one is correct?
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Uh, fun jeans.
We did it !
Oh, yeah, totally.
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
Uncle Dave?
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
No, she's lying.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
I'd die for you too.
Absolutely.
Yeah. Yeah.
Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
So who's leading this thing, anyway?
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
No, man.  You're-- you're fine.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Ah.
How's everybody doing?!
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
May I go first?
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
Yeah!
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
I... wouldn't even know where to start.
Ok, to what?
Yeah.
Are you having fun in this relationship?
Hey.
I have something.
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
I don't think you know what you're saying.
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
You're doing it man.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?
Good. What's up?
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
He's rubbing his neck.
C.C. me
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
Yeah... Who's opening?
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
Fudge?
Yeah, Christmas.
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
Thank you.
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
Stop. Stop it Andy.
No.
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
Yeah, isn't that messed up?
Creed did you organize the menu book?
Not really.  New York is...so great.
He's bluffing, Pam.
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
That's a little derivative.
F and C, doubletime?
[stands up] Everything.  She's perfect.
I told you not to call about small problems.
I���m sorry,��� L���?
Um...  Yeah, absolutely.
Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
Cool.
Oh...
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
Michael? Are you done yet?
Actually, I had mine already.
Mm-hmm.
And you brought this guy!
Are you scared?
Oh my god!
Totally, we should both work out.
Gotcha.
Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
Will you roll those dice with me?
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
What do you want me to do?
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
Oh, so close. Eighty-one.
Just Curly. Joe DeRita was different.
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
...It wasn't personal.
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Yo, Ry from WUPHF!'
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
I can get there.
Hey.
Yeah?
We're never getting back together.
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
They said something about Zach Braff.
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
Gordon Gekko.
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
A waffle?
I'm doing something over here.
That's... great, I... that's awesome.
You look so classy in that picture.
Wow, um... Sorry you had to...
Thank you everybody.
And if I flake, I flake.
Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
No.
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Andy.
Sometimes he brings more costumes.
No, Stanley, do you -
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
What line of work you in, Bob?
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
Yes. I'm very excited.
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
Hello?
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
You drive.
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
Oh...
T-Dog?
Michael.
No, no, no.  Sir, don't listen.
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
Oh, no, I didn't know.
But...
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Can I see it?
We're behind.
Yeah. [Michael closes the door]
I can't imagine what I would have done.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
[muttering] Sometimes you over react.
I'm already in business school.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
What's your number?
[colorful poster with numbers] Check this out.
Soda.
Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
I would love to.
Can you get me a cold water?
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
[jumps in front of camera] Wuphf.com!
Kelly, come on.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
Yeah.
Well, it's empty.
You.  Us.
Don't you see why that's insane?
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
I know.
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
Yeah.
That's a test prep for business school.
OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????
People Magazine, crossword puzzle, keep or toss?
Hello?
How's it going?  Good day?
I am not giving you my keys.
Seems like it's leaning one way.
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Yeah, you left the price tag on.
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
Hey.
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
I never went to Thailand.
Well it is business, but not as usual.
I'll check them all.
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
Nine?
Thank you very much.
Baby, Baby, Baby--
[Under his breath] Still.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
Uh yeah, we'll meet you there.
Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
Huh?
Got that. [Metallic thud] Get down.
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Is that it?
No you don't.
Right.
Don't interrupt.
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
What did you think of the presentation?
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
Yes, I'll do it.
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
You should've put him in custardy.
Awesome!
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
They really didn't like me.
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
How about rainbows?
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
This is company-wide, Dwight.
Congratulations!
You were let go.
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
What kind do you like?
For Kelly?
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
Kelly.
How's It Going?
Yeah.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
I am.
He called me Fire Guy.
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
Yeah, yeah I'll see them.
This guy owns his own beet farm.
That's good. They're creative, you're not.
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
Hello.
With vodka, you're the best.
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
I'd be satisfied with eight.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
Wow.
Dehydration.
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
[reading checklist] Fun jeans.
Uhm...
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
Hey. I got the information.
Whoo!
Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course.
Kelly's helping?
Why would I lie about a performance review?
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
Michael.
Hey, are you going to Poor Richard's?
Yeah.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
What's her address? [Ryan's cell phone rings]
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
Love it. Go.
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
That's... That's not the point!
Oh gross.
Can't really tell the...
No, it's whomever.
I'm your boss.
An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
What's the halal option?
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
It's not irrelevant. Details
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
So...
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
Yup.
All right.
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
What?
Yeah, discuss these things--
Sorry man.
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
You read my mind.
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
Kelly...
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
You have another job?
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
Will do.
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
All of a sudden?
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
Let's get a drink.
We can spend a couple days there.
Exactly.
Yeah.
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
Is your wife still your contact?
We'll have to talk about this.
Pack my--?
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
I'm so psyched you're here!
I want an outsider.
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
I have the emergency contacts.
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
No you don't.
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Do you mean Neverland?
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
Rock the house!
I really did not do anything.
Ahh, I don't think so, no...
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
You know what?  I didn't---
As an object.
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
What?
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
Yo!
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
That's what I told him.  Thanks. [leaves]
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
OK. OK.
Na.
Okay.
Thanks.
Yeah, New York is great.
I'm on Michael.
We totally should.
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
That is so awesome man!
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
Thank you.
What?
I'd rather not say.
Nice.
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything.
[again catching Jim looking at him] What?
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
... Later guys.
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Hey.
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
I finally mastered commitment.
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
What?
Oh, awesome.
Um, I don't...
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
Okay... uh, sorry?
You are toxic! You are toxic!
For my current investors, things are going great.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Yeah.
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Yeah.
Stop flustering me, everybody!
Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises]
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
Darryl Rogers?
Who was that?
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Have some faith in this idea!
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
Who is Mao?
TBD. Phyllis?
You are very welcome.
Cause he's totally gay? [walks away]
Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
I forget it, brutha.
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
Um...
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
Same with coffee, and women.
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
Yup.
Yeah.
Don't just criticize my idea!
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
Great.
We have actual work to do.
That's all he wrote?
Whoa, whoa.
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
Say ���hi���, Drake.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
Cool, thank you.
I'd rather not say.
Smokey's dead.
Ok.
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Maybe we should get some air.
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
At home, not on a boat?
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
This is from the sun.
Thank you. Whatcha got there?
Things have been generally good.
All right.
