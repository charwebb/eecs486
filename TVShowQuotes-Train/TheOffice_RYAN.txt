I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
And you know that I���m capable of this.
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
I told you not to call about small problems.
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
I don't think you know what you're saying.
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
I can't imagine what I would have done.
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
Why are you being so weird about this?
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Well it is business, but not as usual.
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
Why would I lie about a performance review?
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
This is not funny, man, let me down.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
You wanted to have sex in my office.
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
Do you really know which one is correct?
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
