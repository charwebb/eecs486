Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
I don't think you know what you're saying.
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
I can't imagine what I would have done.
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
Why are you being so weird about this?
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
Do you really know which one is correct?
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
And you know that I���m capable of this.
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
I told you not to call about small problems.
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
This is not funny, man, let me down.
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
For my current investors, things are going great.
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
Well it is business, but not as usual.
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
You wanted to have sex in my office.
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
