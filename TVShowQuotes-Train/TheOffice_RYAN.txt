Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
And you know that I���m capable of this.
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
Why are you being so weird about this?
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
Why would I lie about a performance review?
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
For my current investors, things are going great.
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
Do you really know which one is correct?
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Well it is business, but not as usual.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
I told you not to call about small problems.
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
This is not funny, man, let me down.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
You wanted to have sex in my office.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
I can't imagine what I would have done.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
