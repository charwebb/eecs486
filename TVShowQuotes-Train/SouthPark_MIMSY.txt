Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss?
Dahhh you sure got it stuck it to you this year, boss.
No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it. 
Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss?
D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel?  You know, tell 'em you don't wanna go and just see how they react.  Wait wait, I got it.  Shut up, Mimsy!
Darrr we want the ukulele solo! We want the ukulele solo!
D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. "Ah I drove a Lincoln before I got paid to drive one. Drrrr." 
Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss? 
Well we wants ya to play it, don't we?
D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss.
Darrr, you set to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss.
D'I was gonna show him how to play the solo, boss.
Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace?
Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle. 
Dahh I don't think he's playing the right note, boss. The C4 aint gonna go off.
Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh?  Oh! It's a snake.
Aww, dah, jee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh? 
Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off.  Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death. 
Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh buss?
Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha.
D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss?
D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark. 
D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr.
Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt?
Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?
D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss?
Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss?
D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!
D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em?
Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'
