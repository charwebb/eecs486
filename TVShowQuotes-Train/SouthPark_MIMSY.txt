D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss?

D'ah oh boy!

Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss?

Why sure it is, boss.

Dahhh I got me a shark whistle.

Dahhhoh boy!

D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em?

D'awww, we don't like camp, boss?

D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. "Ah I drove a Lincoln before I got paid to drive one. Drrrr." 

Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off.  Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death. 

Well we wants ya to play it, don't we?

D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!

No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it. 

Aww, dah, jee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh? 

D'ah, it's an analogy.

D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss.

Darrr, you set to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss.

Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha.

Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh?  Oh! It's a snake.

D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss?

Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt?

D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr.

Yeah?

Aw yeah, don't mind me.

D'I was gonna show him how to play the solo, boss.

D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark. 

D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss?

Dohoho, oh boy!

Doh, sorry, boss.

Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?

Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss?

Dahhh you sure got it stuck it to you this year, boss.

Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss?

D'oh boy!

Dahh okay boss. 

Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh buss?

Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle. 

Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss? 

Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'

Dahh okay. It's real easy. You just play it like this. 

I got it, boss. Switch the map. Switch the map. 

Darrr we want the ukulele solo! We want the ukulele solo!

D'uh I don't know, boss.

D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel?  You know, tell 'em you don't wanna go and just see how they react.  Wait wait, I got it.  Shut up, Mimsy!
