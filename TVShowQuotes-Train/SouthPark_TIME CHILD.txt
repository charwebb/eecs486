Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?
No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!
Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going?
No, see, I know it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually did freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It it backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future.
... I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle. Just stop me from freezing myself, and I will get down on my knees, and I will suck your balls. I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle. 
Well I don't notice anything different, KIT-9! Do you?
No! Don't listen to me! Tell me to go screw myself!
I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!
Aw damnit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die!
Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?!
No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!
No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer.
Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?
No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously. Here, talk to my robot dog. 
Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t!
No, no, I have me.  All right, all right, listen! Listen to me carefully! You need to be patient!
