Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance!  You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?

Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?!

Haaarrr!  Aw, God, what am I gonna do? 

That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?

You... you're right. You're right. 

Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive.  Thank you, baby. Thank you.

No. No. Make it stop.

Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! 

But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.

Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!

Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time. 

Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them.

AAaaagh!  No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you. 

Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?

They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!

Aaaarr! Uh.  Oh why? Why? 

Baaaaa!  I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye!  Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! 

Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later.

What? Who are you?  "Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class." Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there.  Hrh.

Amazing book, Butters. 

That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?

The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. 

Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a...

Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on.

Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am.

Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!

What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!

No.

Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!! 

Huhuh Huh? Stop screwing around!

Huh? Uh, what?

Good-bye?

What the-? 

Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked.

Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete.

Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed.

Hey! What's going on?

Well, why the hell don't you stop them?

Stop screwin' aROUND!!

Awww, do we need Mackey here?

Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!

What? What's that, son?

I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. 

Yes, you did!

Our students committing suicide?

Why?

How do we do that?

What? Hey! Go on!  You're screwing around in here! 

I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.

Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.

Everything is going to be awesome now!

Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class.
