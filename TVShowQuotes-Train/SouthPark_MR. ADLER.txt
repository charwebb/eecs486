He doesn't look any different to me.

Good-bye, cruel world.  Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell! 

I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.

Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?!

What? Who are you?  "Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class." Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there.  Hrh.

Why?

Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed.

You... you're right. You're right. 

Stop screwin' aROUND!!

The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. 

What the-? 

Good-bye?

Our students committing suicide?

That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?

Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am.

Don't screw aROUND!

What? Hey! Go on!  You're screwing around in here! 

Aaaarr! Uh.  Oh why? Why? 

Hey! What's going on?

Awww, do we need Mackey here?

Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class.

Haaarrr!  Aw, God, what am I gonna do? 

No.

This way, ma'am

But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.

That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?

Well, why the hell don't you stop them?

Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time. 

Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.

Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! 

Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a...

Bras?

Amazing book, Butters. 

What? What's that, son?

Baaaaa!  I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye!  Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! 

What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!

Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete.

AAaaagh!  No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you. 

How do we do that?

Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?

Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them.

Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!

Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive.  Thank you, baby. Thank you.

Yes, you did!

Huhuh Huh? Stop screwing around!

Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!! 

I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. 

Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!

Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance!  You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?

Everything is going to be awesome now!

No. No. Make it stop.

Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!
