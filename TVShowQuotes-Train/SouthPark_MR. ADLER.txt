Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a...
The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. 
What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!
But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.
Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later.
What? Who are you?  "Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class." Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there.  Hrh.
Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! 
I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
Well, why the hell don't you stop them?
Haaarrr!  Aw, God, what am I gonna do? 
Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am.
That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?
Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class.
Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them.
AAaaagh!  No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you. 
They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!
Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked.
Baaaaa!  I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye!  Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! 
Good-bye, cruel world.  Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell! 
Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?
Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance!  You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?
Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?!
What? Hey! Go on!  You're screwing around in here! 
I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. 
Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive.  Thank you, baby. Thank you.
