Good-bye, cruel world.  Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell! 
Baaaaa!  I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye!  Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! 
Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on.
Well, why the hell don't you stop them?
I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
What? Hey! Go on!  You're screwing around in here! 
Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.
That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?
Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked.
Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them.
But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a...
AAaaagh!  No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you. 
Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. 
Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?
Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! 
Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive.  Thank you, baby. Thank you.
Haaarrr!  Aw, God, what am I gonna do? 
I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. 
What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!
Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete.
Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?!
Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am.
Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class.
They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!
What? Who are you?  "Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class." Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there.  Hrh.
