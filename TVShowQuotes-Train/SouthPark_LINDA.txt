I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 
Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.
Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.
Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.
Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?
Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!
I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!  Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- 
If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.
Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!
Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!
No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.
Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!
Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.
We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.
I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. 
Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? 
I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.
... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.
I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.
Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door. 
Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.
To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.
Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS 
No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.
What are you spending all that money on, Butters?
Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!
How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.
What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!
I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!
Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.
Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! 
Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.
Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.
Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.
Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
Hey, I think you'd make a great father.
Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.
We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
...Don't you make that face at me, young man!
You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?
Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.
No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive.
...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.
Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! 
He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.
I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!
Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.
Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?
Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.
Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.
You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!
Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. 
Butters, what have you done to your hair? 
Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.
Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?
No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs.
OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
Cartman:
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.  Eh. 
Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe.  I just love the cute little canarian on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. 
What on earth is the matter with him?
"Dear bastard husband," No.  "Dear lying sonofabitch," No.  "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-"
If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? 
Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?
Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!
And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?
Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.
We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.
I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. 
Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.
Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?
Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?
This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.
And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? 
Our darling Butters never came home last night.
Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.
Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?
A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! "(Punch)"
You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.
We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!
The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.
Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?
Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? 
I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.
It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?
Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?
Mark? Mark, look.  Well, hello. What's your name?  What- what do you want?
Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!
The rest of the f- you do mean us?
This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! 
Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.
You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.
Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! 
He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... 
Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.
Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!
Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? 
Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?
Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?
Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?
Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.
And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.
No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector?
