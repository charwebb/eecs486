OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
Cartman:
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.  Eh. 
What are you spending all that money on, Butters?
... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.
Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?
Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.
Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! 
It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?
You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe.  I just love the cute little canarian on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. 
Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! 
You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.
Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS 
Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?
If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.
You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! "(Punch)"
No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.
That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.
Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!
Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?
Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.
Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?
Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!
Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.
Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.
Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?  You are grounded, mister!
We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.
Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.
Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?
What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!
Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.
Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?
Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door. 
I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 
Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.
Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.
Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? 
We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!
Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.
Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.
And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.
I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!
Our darling Butters never came home last night.
Mark? Mark, look.  Well, hello. What's your name?  What- what do you want?
Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!
To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.
Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? 
Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
"Dear bastard husband," No.  "Dear lying sonofabitch," No.  "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-"
No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs.
Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.
NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!
Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.
I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. 
Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!
And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.
I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! 
I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.
Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. 
What on earth is the matter with him?
If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? 
No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.
I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!  Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- 
Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!
I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
Butters, what have you done to your hair? 
...Don't you make that face at me, young man!
Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. 
Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?
Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.
I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?
Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!
Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? 
Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! 
Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.
No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.
What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!
Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.
How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?
Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.
Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? 
Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.
I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.
I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.
Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? 
You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.
Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?
Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?
We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive.
Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!
The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.
Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.
Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.
It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.
The rest of the f- you do mean us?
Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!
Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.
He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... 
Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.
We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.
Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!
Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?
No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? 
I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.
Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!
