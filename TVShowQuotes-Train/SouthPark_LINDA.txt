You just march on in there.

Yes!!

A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.

Mark, are we doing the right thing?

I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!  Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- 

What is that? Chris, what is that?

And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.

Bye, sweetie, we love you!

Butters, time for bed.

A penis is loose in our kitchen!

What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!

Butters, put your clothes on.

Stephen, what is this place?

Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.

Little girl, you shouldn't be working here.

Hey, kids.

I have to do it, Steven.

Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!

I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 

Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.

Ohh Godd!! 

Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. 

Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? 

Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe.  I just love the cute little canarian on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. 

You don't know anything!

It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?

What is it?! Acid?!

Goodnight, baby. 

What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!

NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!!

Then why, Chris, why?!

Good morning, Butters.

This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!

Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.

The rest of the f- you do mean us?

Oh, you!

Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.

Butters, what on earth are you doing??

"Dear bastard husband," No.  "Dear lying sonofabitch," No.  "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-"

Butters? 

Why not?

Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.

I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.

Butters, why?? Oh my God!

Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age!

What?

Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.

Oh no.  NO!

Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.

Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! 

No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.

Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.

Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?

Your T.M.I.?

If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.

We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!

Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!

Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.

Hmmm...

And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?

...Don't you make that face at me, young man!

Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.

Okay. 

Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! 

This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.

Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?

Then we can go with him.

No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? 

Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? 

Here we go. 

Oh Butters!

Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.

Online

Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.

What?

Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.

Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!

... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.

What?!

Oh my God, Butters!

I'm your engineer.

Butters?  Butters?! 

I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.

How much? For Butters?

I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.

The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.

Butters, you have some visitors. 

AAAAAAAAH!! 

Oh. Sure.

Oh no. NO!  Aaaah! 

Score one for us atheists

Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? 

Stop it!

What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??

Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.

I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!

Oh my God...

Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!

No! No!

Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?  You are grounded, mister!

What's going on, you two?

I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!

Yes, I... remember hearing something about that.

Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!

Huh?

Aw, that's just adorable.

Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint.

I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.

We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.

We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.

I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.

Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.

All right, you win.

The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.

Na-a-ah! 

And your favorite lemon bars.

Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.

We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.

Let's all be atheists!

Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.

Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! 

We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.

Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? 

Stephen, you did what??

Oh God, Mark! Help! 

I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. 

Excuse me, I didn't catch that.

Oh God...  No! 

Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?

You made a goofy face!

Way to go, champ.

OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
Cartman:
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.  Eh. 

Just go away and let me die! 

Don't forget: your lies started all this. 

Why, sweetie? What's the matter?

There's no way my son's going.

I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!

I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! 

He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!

So what happens now?

Oh, my baby's back!

It isn't right! Make it go away!

Mark, I'm scared!

Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.

Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!

No, no wait, there's still a box over here.

Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?

What's that?

Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?

Rrrmm-mmrrhh!

You are grounded, mister!

Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door. 

Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!

Hi everyone.

You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.

Oh, poor Butters!

Really?

Stephen! Stephen, come quick! It's butters!  Look!

What do you think, Doctor?

He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... 

Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.

Oh my God!

Hello Token. How was school today?

That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.

Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters. 

Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.

Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.

Mark, I don't like this.

You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?

Chris, is she serious?

He's not?

He was supposed to stay dead!

Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.

Gaah!

That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?

Oh God! Are you blind?!

You sure are.

Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS 

No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.

To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.

We're sorry, baby. 

Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?

I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.

Randy, what are you doing?

Hey, I think you'd make a great father.

What on earth is the matter with him?

Butters! 

What, what brand are they?

No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.

You don't use Handicar?

Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! 

Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?

OHHHH MY GOD!!

My God! Mark!  What is it??

Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?

Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!

What are we becoming?!

Oh my God, our house!

He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.

Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.

But he's our son!

No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs.

Butters, what have you done to your hair? 

Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?

Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!

Keep the door locked.

Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?

Mark, I'm scared. 

Closing it down? They can't do that.

Dead people?

But what about before that?

Now he thinks he's a truck driver. 

Mark? Mark, look.  Well, hello. What's your name?  What- what do you want?

You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!

What?

He must be parkiing someone else's car.

It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.

Butters?  Butters!

There! There, you see it?

...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!

We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.

Is that bad?

Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.

Mmrrhhhh!

You don't know that, Stephen!

It's... hungry.

You... have a girlfriend, Butters?

Thank goodness.

What on Earth?

Wait a minute. What was the movie called?

All right!

Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!

Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!

And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.

What are you spending all that money on, Butters?

NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!

Yes! It just ran across the floor!

Our darling Butters never came home last night.

Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.

Butters?? Oh, Butters!

What is it, Stephen?

Stephen, what has happened to our boy?

Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.

Yes. The basement.

You have to let them in, Randy.

Steven, what do we do?

You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!

YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! "(Punch)"

Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.

If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? 

Stay away from me, bastard!

There is no going back, Chris!

With you where?

And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.

Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?

Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?

Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?

And I got my tubes tied.

To the gym?

You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
