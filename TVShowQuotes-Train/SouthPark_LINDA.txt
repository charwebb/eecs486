YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! "(Punch)"

To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.

No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.

Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!

Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.

"Dear bastard husband," No.  "Dear lying sonofabitch," No.  "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-"

If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? 

Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? 

Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.

Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? 

And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?

We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.

Our darling Butters never came home last night.

What on earth is the matter with him?

I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.

We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.

Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!

Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?  You are grounded, mister!

Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.

Butters, what have you done to your hair? 

...Don't you make that face at me, young man!

Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.

... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.

Mark? Mark, look.  Well, hello. What's your name?  What- what do you want?

Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! 

Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.

Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! 

Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!

You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?

Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?

You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!

Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!

How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?

OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
Cartman:
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.  Eh. 

What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!

Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!

Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. 

Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.

Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.

Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?

If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.

Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!

It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.

I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.

He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... 

No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive.

I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!

Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.

NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!

We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.

I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!

We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.

And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.

Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?

You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!

A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.

Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.

You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!

Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?

Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!

Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!

Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?

Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.

Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?

This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.

Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. 

I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.

Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.

Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!

Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.

Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.

What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??

Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.

The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.

...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!

He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.

I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.

What are you spending all that money on, Butters?

Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.

Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! 

No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.

Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?

The rest of the f- you do mean us?

No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.

Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS 

Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! 

Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?

And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.

No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs.

Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.

I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 

I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!  Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- 

Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? 

Hey, I think you'd make a great father.

You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.

And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.

Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?

Wait a minute. What was the movie called?

Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door. 

Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?

Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!

No, no wait, there's still a box over here.

We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.

Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.

Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?

Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!

Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!

Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.

Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.

That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.

I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! 

I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. 

Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.

Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.

Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.

Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.

It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?

Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?

This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!

I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.

Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? 

Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? 

Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?
