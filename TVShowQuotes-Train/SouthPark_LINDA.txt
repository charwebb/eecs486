No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? 
Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?
You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.
Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!
And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.
Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.
The rest of the f- you do mean us?
Our darling Butters never came home last night.
Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?
I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.
You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!
Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?
I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.
Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!
No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.
Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. 
Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? 
And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?
We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!
Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.
You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs.
Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.
I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!  Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- 
We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.
Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?
We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.
If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? 
The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.
Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.
Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.
Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!
Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?  You are grounded, mister!
I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!
Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS 
Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! 
Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.
Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.
Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe.  I just love the cute little canarian on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. 
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? 
Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!
Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? 
Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! "(Punch)"
To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.
Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?
It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?
Mark? Mark, look.  Well, hello. What's your name?  What- what do you want?
This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
Hey, I think you'd make a great father.
Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!
He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... 
I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.
No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.
Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!
You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.
Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.
I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. 
And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.
Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?
We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! 
How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door. 
Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?
I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.
Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.
He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.
Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.
Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! 
Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.
What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!
"Dear bastard husband," No.  "Dear lying sonofabitch," No.  "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-"
Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?
I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! 
Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.
Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.
Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? 
Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?
Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?
I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!
What are you spending all that money on, Butters?
Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!
Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.
No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.
I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 
A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.
Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.
Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.
Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
Butters, what have you done to your hair? 
What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??
And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.
... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.
If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.
Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?
Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? 
We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!
What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!
OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
Cartman:
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.  Eh. 
Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.
Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.
Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! 
Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.
...Don't you make that face at me, young man!
Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.
Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.
