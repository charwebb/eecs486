What?

Butters?  Butters!

Yes, I... remember hearing something about that.

The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.

Don't forget: your lies started all this. 

Aw, that's just adorable.

We're sorry, baby. 

A what?

Hey, I think you'd make a great father.

I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!

No,  I didn't hear about that.

You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?

Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.

Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.

He was supposed to stay dead!

Butters, what happened to your eye?

We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!

Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! 

Yes! It just ran across the floor!

There! There, you see it?

Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.

I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.

Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?

And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?

Your T.M.I.?

Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.

This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!

What?

I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!

Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?

Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!

Now he thinks he's a truck driver. 

You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!

Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.

It isn't right! Make it go away!

A penis is loose in our kitchen!

Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.

Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.

What do you think, Doctor?

Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.

Mark, I'm scared. 

Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.

But he's our son!

He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!

No!  Our son is dead!

Oh, my baby's back!

How much? For Butters?

Huh?

What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!

Oh my God, Butters!

Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. 

Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!

I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!

You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.

Anything, Stephen?

... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.

Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?

This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.

Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS 

Ohh Godd!! 

You don't know anything!

OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
Cartman:
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.  Eh. 

Mark, I don't like this.

And your favorite lemon bars.

Gaah!

Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.

Butters? Butters?!

No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive.

Mmrrhhhh!

Uh, uh...

It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?

Score one for us atheists

You have to let them in, Randy.

Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? 

No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.

Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?  You are grounded, mister!

We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.

I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.

You don't know that, Stephen!

Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!

Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!

Online

Mark? Mark, look.  Well, hello. What's your name?  What- what do you want?

Dead people?

I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.

Oh no. NO!  Aaaah! 

Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?

Our darling Butters never came home last night.

I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! 

Randy, what are you doing?

No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? 

Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint.

Hmmm...

Oh my God...

Butters?? Oh, Butters!

No! No!

Is that bad?

And I got my tubes tied.

Goodnight, baby. 

Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.

Why, sweetie? What's the matter?

Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.

YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! "(Punch)"

NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!!

Oh. Sure.

I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.

Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!

Oh my God!

Oh, you!

Yes. The basement.

The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.

Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?

Yes!!

Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.

I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. 

Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? 

Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.

Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe.  I just love the cute little canarian on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. 

How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?

Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!

...Don't you make that face at me, young man!

NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!

Oh God! Are you blind?!

Mark, are we doing the right thing?

...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!

I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.

Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?

Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! 

Butters, why?? Oh my God!

Thank goodness.

Oh God...  No! 

Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?

No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.

He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.

Hi everyone.

Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? 

Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.

What, what brand are they?

What?!

Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.

A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.

What is that? Chris, what is that?

What are you spending all that money on, Butters?

Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.

Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?

Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?

But what about before that?

That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.

Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age!

Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? 

And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.

I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 

Butters, time for bed.

Here we go. 

Then we can go with him.

The rest of the f- you do mean us?

Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.

What on Earth?

Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.

Okay. 

What?

Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!

And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.

Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door. 

Keep the door locked.

Butters! 

Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!

What's going on, you two?

He must be parkiing someone else's car.

What on earth is the matter with him?

Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters. 

Wait a minute. What was the movie called?

Oh, poor Butters!

Closing it down? They can't do that.

Oh my God, our house!

Stephen!

To the gym?

Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. 

Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.

Then why, Chris, why?!

What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!

Really?

Mark, I'm scared!

Mark!

We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.

We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.

Butters, you have some visitors. 

Just go away and let me die! 

Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? 

Stephen, what is this place?

Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.

No, no wait, there's still a box over here.

Stephen, what has happened to our boy?

Chris, is she serious?

You don't use Handicar?

Let's all be atheists!

Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! 

Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! 

Butters?  Butters?! 

Oh, Chris. 

Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!

I have to do it, Steven.

Stephen, you did what??

Bye, sweetie, we love you!

Oh no.  NO!

Good morning, Butters.

Rrrmm-mmrrhh!

Oh Butters!

"Dear bastard husband," No.  "Dear lying sonofabitch," No.  "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-"

There is no going back, Chris!

Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.

Butters, put your clothes on.

We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.

Butters, what are you doing?

We aren't honestly considering this?

No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs.

Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?

Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.

It's... hungry.

I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.

Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.

You are grounded, mister!

I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. 

Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.

You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!

Stephen! Stephen, come quick! It's butters!  Look!

What's that?

Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.

Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!

Stay away from me, bastard!

All right!

Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!

Stop it!

You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!

You sure are.

Hi Butters.

Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?

We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.

Butters, what on earth are you doing??

To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.

Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.

OHHHH MY GOD!!

He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... 

Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!

Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.

I'm your engineer.

What is it?! Acid?!

Hello Token. How was school today?

And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.

There's no way my son's going.

Why not?

Na-a-ah! 

Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?

He's not?

What are we becoming?!

It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.

So what happens now?

Hey, kids.

If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.

Friends, by default.
