Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome? 
A little girl is making big waves with her fight against Photoshop.
Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?
What say you and me... go to T.G.I. Fridays?
No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken.
Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality.
Whoooooo!  Aaah-oww!  You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!
Oh, my God. It's that tingling again.  I love you! 
They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!
That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise.
Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here.
We don't go to work for another hour.
Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!
You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control.  And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's,  and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken? 
Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring.
Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
