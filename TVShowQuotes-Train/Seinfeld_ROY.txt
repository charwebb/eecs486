She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.
(quietly- yeah) After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for weeks.
Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi.
So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? (takes a big mouthful of spaghetti)
I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.
You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what'cha did for me.
Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.
Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall) Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?
Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you.
Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.
