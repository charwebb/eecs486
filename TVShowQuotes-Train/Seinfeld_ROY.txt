Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.
Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall) Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?
Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi.
So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? (takes a big mouthful of spaghetti)
(quietly- yeah) After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for weeks.
I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.
Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you.
You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what'cha did for me.
Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.
Heeyy - there's the guy who saved my life. (points at the doctor.)
