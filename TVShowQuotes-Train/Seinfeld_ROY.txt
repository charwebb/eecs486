Sorry about that.
Are you mad at me now?
Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
You're all gay.
Nope.
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
Yeah, you too. Should be fun.
Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
Wow.
[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
[looks around conference room] You're joking right?
Okay.
Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.
Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]
I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
Yeah? Let's get you into a tub.
Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
Thanks...aw.
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
Come on, you mad at me?
[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
Like next to no benefits.
Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
Crazy day, huh?
One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
Sorry, babe. I am just beat.
We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.
Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you...
Come on.
I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
No.
Come on [begins to tickle Pam]
No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.
So how's your day going?
Ah, thank you!
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
[laughs] Congrats, man.
I can't for your art show tonight.
Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.
How's that union stuff coming?
Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning.
Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
Hey, baby.
No problem.
[Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
Yeah, let's get out of here.
Jet ski money?
But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.
So I only use three?
That's her?
You look like you feel bad.
Hey, they're playing our song.
Where did you go to school?
All right.
Hey.
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?'
Oh, cool.
What's up?
What?
Absolutely.
You said it was important, so... How's it going?
Hey, hey, hey.
[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?
Hey, um, I was wondering if it'd be ok if I go to Lonny's poker game tonight.  I promise, it'll be like the last time for a while.
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
Yeah?  Sure is small.  Got airbags?
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
That's what I'm talking about.
In my truck.
What does that mean?
I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.
Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
Should have done it a long time ago.
Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
Sure.
No, it was Captain Jack.
Little package!
Sweet.
Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?
Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
OK.
Why?
Ok.
Are they going to call the cops?
Yeah? Get you a drink.
You look good.
I was just kidding.  You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
Sweet. All right.
What, you're mad at me?
He's in the office.
Hey babe.  Hey, how are you!?
Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.
That's what I'm talking about.
This is awesome.
Come on.
So Pam's happy?
Never.
What?
[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.
[laughs] Cool, all right.
At the party?
I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
Hey there.
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
To my place?
So, we're cool, right?
Engaged, yeah.
I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.
All right, let's go.
Are you still mad at me?
Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
You look great!
Yeah.
Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
Pam. Go.
What are you gay?
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
[to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
How are you likin' the new car?
You don't know?
It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
What's going on with Pam?
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
She took you down, huh?
[laughing] I think he's dancing.
All right, I'll see ya.
No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
[points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].
I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art.
Yeah?
Hey, what's up, guys? How you been?
Hey Darryl, what's happenin'?
Alright, bye. [Pam looks around the office]
I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
Why don't you get on that?
It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
Oh, no. That is not worth it.
I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
Hey! Guys, what's going on?
That's disgusting.
What's the problem?
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
Don't yell?!
No!
Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
Hey baby.
No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding.
On this side.
I don't understand.
Natural redhead.
I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
I'm not gonna hit you or anything.
Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.
Love ya.
Jim came on to you?
Hey Halpert!
What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
...talking about? He's a jackass every year.
You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
Yeah.
Yeah!
What? Iverson's not fat.
Are you still mad at me now?
If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
Chicken or fish?
What the hell man?
No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.
What's wrong?
It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
I can read you like a book.
So you havin' a good day?
Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
I'm good.
You ready?
Hey babe.
See you.
Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you.
Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
Are you kidding?
You look good.
[walking into the break room] Hey.
Exactly.
You think you can beat up Darryl?
[as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.
I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
[on video] Yes.
Hey.
I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
No, you take it easy.
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
You almost ready to go?
Yeah! That's great.
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best!
So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]
Yes, I have. [kisses Pam]
I thought you were a friend.
Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.
Halpert?
You can't keep anything from me.
Boys R Us!
You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.
Really?
OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
