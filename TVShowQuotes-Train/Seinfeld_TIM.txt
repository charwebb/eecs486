Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?
(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)
Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.
I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?
Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)
Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
So, I guess I'll see you at the game.
Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.
Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
And you really don't look like a Murphy.
I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)
Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.
And of course, his great book, "The Game".
Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)
I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
