I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
So, I guess I'll see you at the game.
Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
(Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)
5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.
I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)
Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?
And of course, his great book, "The Game".
Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)
And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)
And you really don't look like a Murphy.
Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?
Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.
No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)
Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.
You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
