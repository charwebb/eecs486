No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)
No, it's no problem, what is it?
Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
What, are you kidding?
Really glad you came.
Uh, ok.
Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
Elaine! Hi!
(Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh?
Hey! Happy Chanukah!
It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.
You think someone's been tipped off?
And of course, his great book, "The Game".
Mazel Tov.
I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
And you really don't look like a Murphy.
It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
That's John Voight's pencil?
You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
Thanks.
Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?
Oh, Elaine!
Jerry.
(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)
You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.
We'll be ready in a minute.
Hey, Jerry.
Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?
5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
Sounds more like Scottish.
Uh, no.
I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
Oh yeah, me too.
Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
You are.
Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.
Well. I'm really glad you came.
Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?
This was fun, you know?
Hey Jerry?
Why? You bringing someone else?
Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)
So, I guess I'll see you at the game.
You are.
Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?
Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
But you gave it to me.
What's up?
(pulling out a gun) Alright, get down!
Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.
I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?
And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
Um...
Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)
Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
I'm sorry.
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.
Oh? What's that?
So, I'll call.
How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
Those aren't mahtzah balls.
Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)
