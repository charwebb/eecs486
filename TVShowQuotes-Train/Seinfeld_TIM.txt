Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?
And of course, his great book, "The Game".
You think someone's been tipped off?
No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?
Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
You are.
Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.
That's John Voight's pencil?
So, I'll call.
What, are you kidding?
Why? You bringing someone else?
Uh, ok.
Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)
Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
Jerry.
What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
Elaine! Hi!
Right downtown.
And you really don't look like a Murphy.
(startled) Elaine, hi.
It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.
Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?
Oh, the Ambassador.
You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.
You are.
It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)
Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.
Thanks.
No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)
You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
(Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh?
Oh, Elaine!
This was fun, you know?
Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.
Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
(pulling out a gun) Alright, get down!
Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)
(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
Those aren't mahtzah balls.
Well, this is my building.
Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
What's up?
Really glad you came.
But you gave it to me.
Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.
All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?
We'll be ready in a minute.
Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
No, it's no problem, what is it?
Where are you from?
How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
So, I guess I'll see you at the game.
Uh, no.
(Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)
Oh? What's that?
Hey Jerry?
Sounds more like Scottish.
Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)
I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
Oh yeah, me too.
