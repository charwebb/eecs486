(startled) Elaine, hi.
What, are you kidding?
Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.
No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?
I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
So, I'll call.
And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
Oh, the Ambassador.
Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
Why? You bringing someone else?
That's John Voight's pencil?
No, it's no problem, what is it?
But you gave it to me.
Well. I'm really glad you came.
Hey, Jerry.
I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
Um...
Those aren't mahtzah balls.
You are.
Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
(pulling out a gun) Alright, get down!
This was fun, you know?
Jerry.
What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
Oh? What's that?
Thanks.
All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?
Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.
Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.
You are.
Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
Uh, ok.
Well, this is my building.
Right downtown.
And of course, his great book, "The Game".
Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.
(Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)
I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
I'm sorry.
Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
Where are you from?
I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)
And you really don't look like a Murphy.
You think someone's been tipped off?
Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.
Hey! Happy Chanukah!
(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
Oh yeah, me too.
Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.
Elaine! Hi!
Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?
Oh, Elaine!
Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)
Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)
Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
Hey Jerry?
Mazel Tov.
Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?
Sounds more like Scottish.
No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)
You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
What's up?
We'll be ready in a minute.
