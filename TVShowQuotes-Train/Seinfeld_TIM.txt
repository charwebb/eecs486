No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?
Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?
Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.
(Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)
Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)
(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)
Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?
And you really don't look like a Murphy.
It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)
Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.
I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)
Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
So, I guess I'll see you at the game.
I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.
Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
And of course, his great book, "The Game".
Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
