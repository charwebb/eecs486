I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)
You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.
Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)
It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)
Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?
Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?
I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)
Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.
Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.
And of course, his great book, "The Game".
Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)
Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
So, I guess I'll see you at the game.
(Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)
I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?
I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
