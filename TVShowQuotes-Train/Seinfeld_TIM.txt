Well, this is my building.
What's up?
Where are you from?
Uh, ok.
Mazel Tov.
I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
Why? You bringing someone else?
We'll be ready in a minute.
All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?
Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?
(startled) Elaine, hi.
You think someone's been tipped off?
Jerry.
Oh, Elaine!
This was fun, you know?
Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
But you gave it to me.
Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)
Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
What, are you kidding?
Thanks.
Sounds more like Scottish.
Hey, Jerry.
Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
You are.
You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.
(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
That's John Voight's pencil?
(Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh?
Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
Oh? What's that?
Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
Hey! Happy Chanukah!
Well. I'm really glad you came.
I'm sorry.
No, it's no problem, what is it?
Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
Hey Jerry?
So, I'll call.
You are.
Right downtown.
Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)
How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)
Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
Um...
Oh yeah, me too.
And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
Those aren't mahtzah balls.
Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
(pulling out a gun) Alright, get down!
Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
And of course, his great book, "The Game".
No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)
It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.
So, I guess I'll see you at the game.
Uh, no.
Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)
What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
And you really don't look like a Murphy.
Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.
Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.
You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.
