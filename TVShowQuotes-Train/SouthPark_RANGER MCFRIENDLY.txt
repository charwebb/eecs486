Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!
How long do we have until the smug clouds collide?
All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!
You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!
If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes. 
You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!
Soo, that's it people.  When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen.
Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town.
We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!
Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!
