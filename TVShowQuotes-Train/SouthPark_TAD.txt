Looks like you think you're a pretty good skier, huh, kid?
This is a song I wrote about... Stan Marsh. Staaaaan... Daaaaarsh...Stan. Darsh. Darshy DaaarshStan DaaarshStan Darsh, Stan-darshStan Daaaaarsh DaaarshStan Darsh...
This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!
I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean. 
I've been skiing for twenty-two years. Think you could beat me?
Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?
Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh! 
OooooOOOOooo!  Looks to me like you're not a "hot shot" after all.
Stan Marsh  Stan DARSH is more like it.
Alright, fine. You and me at the summit, now!
Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow.
Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13. 
well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh!
Alright, how about a race, then? You and me.
You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll always be number two!  See ya later, Darsh! 
Hey everyone.  I'd like to sing a little song, if I may.
Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race!
Haha.  This should slow down Darsh a bit!
