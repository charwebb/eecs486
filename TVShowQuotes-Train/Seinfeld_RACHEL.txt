Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.
Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.
You're right, I would have.
Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
We don't have any gum.
Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
Hi.
What'd you want anyway, George?
It's been soo long.
I'm gonna take a swim.
(sighs) Jerry ...
When are they leaving?
(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)
Why not?
Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
No.
I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
So where is this baby, anyway?
Hey!
Good morning.
Ok, it's only two more days.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Oh, Kramer! You startled me.
I suppose...
Don't you knock?
Strange man.
(going out the door) It's night meeting you.
Mm-hmm.
Yea.
There's lobster in these eggs?
Yes, I do. Thank you.
(confused) What?
Come on, Kramer.
Definitely
Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
Yeah, you too.
Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
You will?
