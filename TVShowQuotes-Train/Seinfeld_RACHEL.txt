No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.
So where is this baby, anyway?
Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
Good morning.
There's lobster in these eggs?
I'm gonna take a swim.
Huh?
When are they leaving?
Yeah, what's the big deal?
You will?
I suppose...
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)
(going out the door) It's night meeting you.
Hi.
Umm... This is so good.
Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
What'd you want anyway, George?
Mm-hmm.
We don't have any gum.
C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.
(sighs) Jerry ...
It's been soo long.
Oh, Kramer! You startled me.
Don't you knock?
I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
(Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
Yeah, you too.
Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
Come on, Kramer.
Yea.
Hey!
Definitely
Yes, I do. Thank you.
Ok, it's only two more days.
Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
(confused) What?
Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
