You're right, I would have.
What'd you want anyway, George?
Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
No.
Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
Yeah, you too.
There's lobster in these eggs?
I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
Yes, I do. Thank you.
Huh?
Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
Definitely
(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)
Why not?
Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
Hi.
(going out the door) It's night meeting you.
Oh, Kramer! You startled me.
I suppose...
Umm... This is so good.
Don't you knock?
No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.
When are they leaving?
Hey!
So where is this baby, anyway?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
You will?
(confused) What?
Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
Good morning.
Ok, it's only two more days.
(sighs) Jerry ...
It's been soo long.
Strange man.
Mm-hmm.
C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.
I'm gonna take a swim.
We don't have any gum.
