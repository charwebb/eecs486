I'm gonna take a swim.
Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
Good morning.
Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
We don't have any gum.
I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
Why not?
Don't you knock?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Yeah, you too.
I suppose...
Huh?
No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.
(confused) What?
There's lobster in these eggs?
Definitely
Hi.
(sighs) Jerry ...
What'd you want anyway, George?
Mm-hmm.
Umm... This is so good.
C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.
Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
Oh, Kramer! You startled me.
When are they leaving?
(Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
You will?
Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
Strange man.
So where is this baby, anyway?
(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)
Come on, Kramer.
Hey!
Yea.
It's been soo long.
Yeah, what's the big deal?
Yes, I do. Thank you.
Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
Ok, it's only two more days.
(going out the door) It's night meeting you.
