No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.
Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.
(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)
Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
(Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
