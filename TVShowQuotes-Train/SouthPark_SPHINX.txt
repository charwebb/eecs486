Call those boys' mothers.  I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.
Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know. 
Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite. 
We already know you know him. We have this!  Now, who is he?! 
Relax, boys. We just need to talk with you.
Hello there, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here. 
We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology.
Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food.
We're here to speak with some of your students.  You , you , you , and you .
Cool? That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?!
But they're just kids. We can't torture them.
Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship?
