We already know you know him. We have this!  Now, who is he?! 
Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship?
But they're just kids. We can't torture them.
Relax, boys. We just need to talk with you.
We are the CIA. That ship needs to be with us! Maybe we should just take something precious of yours, huh?!  Daha!  This! This gourd-thingy, for instance. How do you like that, huh? If you ever wanna see this... little... thingy again, I suggest you contact your boy! 
We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology.
Call those boys' mothers.  I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.
We're here to speak with some of your students.  You , you , you , and you .
Cool? That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?!
Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food.
Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite. 
Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know.
