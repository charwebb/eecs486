News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
I don't know why I write my name on things.
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You said you would be there for me.
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
Please just take my name off of everything.
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
I think I'd like to go home now.
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
What? Why did you call me out here?
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
He put you right in front of me?
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
I don't understand what you want from me.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
But I don't see how this is my problem.
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
What am I supposed to do with this?
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
But we don't keep two sets of books.
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
How could you do that without telling me?
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
Will you help me put it over there?
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
I think the senator is having an affair.
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
I have to go clean up after the party.
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
I think you have me confused with another person.
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Can���t I just agree without putting my hand in?
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
You're not going to get my permission on this.
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
I made a vow. I gave my word.
This is how you make this important decision?
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
I knew it. You should see their baby.
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
... doing the work that could be done by two.
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
How can she make you get back together with her?
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
