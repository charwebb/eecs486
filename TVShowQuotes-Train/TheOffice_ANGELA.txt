People red vine.
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
Okay.
Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
I can't do this.
Yeah.
Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
It's fake.
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
Dwight! That doesn't count!
Those aren't chips and dip.
And I made cookies. Same category.
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
Good.
Dwight, you should be running this office.
[on phone] It was an unfortunate error.
So you fell in?
None of them. Especially not Andy.
[walks around Andy's new car keying it]
So you keep a very tidy house.
Do not panic.
Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
No, Kevin, no.
Pam, we have a great idea.
Please don���t teach the cat French.
Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.
I can play.
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
Pull me up!
His hair's flipping out on the sides.
Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
Okay, watch it.
If you know something Michael...
This is a cold pack...
Paid.
It'll be fun.
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
I'm sure Dwight will protect him.
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
I think I'd like to go home now.
You're gonna wait here?
Phyllis. You're a married woman.
The party starts in an hour.
It's not an office expense.
Enough Oscar, enough.
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
[gags]
No you go. Hi honey!
I called you morons.
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Bye.
I knew it. You should see their baby.
This is just offensive.
Andy, what are you doing?
That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.
These are for employees only.
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
Can I go back to my desk now?
No Dwight!
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
Her name was Sprinkles.
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
Chocolates?  Someone famous?
Hey!
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
Dwight.
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
Yes.
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
Yeah, it is, Andy.
Right.
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
Deep fried Twinkies?  It's gross!
Hi.
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
I would like cat.
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
I made a vow. I gave my word.
I think Andy makes an excellent point.
No, I didn't.
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
No thank you.
What a surprise.
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
[walks away]
No, not the senator. I love Dwight.
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
It would never work here.
Wait, what is this?
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
D?
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
Why'd you stop it?
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
[to Kevin] Language.
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
I don't.
Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
No, Dwight!
Cool music.
Oh.
Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
Alright, I think I'm trained.
Oscar.
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
Why don���t you pack it?
Rude.
Dwight, that's awful.
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
There's no fizz in this punch. Phyllis!
[Spits champagne back into her glass]
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
Something like that.
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
Lacrosse, the sport?
Yes, it was.
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
Well then. Have a nice day.
You're in my way!
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
No, it doesn't!
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
You'll see me in small claims court!
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
You don���t want me at your place.
Did you bring your jerky in again?
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
Seven, two...
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
I don't know.
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
You're not going to get my permission on this.
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
Do you think he's signed them yet?
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
Probably.
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
Don't encourage him, Dwight.
You don't understand.
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
No.
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
Phillip���s your son.
Thank you.
Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
The DaVinci Code!
No.
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
No, it wasn���t.
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
Thank you. [both laugh]
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
I don't--
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
So, what happened?
Did he not tell you that?
Another clue, another clue.
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Thanks.
That's not happening.
You need a hair cut.
What if it's a girl?
Black widow.
Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
Thank you. [sniffles]
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
That's never the case.
How long does it take to get the results?
This is my big sister Rachel.
Michael, do something.
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
No, you will not.
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
My name is Angela.
Oh. [hands Pam tape]
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
Yeah.
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
But it's the season of mercy.
Yes, he is.
Fine! It���s Oscar. So what?
Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
Whack.
Everything.
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!
You gave birth in a tub?
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
Yes, yes. He's sleeping.
... that has three people...
Dwight?
I work with Dwight.
Kevin, Kevin.
You can't go in yet!
That is completely untrue.
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
How could you do that without telling me?
This is a big day for you.
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
Yes it does!
... doing the work that could be done by two.
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Not here.
[coughs for attention]
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
What?
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
Nine, eight, five...
[whispering]
Oh my god!
It's supposed to say launch!
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
They arrived this morning.
Ok, you go to the store.
I would watch that.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
Why wouldn't we come?
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
But--
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
I shredded it.
With who?
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
That's... no...
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
What do you want?
Spray her down?
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Oscar.
No.
I don't think that this is---
It's OK.
I know.
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
No, stop! Just don't.
Fifty.
It's nothing.
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
Zip it, Meredith.
Take this thing. [takes off twine ring]
Dwight!
You're safety partners!
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
Those aren't helpful.
Mmhmm.
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
What have you heard?
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
Okay���
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
It's ok.
Dwight?
Amen.
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
Your hand's in it.
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
I didn't apologize.
Come on, right now.
No.
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
I find this incredibly offensive.
I won't be watching, and I won't.
No. You know-no!
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
Why?
Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
No Dwight, I won't- [hoses Dwight]
What? Why did you call me out here?
Where's my car? Come on.
And what...
Please.
Hmm, I liked it.
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
[Michael tries to hug Angela] No, no.
You don't know them all?
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
I understand.
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
I'm sorry... that you're both morons.
Do you have a gun?
No.
I will not.
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Ugh.
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
This looks like a hoot.
Really? [to Dwight] Thank you.
Hello Aunt Shirley.
No.
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
What?
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
No! Stop it!
Apparently.
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
But, it...
Ohhhh!
I did not. Uh-uh.
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
Mmm-hmm.
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
Oh. Thanks.
Kevin, could you not do that?
Michael wrote down 'Astird.'
Elevators.
What am I supposed to do with this?
No.
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
1434-967, paid.
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
What are you doing?
You could out-sell Michael any day.
Let me know.
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
I do not wanna talk about this.
What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
You���re a dad!
Dwight!
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
Shut up.
You're bad at this too!
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
Dwight.
What about the surprise?
[approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!
How thoughtful.
Excuse me?
Did you guys figure it out?
That town is full of history!
Meredith, too far!
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
Thank you.
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
Pam, my bag was there...
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
What is this?
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
Aw, preemie pajamas!
No.
Nothing. Should be fun.
Amen.
It was all my fault.
No, not at all.
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
No.  Are we supposed to?
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
Agreed.
You're useless.
Really, Pam...
All right!
What is this?
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
[ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
Yeah, neither did I.
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
No, it's ah...
Why?
Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?
What?
[starts sobbing] I love him.
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
Uh-uh, leave us alone.
Don't Meredith.
I don���t���I don���t know why.
Come on, you're safety partners!
It sounds mean.
Okay.
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
That doesn't sound like me.
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
I hate beet salad.
Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
Yes.
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Andy?
Kevin! That's inappropriate.
No, he���s fine.
What color do you guys think?
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
Come here, come here. Let's go.
Oh my God.
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
Sales take a long time.
Ow!
He's not weird, he's just individualistic.
It's really happening!
Hi, Dwight.
We can save that.
[sighs] All right!
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
Michael!
Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
Well, it better work.
No thank you.
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
What���s going on?
He���s here.
[shaking head in disbelief] No.
I was.
Hmm.
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
What do you hear?
Honey! What are you doing here?
Stop it.
This is not work talk.
No, no!
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
Where is it?
...Okay.
I think you've had enough.
Extension 128.
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
Judges and juries!
Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.
I tried. We didn't have time.
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
No.
Mm-hmm.
This is my favorite day.
Maybe.
Great.[Angela walks away]
Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
Do you have any pastries without fruit?
Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.'
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
It's ridiculous.
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
It's beautiful.
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
Alright.
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
I'm his! His... wife.
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head]
Thank you, Michael.
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
...but it's totally inappropriate.
No!
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
But he's an idiot!
Oh, god.
Call him! Call him!
Yeah!
I didn't ask you to scratch it.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
Put your hands in your pockets.
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
It does!
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
Mmhm.
Really? Well, I hope I do.
I don't like my character.
Andy, is this you?
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Okay.
Goodbye.
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
Great, then it doesn't matter.
Is it called red-vining?
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
The glitter is blinding.
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
[removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!
Murder.
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Sure.
I have to hang these.
What are you...?
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
[sobbing]
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
Stop it!
Uh-huh.
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
What is that?
It's hard.
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
Can you put that down there?
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
I've seen some of your spreadsheets.
Good night, D.
What?
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
It's after my cat.
I'm the head accountant.
Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
We are not married.
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
Yes.
yes!
Ugh!
Stop it.
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
And where do you think you're going?
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
[meows like a cat, then hisses]
I, barely know him...
Hmm.
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
Right?
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
Such a precious little angel.
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
It's the nativity scene.
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
Okay.
He���s always been like that.
Why are you doing this to Andy?
[sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God!
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
What are you doing here?
Thank you.
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Gah.
No.
And I lied to you.
Well, for our profit...
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
Are you married?
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
Yeah. And I said sorry.
Now. Come on, up here!
Sometimes you talk to us real close.
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
Two, one...
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
Oh, really?
No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
Yes.
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
Yes.
My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
Sprinkles.
Mm-Hmm.
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
You embarrassed me earlier.
No.
Last week.
You know what Pam just save it.
No.
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
I got sap on me.
That's Phyllis.
Yes.
Dwight!
Do not panic!
Ow!
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
Jedediah.
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
Well, this is intimate.
Little Cici asleep?
Charity.  Bake drive.
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
Ugh.
Nothing for me?
Let���s go Kelly.
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
In your nose?
Spring cleaning?
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
Andy.
A nun?
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
Have a great day.
I don't care, but yes.
What!?
My Phillip is crawling.
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
No.
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
Ow! Dwight! Ow!
Kelly's training us?
Hi.
Yes.
I didn't-
That is where we disagree.
I said nothing fancy.
Come on!
I wouldn't put it past her.
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
Kevin, come.
He put you right in front of me?
You don���t carry it with you?
Kevin!
You won't see-
Black eye, Meredith.
I don't like it. [Angela leaves]
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
God!
[flustered] Goodness.
They're Sugarplum fairy wands.
Kevin, come.
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
No, orange is whorish.
I have one, yes.
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
What are you doing?
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
I didn't get mine yet.
What if they deserved it?
I already did.
Sign.
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
The Bible.
Obviously.
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!
The senator.
Phyllis?
Yes, What are you doing here?
Why isn't Jim wet?
We'll see.
Dwight!
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
Are we out of jobs?
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
Of course.
Oh.
What?
Pay him whatever he wants.
The senator will be joining us later.
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
Kevin, what's four plus seven?
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
Yes.
So a child had fallen in?
Oh, no.
And person.
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]
Hi.
All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
Six-seventy, six-twenty.
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
No she shouldn't.
Please stop making me do these things.
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
No one said 'you must have two'
It's an experiment.
Don't just say things.
Please, after the turtle?
You're ahead.
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
I'm not voting.
Yes it is.
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
[sighs] Yes, that's true.
Can you put that down?
Is it cool in here to you?
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
I'll help you!
We can make a difference here.
We're in the pool!
He's out sick.
Yes. And he didn���t like it.
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
Oh, Dwight, just move.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
You said you would be there for me.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
Meaning what?
Do they even have a bakery anymore?
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
Sign.
It's outside.
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
[sees Kevin's toupee] Oh my God.
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
I look forward to it.
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Perfect!
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
Wha? Who gave you that advice?
Ugh.
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
Jedediah.
Oh, my Lord.
Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?
That didn't happen.
Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
In a general sense.
What?
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
[cutting in] No! Don't!
Whoo!
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl?
Thanks.
What is this?
[shakes her head disapprovingly]
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
Well, it does.  That's me.
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
Waste of time.
No, I don���t��� no.
Okay.
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
What about my cherub figurine?
This is from Hooters.
Wha -
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
Thank you.
OK, it's three forty eight.
Mmm hmmm.
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
What is that?  What is that?
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
Shh.
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
What?
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
You shouldn't joke about that.
I don't understand what you want from me.
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
Did Toby approve this?
Kevin?
No. This is a closed door meeting.
I don't think that...
God!
Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
It's fabric! I really wanted this.
I could see enjoying that.
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
Are you allowed to have pets?
You already did me.
No.
Just a few quick things.
Thank you.
Really?
Can you arrange a meeting?
I heard you. [quickly walks away]
Mm-hm.
But...
He's just trying to push your buttons.
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
Dwight?
Yes.
I'm so glad you could come.
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
Ew.
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
[nods]
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
The guys?
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
Michael...
I have some ideas about conservation...
Very much. How's your meat?
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
But I don't understand. It's for managers.
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
Kevin, where are you going?
[upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh!
What? What is it?
No. No.
In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
Oh God!
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
Let's do it.
Phillip?
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
You saw it?  Describe it please.
Ow! What are you doing?
What are you talking about Michael?
Is it any good?
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
Oh!
Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
How many gods do you have?
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
You
Are you sure?
No, Dwight. The Senator.
Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.
You never told us to close them.
I love you.
What is it?
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
No, it's an invitation.
Are you authorized to do this?
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
Ah!
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
What?
I knew it!
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
Guh.
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
Okay, bye.
Yes.
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
Really?
That doesn't surprise me.
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
[walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen.
Fine.
Same page. Go to the next one.
No thank you, Roy.
Hey.
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
What does that mean?
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
I think green is kind of whoreish.
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
[laughing] It's a man eating cat food.
How is that a bad rumor?
I can't be your monkey, Dwight.
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
Yeah.
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
So what are your credentials?
Ahh! Dwight!
He's hungry.
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
Nothing, Kevin.
I don't take any prescription drugs.
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Where's Dwight?
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
No.
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
Oscar.
Well���
You put her in my freezer.
I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
Bye!
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal.
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
That's why you're not in charge Meredith.
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot]
Watching some of your friends.
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
You're expanding on your worst idea.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
I can't, Sprinkles is sick.
Thank you.
What?
No, I meant... [motions you and me]
We will discuss this later.
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
I'm a vegetarian.
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
Good luck, Dwight.
[sighs]
Is this spicy?
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
God!
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
Have you taken any concrete steps?
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Who drives like that?
There should be some ..
How can she make you get back together with her?
Good.
Okay.
Congratulations Dwight.
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
Yes?
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
I do like it, actually.
No.
That's why we're cursed.
Come on, Dwight.
Charles, where were you born?
Is that really necessary?
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
Yes.
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
No, that���s not���
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
Completely unacceptable.
Heh.
Uh-huh.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
[gasps]
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
Yes. Congratulations.
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
[Dwight slaps her butt] Hey!
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
Mmhmm.
Why?
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
What?
Then roll an eight.
I wrote it out.
Yeah, uh no.
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
Confetti.
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
[quickly] Amen.
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
Never.
Thank you.
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
Good night, Dwight.
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
Shut up.
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
Uh!
It���s too loud.
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
There's still an hour.
No.
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
Goodie.
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
Something made of ice?
[disbelieving] Really?
People are dressed inappropriately.
He's just....
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
Decent people everywhere will get offended.
Dwight?
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
Seven thousand dollars.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Come on!
No!
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
Mm-hmm.
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
Good God...
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
You know she has it out for him now.
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
Sorry.
Thank you.
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
So, he's alive.
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
Yeah.
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
Go-Go dancers?
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
But we don't keep two sets of books.
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
I don't care.
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
A Catholic schoolgirl?
It's not my problem. [dials phone]
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
Honey, say something!
Hi.
Absolutely not.
Yeah.
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
Sorry! Bye, Andy!
What does that mean?
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
Are you going? [to Dwight]
Be good.
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look]
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
Mm-mm
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
Dwight, we're fine!
[Phillip cries] See the duckie!
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
Are you serious?  This is so offensive.
On it!
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
I don���t like your friend Trevor.
No.
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
Yeah, I can see that.
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
Ew! Oh.
Yes!
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
Oh.
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
Please just take my name off of everything.
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
Call him!
Fine.
I have to go clean up after the party.
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
Everyone put on sunscreen.
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
Are you drunk?
What? [knock at the door] Okay.
Michael do something about this.
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
I think you have me confused with another person.
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
Yes.
So cute.
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
Oscar!
I said, okay.
But we signed the contract.
Sounds fun.
Ow.
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
Ooh!
Alright, let's go, let's go.
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
What are you doing?
Go in single file lines.
I'm just leaving for the day.
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
No Star Trek names.
Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
I'm sure.
Someone put them in my bag.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
Ow! He pinched me!
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
[reverently] He is fiercely intelligent.
We think you might kill Robert.
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
No.
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
What about me? ���Klokken tre pige���
We get it.
God help you.
Go, let's go.
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
Ugh.
Oh, what is that?
This is all pathetic.
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
Well, when you have coffee breath-
I guess.
Are you enjoying your fiesta?
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
No!
Yeah!
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
They���re sleeping with my husband.
We both-you didn't dup-
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
No.
No, no, no.
Sure.
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
[calling in, unseen] I have next meeting!
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
I don't care, and you won't.
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
Were you?
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
I do.
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
Excuse me?
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
There.
No.
Ugh.
Can���t I just agree without putting my hand in?
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
I think the senator is having an affair.
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
It doesn't matter, Michael.
People love it.
Sure.
Hello, Pam.
Will you lock the door?
Do you even have a mattress?
Sparkling cider is very good.
No, don't throw those out!
Two hundred dollars.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
Stop it.
Yeah.
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
It's alright.
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
Ow!
You! [hits Dwight]
Yes.
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
No. No.
[still sobbing]
Psst. Hey. Erin.
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
It was just you...
God! [kicks Oscar]
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
Email forwards.
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
[crying] It���s just a really nice song.
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
Mmhmm.
Yes!
Oh...
What do you mean?
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
Fine.
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
No. We heard that about Jim.
I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
Shut up!
Oh my god!
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Want me to say it again?
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
Absolutely not.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
Have you signed the expense reports yet?
Michael, did you finish yet?
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
Oh, God.
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
You have to use chains?
I'm right here.
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
You got it.
I want eye contact.
Uh-huh.
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
God! Kevin!
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
It's a new corporate policy.
Mm-Hmm.
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
Love you! [Oscar hangs up] God.
Thank You.
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
Some of us got both. [raises hand]
No.
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
Mm-hmm.  Tales of bravery.
I would very much like that.
Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?
No seafood.
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
You know I was thinking...
I know. I'm taking them down.
Stop...
Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk]
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Thank you.
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
Okay.
I don't think that's appropriate.
Call him! [hits Oscar]
You behaved very badly tonight.
Well, I���ve changed my mind.
Michael.
Okay! Everybody!
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
[to minister] Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-
That is so unnecessary!
Hey, come inside and talk to me.
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
Kevin, relax.
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings]
Michael.
Nobody's named Monday.
Hey.
Rolph, did you not hear me?
It's fine.
Hey. You wanted to see me?
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
No! God, Mose! God!
Thank you.
I care!
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
Yes, a knee-capping could work.
What?
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
My boyfriend.
Stop!
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
This is illegal.
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
No. I haven't thought of it.
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
Okay.
Yeah. [Oscar shakes his head no]
Okay. Oh, thank you.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
She wouldn't do that. She's a Senator.
I don't know why I write my name on things.
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
No, none���No, stop. It���s just���
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
Oh my God! Dwight!
It was excellent.
What?
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
That's your toast?
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
Will you marry me?
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
You two are apes.
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
Stop it Kevin!
It's Angela and Oscar.
Yeah, that's a good one.
No! No!
We're not.
What is so funny?
My baby is not a monster!
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
No, I'm not.
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
Oh, God.
Unbelievable!
Did you have fun at Benihana's?
