Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
You know she has it out for him now.
Please just take my name off of everything.
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
I think you have me confused with another person.
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
This is how you make this important decision?
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
I think I'd like to go home now.
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
I don't understand what you want from me.
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
You said you would be there for me.
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
I have to go clean up after the party.
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
I don't know why I write my name on things.
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
Will you help me put it over there?
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
What am I supposed to do with this?
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
How long does it take to get the results?
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
I made a vow. I gave my word.
I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
I knew it. You should see their baby.
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
How can she make you get back together with her?
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
... doing the work that could be done by two.
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
Can I go back to my desk now?
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
But we don't keep two sets of books.
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
But I don't see how this is my problem.
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
You're not going to get my permission on this.
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
