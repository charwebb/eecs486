Stop it Kevin!
What are you...?
Put your hands in your pockets.
Well, it does.  That's me.
Yes.
Come on, right now.
You're ahead.
Little Cici asleep?
Ugh.
Hey. You wanted to see me?
Someone put them in my bag.
No, orange is whorish.
I'm so glad you could come.
People are dressed inappropriately.
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
No.
Safety partners.
[grabs cake] Oh. Thank you.
Ow! He pinched me!
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
Hello Aunt Shirley.
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
Excuse me?
Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.
People red vine.
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
Bye!
This is a cold pack...
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
Now. Come on, up here!
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
Yeah. [Oscar shakes his head no]
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
He's out sick.
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
No, I didn't.
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
He's blocking me.
In a general sense.
It's fabric! I really wanted this.
No. No.
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
Hi, Dwight.
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
It's really happening!
[walks away]
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
Oh my god!
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
I don't know.
You don���t carry it with you?
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
[meows like a cat, then hisses]
So a child had fallen in?
What?
Fifty.
Fine! It���s Oscar. So what?
Call him! Call him!
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
Judges and juries!
Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
Allergies.
I don't care, but yes.
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
[whispering]
Everyone put on sunscreen.
Psst. Hey. Erin.
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
Stop it.
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
I have to hang these.
Come on!
Let me know.
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
Want me to say it again?
I have one, yes.
I have some ideas about conservation...
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
Michael.
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
Are you allowed to have pets?
She wouldn't do that. She's a Senator.
Dwight!
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
It's hard.
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
Thanks.
It's Angela and Oscar.
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
Spring cleaning?
Confetti.
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
That's not happening.
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
No Dwight, I won't- [hoses Dwight]
Right.
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
Congratulations Dwight.
You need a hair cut.
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
That town is full of history!
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
Michael do something about this.
Nothing, Kevin.
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
You don't understand.
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
Have you taken any concrete steps?
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
What?
Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
What? What is it?
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
Don't just say things.
You're a freak!
What? Kevin!
No, you will not.
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
What is this?
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
Ok.
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
I don���t like your friend Trevor.
Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
I don't care.
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
Yes!
What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Sure.
That is where we disagree.
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
You're safety partners!
[crying] It���s just a really nice song.
It's outside.
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
I don't like my character.
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
No. You need to sign them all.
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
The party starts in an hour.
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
Are you sure?
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
Phyllis?
Black eye, Meredith.
Jedediah.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
What?
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
Absolutely not.
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
Oh...
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
Oscar.
Good.
I'm not voting.
Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
Are we out of jobs?
Ok, you go to the store.
Oh my God.
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
This is a big day for you.
All right!
Yeah.
Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.
You could out-sell Michael any day.
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
Your hand's in it.
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
I want eye contact.
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
... doing the work that could be done by two.
No, Kevin, no.
Kevin! That's inappropriate.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
I never felt safe here.
Great.[Angela walks away]
This is all pathetic.
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
[sighs]
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
I tried. We didn't have time.
[gasps]
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
It's a new corporate policy.
Good luck, Dwight.
What do you want?
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
Phyllis. You're a married woman.
Michael...
How did you, um, where did you...
Come on!
Please, after the turtle?
[to Kevin] Language.
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
Thank you. [sniffles]
I have to visit the alchy.
What is this?
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
You never told us to close them.
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
Did you bring your jerky in again?
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
The senator.
My boyfriend.
Chocolates?  Someone famous?
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
[upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh!
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
Honey! What are you doing here?
Thank you.
No, not at all.
I didn't get mine yet.
Fine.
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
I will not, it's not-
No, it wasn���t.
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
But I don't see how this is my problem.
Ugh.
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
Yes.
I have to go clean up after the party.
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
No, no!
Hmm, I liked it.
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
You're expanding on your worst idea.
Okay.
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
I work with Dwight.
Those aren't chips and dip.
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
Oh, Dwight, just move.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
Really?
No.
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
Can you arrange a meeting?
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
[flustered] Well... good for Dwight.
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
You know she has it out for him now.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
Kelly's training us?
What does that mean?
It's alright.
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
Kevin, where are you going?
I do not wanna talk about this.
Excuse me?
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
Thank You.
Uh-huh.
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
My Phillip is crawling.
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
If you know something Michael...
Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
Is just looks bad.
It doesn't matter, Michael.
You're not going to get my permission on this.
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
Really? Well, I hope I do.
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
They're Sugarplum fairy wands.
Oh, God.
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
What is so funny?
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Shut up!
What are you doing?
[gasps]
The dream team... and Meredith.
Huh.
That's... no...
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
Ew.
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
I can't be your monkey, Dwight.
I already did.
Oh my God! Dwight!
[sees Kevin's toupee] Oh my God.
What?
Are you married?
Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
Okay. Oh, thank you.
Do not panic.
I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Murder.
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
Really?
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
Yes.
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
Yes, a knee-capping could work.
They���re sleeping with my husband.
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
Stop it!
No one said 'you must have two'
Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!
You gave birth in a tub?
I was.
But I don't understand. It's for managers.
We can talk right here.
He���s always been like that.
What do you mean?
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
No.
Where's Dwight?
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Call him!
Pam, my bag was there...
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
Thank you.
I'm sure Dwight will protect him.
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
Ow! Dwight! Ow!
We will discuss this later.
Two, one...
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Why wouldn't we come?
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
I think you've had enough.
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
[shaking head in disbelief] No.
Kevin, come.
Good night, D.
Dwight!
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
No.
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
I, barely know him...
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
I called you morons.
No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot]
Hi.
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
What are you talking about Michael?
Aw, preemie pajamas!
It's not an office expense.
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
Will you help me put it over there?
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...
And person.
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
Yes!
I'm sorry... that you're both morons.
Aw, crap.
Are you drunk?
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
I don't think that's appropriate.
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
No, none���No, stop. It���s just���
Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
It was all my fault.
How thoughtful.
The DaVinci Code!
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
...but it's totally inappropriate.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Thanks.
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
Six-seventy, six-twenty.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
Ohhhh!
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
What?
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]
Thank you.
Michael, do something.
Never.
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
Whoo!
No thank you.
I made a vow. I gave my word.
Hi.
People love it.
I think green is kind of whoreish.
You two are apes.
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
So you fell in?
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
He's hungry.
Mm-hmm.
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
[disbelieving] Really?
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
I hate beet salad.
Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
Extension 128.
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
Yeah, I can see that.
Oh. [hands Pam tape]
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
Good night, Dwight.
Watching some of your friends.
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
Don't!
Shut up.
Love you! [Oscar hangs up] God.
A nun?
What!?
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
And what...
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
Will you lock the door?
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
No, I don���t��� no.
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
Oh, god.
Good.
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
Ugh!
Nothing for me?
No! No!
Ow!
[reverently] He is fiercely intelligent.
[nods]
I shredded it.
Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head]
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
Yeah.
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
Deep fried Twinkies?  It's gross!
What are you doing here?
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
I'm the head accountant.
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
Let���s go Kelly.
Of course.
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
Hey D.
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
Yes?
Yes, yes. He's sleeping.
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Come on, you're safety partners!
He���s here.
I love you.
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
Ugh.
Have a great day.
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
Andy, what are you doing?
It would never work here.
Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
Sounds fun.
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
Those aren't helpful.
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
No.
Come here, come here. Let's go.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
I would very much like that.
Thank you.
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
I did not. Uh-uh.
I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look]
Rude.
Okay.
Dwight, we're fine!
I don't know why I write my name on things.
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
[starts sobbing] I love him.
In your nose?
Okay.
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
I didn't apologize.
We are not married.
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
Go-Go dancers?
Yes.
Ow! What are you doing?
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
Yes.
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
Everything.
No, I meant... [motions you and me]
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
Absolutely not.
[flustered] Goodness.
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
No! God, Mose! God!
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
Hello, Pam.
No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
We both-you didn't dup-
Maybe.
Okay.
Dwight, you should be running this office.
Two hundred dollars.
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Mmhmm.
Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.
Okay.
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
Are you enjoying your fiesta?
I said nothing fancy.
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
Hmm.
Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room]
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
We'll see.
Pay him whatever he wants.
There should be some ..
What a surprise.
Oh!
Well, I won't tell if you don't.
Yeah!
I'll help you!
They arrived this morning.
What does that mean?
Okay���
Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings]
There.
Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
Are you serious?  This is so offensive.
Can���t I just agree without putting my hand in?
Why?
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
It's ok.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
Yes, he is.
Thank you. [both laugh]
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
That's why you're not in charge Meredith.
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
No. We heard that about Jim.
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
Yes.
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?
But...
Yes it does!
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
How long does it take to get the results?
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
What?
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Oh. Thanks.
Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
Come.
Oh, what is that?
Did Toby approve this?
I know.
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
It's an experiment.
Sometimes you talk to us real close.
You won't see-
My name is Angela.
Oh.
What about me? ���Klokken tre pige���
Bless you.
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
No.
You were supposed to be my friend.
Thank you.
No.
[sighs] All right!
Oh no. [laughs]
It's fake.
God!
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
You did kill her!?
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
Meaning what?
You know what Pam just save it.
1434-967, paid.
No! Stop it!
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
Alright, let's go, let's go.
So you keep a very tidy house.
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Sign.
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
We're in the pool!
He's not weird, he's just individualistic.
Phillip���s your son.
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
The glitter is blinding.
Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!
What is that?
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
Whack.
Has she done the pageant circuit?
[Phillip cries] See the duckie!
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
[walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen.
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
What are you doing?
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
Please stop making me do these things.
Do you have any pastries without fruit?
Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
What is that?  What is that?
And I lied to you.
Then roll an eight.
It was excellent.
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
He put you right in front of me?
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
Nosy?
Michael.
Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.
...Okay.
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.'
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
Ugh.
But--
Sign.
I will not.
God! Kevin!
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
It's nothing.
The guys?
Uh-huh.
Mm-Hmm.
Andy, is this you?
[sighs] Yes, that's true.
I understand.
Gladly. I quit.
Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
I guess I have.  Huh.
Such a precious little angel.
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
No.
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
What?
Ugh.
[coughs for attention]
Ah!
No.
How could you do that without telling me?
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
What? [knock at the door] Okay.
No she shouldn't.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
No, no, no.
Sure.
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
Is that all?
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
Be good.
I know who this is!
I'm a vegetarian.
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
Manure. Get rid of it.
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Oh, thanks, Oscar. You���re such an angel.
I don't understand what you want from me.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
Where is it?
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
Mm-hmm.  Tales of bravery.
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
You're in my way!
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
Alright, I think I'm trained.
I don't think that this is---
No.
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
This is just offensive.
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
Stop...
Are you authorized to do this?
Were you?
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
There's still an hour.
Kevin?
Kevin, what's four plus seven?
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
Oh, it is warm.
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
It was just you...
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
You can't go in yet!
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
Any problems?
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Mm-hmm.
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
I think I'd like to go home now.
Apparently.
Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.
I knew it!
Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
Oscar.
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
Well then. Have a nice day.
Yes.
Cool music.
[Spits champagne back into her glass]
Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
Elevators.
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
Stop!
What am I supposed to do with this?
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Obviously.
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
What do we do about our heads?
[on phone] Hello? Hello?
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
What?
Ugh. Eww!
I don't take any prescription drugs.
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
You shouldn't joke about that.
Have you signed the expense reports yet?
It's not my problem. [dials phone]
Mm-Hmm.
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
Dwight! That doesn't count!
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Don't encourage him, Dwight.
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
Will you marry me?
Hey.
The Bible.
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
Yes.
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
Why are you doing this to Andy?
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
Thank you.
[cutting in] No! Don't!
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
I don't like it. [Angela leaves]
That doesn't sound like me.
Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal.
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
No, he���s fine.
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
Yes, it was.
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
Do you think he's signed them yet?
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
Hey.
Rachel, are you all right?
Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl?
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
Rolph, did you not hear me?
Perfect!
No.
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
Take this thing. [takes off twine ring]
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
I don't approve.  I don't.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
What the hell is happening?
This is illegal.
Yes. And he didn���t like it.
Ow.
Can you put that down there?
[on phone] It was an unfortunate error.
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Goodbye.
Yes. Congratulations.
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.
Dwight?
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
I'm right here.
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
Is it cool in here to you?
Dwight?
Sales take a long time.
Yeah, neither did I.
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
Yes it is.
It sounds mean.
Good God...
No.
We can make a difference here.
Okay, bye.
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
You
Decent people everywhere will get offended.
Something made of ice?
I knew it. You should see their baby.
So, what happened?
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
There's no fizz in this punch. Phyllis!
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
But we signed the contract.
I'm not dating you.
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
Did you guys figure it out?
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
Thank you.
Wha? Who gave you that advice?
What?
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
Mm-hmm.
Please don���t teach the cat French.
Mmm hmmm.
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
We can save that.
That's never the case.
It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy.
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
Really? [to Dwight] Thank you.
I don't think that...
It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
Well, this is intimate.
Completely unacceptable.
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
Kevin!
But he's an idiot!
I didn't ask you to scratch it.
But we don't keep two sets of books.
We're not.
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
Dwight?
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
You already did me.
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
That is completely untrue.
What are you doing?
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
What?
I don't--
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
No.
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
With who?
No, Dwight!
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
Well, when you have coffee breath-
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
Well, for our profit...
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
I guess.
[laughing] It's a man eating cat food.
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
[to minister] Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-
This looks like a hoot.
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
Do you even have a mattress?
Bye.
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
He's just....
No.  Are we supposed to?
You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
Hey!
There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
Sure.
I'm his! His... wife.
Honey, say something!
Do not panic!
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
I can't do this.
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
So cute.
How many gods do you have?
Spray her down?
Cecilia....and Phillip.
Sorry! Bye, Andy!
Is it called red-vining?
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
Yes.
Great, then it doesn't matter.
No Star Trek names.
[sobbing]
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
Oh.
Oscar!
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
I won't be watching, and I won't.
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
Can you put that down?
Okay, watch it.
How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
Is that really necessary?
Phillip?
Alright.
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
I think the senator is having an affair.
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Uh-uh, leave us alone.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
Probably.
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Dwight.
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
Paid.
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Yes.
Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
[removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!
What?
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
Hi.
No Dwight!
How is that a bad rumor?
Can I go back to my desk now?
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Some of us got both. [raises hand]
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
[Michael tries to hug Angela] No, no.
A little bit.
Yes, that's the problem.
Heh.
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
Another clue, another clue.
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
OK, it's three forty eight.
[calling in, unseen] I have next meeting!
Did you try the petting zoo?
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Shut up.
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
What?
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
[smiles knowingly]
No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
Wha -
Agreed.
Hey.
Charles, where were you born?
... that has three people...
Yeah.
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
No, not the senator. I love Dwight.
Hey, come inside and talk to me.
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
He's just trying to push your buttons.
It does!
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
Pam, we have a great idea.
I wouldn't put it past her.
Oh, my Lord.
Shh.
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
It���s too loud.
Guh.
[gags]
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
I am.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
What color do you guys think?
Please.
Okay.
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
You! [hits Dwight]
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
Yeah, uh no.
Ooh!
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
Kevin, come.
No seafood.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
It's supposed to say launch!
Where?
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
Fine.
No. You know-no!
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
It'll be fun.
I didn't-
Let's do it.
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Thank you.
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
Just a few quick things.
Black widow.
Dwight?
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
Yeah. And I said sorry.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
Seven thousand dollars.
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
Stop it.
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
Jedediah.
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
Gah.
No. No.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
Very much. How's your meat?
Andy.
I would like cat.
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
Seven, two...
You'll see me in small claims court!
Fine.
I wrote it out.
Enough Oscar, enough.
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
No.
No.
I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.
No.
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
Sprinkles.
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
I think we're good.
You embarrassed me earlier.
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
Email forwards.
I do.
We get it.
Yes.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
No, it's an invitation.
What, Pam?
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
What if they deserved it?
No, Dwight. The Senator.
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
Nobody's named Monday.
No!
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Go, let's go.
A Catholic schoolgirl?
I can't, Sprinkles is sick.
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
It's OK.
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
Did you think I stole your baby?
What about my cherub figurine?
Kevin, could you not do that?
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
No. This is a closed door meeting.
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
How can she make you get back together with her?
Good morning.
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
What do you mean by ���poisoned���?
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk]
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
Unbelievable!
Okay.
Are you going? [to Dwight]
Zip it, Meredith.
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
What have you heard?
I can play.
I don't.
You saw it?  Describe it please.
I got sap on me.
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
I find this incredibly offensive.
I don't care, and you won't.
Yeah!
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
It's after my cat.
Oops.
Amen.
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
This is my favorite day.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
None of them. Especially not Andy.
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
Thank you.
But it's the season of mercy.
You���re a dad!
What if it's a girl?
It's no worry.
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!
No!
I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
Stop it.
Please just take my name off of everything.
This is not work talk.
Lacrosse, the sport?
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
No.
Mm-mm
What?
Goodie.
I care!
I don���t know.
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
[quickly] Amen.
Her name was Sprinkles.
Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
I know. I'm taking them down.
You never... you don't like them.
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
Yeah.
Michael wrote down 'Astird.'
Do you have a gun?
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
You're bad at this too!
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
Go in single file lines.
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
Why'd you stop it?
You know I was thinking...
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
No. I haven't thought of it.
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
It's ridiculous.
Nine, eight, five...
Call him! [hits Oscar]
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
What?
Oscar.
No.
You're gonna wait here?
Kevin, relax.
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
Not here.
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
[sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God!
You have to use chains?
Do they even have a bakery anymore?
And I made cookies. Same category.
This is from Hooters.
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
[shakes her head disapprovingly]
Yeah.
[sighs]
My baby is not a monster!
What is this?
No.
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
His hair's flipping out on the sides.
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
I can't do it.
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
Hi.
Wait, what is this?
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
[walks around Andy's new car keying it]
Yeah, it is, Andy.
I said, okay.
Nothing. Should be fun.
Mm-hm.
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
No, stop! Just don't.
These are for employees only.
That is so unnecessary!
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
God help you.
You said you would be there for me.
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
Mmhmm.
That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
Don't Meredith.
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
I heard you. [quickly walks away]
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
Fine.
No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
No.
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
yes!
It's the nativity scene.
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
Sorry.
Is it any good?
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
Daycare won���t take Phillip anymore.
Uh!
That's Phyllis.
But, it...
I do like it, actually.
Dwight!
Oh.
No, don't throw those out!
D?
Thank you.
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
Welcome back.
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
[Gives Dwight a knowing look]
You behaved very badly tonight.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Pull me up!
Mmhm.
Are you drunk?
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
Oh God!
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
Amen.
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
I think Andy makes an excellent point.
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
Something like that.
Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
No, it doesn't!
What is it?
Is this spicy?
Uh-huh.
Right?
God! [kicks Oscar]
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
What do you hear?
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
What���s going on?
Dwight!
Why?
Why don���t you pack it?
Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
Did he not tell you that?
How about, I leave it up?
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
No, I'm not.
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
That's enough.
Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
Oh my god!
No, that���s not���
You got it.
Yes, What are you doing here?
Michael, did you finish yet?
