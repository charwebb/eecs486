Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
Can I go back to my desk now?
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
You're not going to get my permission on this.
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Can���t I just agree without putting my hand in?
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
What? Why did you call me out here?
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
You said you would be there for me.
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
I think you have me confused with another person.
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
Please just take my name off of everything.
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
What am I supposed to do with this?
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
I knew it. You should see their baby.
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
... doing the work that could be done by two.
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
I made a vow. I gave my word.
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
But I don't see how this is my problem.
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
This is how you make this important decision?
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
But we don't keep two sets of books.
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
How could you do that without telling me?
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
He put you right in front of me?
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
I don't know why I write my name on things.
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
You know she has it out for him now.
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
How long does it take to get the results?
I think the senator is having an affair.
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
How can she make you get back together with her?
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
I think I'd like to go home now.
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
I have to go clean up after the party.
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
Will you help me put it over there?
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
I don't understand what you want from me.
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
