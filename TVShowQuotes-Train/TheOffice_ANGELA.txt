No Star Trek names.
You're useless.
Kevin! That's inappropriate.
[reverently] He is fiercely intelligent.
Heh.
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
What do you mean?
There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
Ow!
I didn't-
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
So what are your credentials?
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
Are you authorized to do this?
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
People red vine.
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
I knew it. You should see their baby.
I guess I have.  Huh.
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
Do not panic!
What?
I tried. We didn't have time.
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
Thank you.
[disbelieving] Really?
Bless you.
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
Uh-huh.
There.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
Oh. Thanks.
Have you taken any concrete steps?
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
You! [hits Dwight]
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
I didn't apologize.
Go in single file lines.
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
Thank you.
That's why you're not in charge Meredith.
Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
Kelly's training us?
[to Kevin] Language.
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
No Dwight!
[Dwight slaps her butt] Hey!
You���re a dad!
Well, I���ve changed my mind.
Sounds fun.
Just a few quick things.
No. You need to sign them all.
There should be some ..
Well, it does.  That's me.
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
Good afternoon.
No, not at all.
Paid.
[on phone] It was an unfortunate error.
It���s too loud.
I will not.
I think green is kind of whoreish.
Please stop making me do these things.
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
Okay.
It's alright.
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
Ok, you go to the store.
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
What? Kevin!
You put her in my freezer.
Michael.
Why?
Why are you doing this to Andy?
Absolutely not.
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
I guess.
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
But--
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
A nun?
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
A Purpose Driven Life.
Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Meaning what?
Do you have a gun?
Welcome back.
But it's the season of mercy.
Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?
Daycare won���t take Phillip anymore.
No.
I work with Dwight.
Kevin, what's four plus seven?
Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings]
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
You were supposed to be my friend.
[gags]
What does that mean?
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
Are you enjoying your fiesta?
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
yes!
These are for employees only.
Bye.
No. You know-no!
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
Waste of time.
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
Hi.
Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
[laughing] It's a man eating cat food.
Come.
Enough Oscar, enough.
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
You're gonna wait here?
No.
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
Thanks.
That's enough.
I didn't get mine yet.
I have to go clean up after the party.
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
Oh.
I think Andy makes an excellent point.
Oh, God.
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
Is just looks bad.
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Ahh! Dwight!
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
Uh-huh.
Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?
[quickly] Amen.
[sighs] Yes, that's true.
Kevin, where are you going?
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
What?
Oscar.
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
Why'd you stop it?
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
Yes!
Mm-mm
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
Yes.
Have you signed the expense reports yet?
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
Don't!
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
I don't know.
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
But he's an idiot!
Hmm.
[Phillip cries] See the duckie!
No, Dwight. The Senator.
Thank you.
I don't think that this is---
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Did you think I stole your baby?
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
No, you will not.
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
I have to visit the alchy.
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
You never... you don't like them.
It's beautiful.
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
...but it's totally inappropriate.
You're a freak!
I do like it, actually.
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
And I made cookies. Same category.
Really, Pam...
No.
No! God, Mose! God!
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
I've seen some of your spreadsheets.
Ow.
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
Mmhmm.
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
You shouldn't joke about that.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Kevin, relax.
What?
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
I want eye contact.
Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk]
Not here.
Dwight?
Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
Oh. [hands Pam tape]
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
Goodbye.
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
[approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!
That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
No.
You won't see-
We can make a difference here.
Meredith, too far!
Gladly. I quit.
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
This is just offensive.
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
Ow! What are you doing?
Kevin, come.
I can't, Sprinkles is sick.
Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
Dwight?
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
Don't encourage him, Dwight.
It does!
No.  Are we supposed to?
Hi.
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
[starts sobbing] I love him.
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
Stop...
Yes.
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
I think we're good.
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
Yeah, neither did I.
Everyone put on sunscreen.
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
Then roll an eight.
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
I do.
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
People love it.
Never.
Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
You said you would be there for me.
Ow!
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
No, I meant... [motions you and me]
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.
What are you doing?
Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.
[walks away]
I got sap on me.
Thank You.
[walks around Andy's new car keying it]
Hi.
What is that?  What is that?
Go-Go dancers?
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
[walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen.
No. No.
Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
Michael!
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
Oh my god!
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
I wouldn't put it past her.
Rachel, are you all right?
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
No, I don���t��� no.
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
[coughs for attention]
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
Seven thousand dollars.
Spray her down?
Watching some of your friends.
Very much. How's your meat?
Mm-hmm.  Tales of bravery.
Yes.
Let���s go Kelly.
But I don't see how this is my problem.
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
Black widow.
No.
Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
You gave birth in a tub?
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
No, don't throw those out!
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
You're ahead.
Is that all?
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
[shakes her head disapprovingly]
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
[nods]
No. I haven't thought of it.
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
Andy, what are you doing?
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
What a surprise.
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
I'm sure.
Okay���
What is so funny?
But we don't keep two sets of books.
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
No!
I don���t like your friend Trevor.
What?
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
Murder.
It was all my fault.
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
What?
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
[still sobbing]
Fine.
How about, I leave it up?
Thank you.
I know who this is!
That's your toast?
Are you sure?
Alright, let's go, let's go.
What?
I'm sure Dwight will protect him.
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
No! No!
No, he���s fine.
Aw, crap.
It sounds mean.
Andy.
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
That's why we're cursed.
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
You could out-sell Michael any day.
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
God!
Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
Email forwards.
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
[on phone] Hello? Hello?
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
I think you've had enough.
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
What���s going on?
Oh, thanks, Oscar. You���re such an angel.
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
We can save that.
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
No, I'm not.
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
Thanks again, Charles.
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
What about me? ���Klokken tre pige���
Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
It's fine.
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
In your nose?
How could you do that without telling me?
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
Mmhmm.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
Fifty.
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
No.
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
Where?
Gah.
Stop it!
Last week.
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
But I don't understand. It's for managers.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
[gasps]
Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
Chocolates?  Someone famous?
No, Dwight!
You're in my way!
No.
No. We heard that about Jim.
I knew it!
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Dwight!
It'll be fun.
Why?
No thank you, Roy.
Do you even have a mattress?
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
Ugh.
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
God! [kicks Oscar]
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
I don't know why I write my name on things.
I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
No.
Right?
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
Oscar.
No, orange is whorish.
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
I hate beet salad.
Will you marry me?
I can play.
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
Good luck, Dwight.
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
It's an experiment.
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
This is my big sister Rachel.
Thank you.
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
The party starts in an hour.
And I lied to you.
Ew! Oh.
I don't care, and you won't.
Okay.
I shredded it.
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
What is this?
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
No.
Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.'
It's OK.
You
So a child had fallen in?
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
What? Why did you call me out here?
Whoo!
I heard you. [quickly walks away]
No.
Come on, right now.
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
Okay! Everybody!
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
No, I didn't.
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
I don't care.
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
Thank you.
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
God!
Did you have fun at Benihana's?
Same page. Go to the next one.
Do they even have a bakery anymore?
God! Kevin!
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
Thank you.
Good God...
Yes, yes. He's sleeping.
Do you think he's signed them yet?
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
Well���
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
Please, after the turtle?
[cutting in] No! Don't!
Yes.
What?
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
How is that a bad rumor?
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
Take this thing. [takes off twine ring]
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Shut up.
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
Yeah. [Oscar shakes his head no]
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
No.
Wha? Who gave you that advice?
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
Why?
[crying] It���s just a really nice song.
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
Alright, I think I'm trained.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
Okay.
God help you.
There's still an hour.
Stop!
No seafood.
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
I'm a vegetarian.
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
I was.
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
The guys?
Sure.
[sighs]
Uh!
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
I think I'd like to go home now.
This is how you make this important decision?
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Yeah.
Did Toby approve this?
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
You know she has it out for him now.
All right!
Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
But we signed the contract.
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
He���s here.
What?
No.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
[Michael tries to hug Angela] No, no.
No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
Is that really necessary?
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
Okay.
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
Sign.
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
Nothing for me?
No. This is a closed door meeting.
Dwight, we're fine!
You behaved very badly tonight.
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
And what...
Oscar!
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Oh, Dwight, just move.
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
You don���t want me at your place.
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
What?
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
No, that���s not���
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
I heard a joke today.
Any problems?
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
No.
What have you heard?
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
D?
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
[sobbing]
Hey D.
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
Oh no. [laughs]
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
You're not going to get my permission on this.
They���re sleeping with my husband.
It's nothing.
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
Yes.
No, no, no.
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
Thanks.
I never felt safe here.
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
Sparkling cider is very good.
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
This is illegal.
Okay.
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
I'm the head accountant.
Are you allowed to have pets?
What?
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
It's the nativity scene.
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
Sometimes you talk to us real close.
So, what happened?
Phyllis. You're a married woman.
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
You'll see me in small claims court!
What?
Andy?
I don't.
What does that mean?
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
This is all pathetic.
Dwight.
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
[to minister] Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-
Absolutely not.
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
... doing the work that could be done by two.
Yeah, uh no.
Are you drunk?
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
Yes, it was.
Great, then it doesn't matter.
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
Oh.
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
Really? [to Dwight] Thank you.
No, it wasn���t.
I will not, it's not-
Okay. Oh, thank you.
Yes.
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Mm-hmm.
Dwight?
Hey. You wanted to see me?
Can I go back to my desk now?
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
Yes.
Are you drunk?
Stop it.
Nothing, Kevin.
Pam, my bag was there...
Will you lock the door?
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
He's not weird, he's just individualistic.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
I won't be watching, and I won't.
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot]
I said, okay.
Please.
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
What are you doing here?
Excuse me?
Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
I don't think that's appropriate.
Is it called red-vining?
Good.
Do you have any pastries without fruit?
Rolph, did you not hear me?
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
Yes. And he didn���t like it.
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
Nosy?
Such a precious little angel.
[flustered] Well... good for Dwight.
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
Ugh.
What? What is it?
Stop it Kevin!
No.
Shut up.
Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
I don't like my character.
How did you, um, where did you...
OK, it's three forty eight.
I'm just leaving for the day.
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
[flustered] Goodness.
Let's do it.
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
Yes!
This is a cold pack...
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
That doesn't sound like me.
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
Mm-Hmm.
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
Whack.
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
Oops.
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
We can talk right here.
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
[whispering]
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
Oh, it is warm.
He's hungry.
Mm-hmm.
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
I know.
You're safety partners!
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
Why do you want this cat?
Yeah, I can see that.
What about the surprise?
I said nothing fancy.
You don't understand.
Oh...
Her name was Sprinkles.
I love you.
The senator will be joining us later.
I'll help you!
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
Unbelievable!
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
No.
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
I'm so glad you could come.
I think you have me confused with another person.
Yeah!
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl?
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
It was just you...
Good night, D.
Hey.
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
Yeah.
That is completely untrue.
That's never the case.
Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.
Thank you. [both laugh]
Hi.
I'm right here.
No.
Are we out of jobs?
Oh.
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
I care!
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
Hey!
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
Yes, he is.
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
Yes, that's the problem.
He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
Well, it better work.
You embarrassed me earlier.
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
No Dwight, I won't- [hoses Dwight]
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
Ugh.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
This is from Hooters.
Guh.
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
Thank you.
Allergies.
Six-seventy, six-twenty.
Rude.
No, it's ah...
Michael do something about this.
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
Yeah.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
I would like cat.
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
You can't go in yet!
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
The DaVinci Code!
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
It would never work here.
Will you help me put it over there?
Yes. Congratulations.
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
Ah!
Okay, watch it.
Don't Meredith.
Go, let's go.
Come here, come here. Let's go.
I look forward to it.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
I don���t know.
[shaking head in disbelief] No.
Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
I made a vow. I gave my word.
Aw, preemie pajamas!
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
What are you talking about Michael?
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Mm-hmm.
Dwight! That doesn't count!
Where's Dwight?
I called you morons.
Ugh.
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
It's fake.
No! Stop it!
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
Charity.  Bake drive.
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
I don���t���I don���t know why.
Yeah.
Now. Come on, up here!
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
Well, when you have coffee breath-
I would very much like that.
What are you doing?
Do not panic.
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
No.
We both-you didn't dup-
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
Pull me up!
Ugh.
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Thank you. [sniffles]
Ugh.
And person.
Another clue, another clue.
Can you put that down?
It's not my problem. [dials phone]
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
This is a big day for you.
Dwight!
No!
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
No.
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Who drives like that?
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
Jedediah.
Michael.
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
Mmm hmmm.
All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
In a general sense.
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
Yes, What are you doing here?
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
I think the senator is having an affair.
No, Kevin, no.
Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!
...Okay.
If you know something Michael...
I have to hang these.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
Completely unacceptable.
I didn't ask you to scratch it.
What do you mean by ���poisoned���?
What are you doing?
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
What color do you guys think?
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
What if they deserved it?
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Were you?
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
What!?
What, Pam?
Phyllis?
Love you! [Oscar hangs up] God.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
What if it's a girl?
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
My baby is not a monster!
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
You know what Pam just save it.
I can't be your monkey, Dwight.
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
He's just....
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
Oh, my Lord.
You're expanding on your worst idea.
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
Apparently.
Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
Okay.
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Michael wrote down 'Astird.'
Yes.
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
Come on!
No. No.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
Yes?
Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal.
None of them. Especially not Andy.
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Sure.
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
Oh my God.
How many gods do you have?
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Okay.
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Andy, is this you?
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
Oscar.
It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
It's outside.
Oh, what is that?
Hello Aunt Shirley.
But...
How long does it take to get the results?
No, stop! Just don't.
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
Well, this is intimate.
Cecilia....and Phillip.
How thoughtful.
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
What do you want?
He's blocking me.
Is it any good?
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Yeah.
Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
I don't think that...
Excuse me?
I don't understand what you want from me.
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?
Shut up!
It was excellent.
Really? Well, I hope I do.
My Phillip is crawling.
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
Yes it does!
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
Michael...
No she shouldn't.
Oh, no.
Sign.
Fine.
Little Cici asleep?
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
Kevin, come.
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
Yes.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
Great.[Angela walks away]
It's not an office expense.
I don't approve.  I don't.
You know I was thinking...
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
Two hundred dollars.
Ow! He pinched me!
Oh my god!
Spring cleaning?
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
Decent people everywhere will get offended.
His hair's flipping out on the sides.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
My boyfriend.
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
Ugh. Eww!
Ooh!
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Honey, say something!
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Dwight.
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
You don't know them all?
So, he's alive.
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
[grabs cake] Oh. Thank you.
Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
We're in the pool!
My name is Angela.
Safety partners.
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
Please don���t teach the cat French.
Where is it?
Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
[calling in, unseen] I have next meeting!
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
Mm-Hmm.
Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
I know. I'm taking them down.
That doesn't surprise me.
Dwight!
Hmm.
What the hell is happening?
Dwight!
Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
What do you hear?
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
Good.
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
Huh.
What are you...?
So you fell in?
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Come on, Dwight.
Please just take my name off of everything.
Hmm, I liked it.
We think you might kill Robert.
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
I, barely know him...
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
Obviously.
I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
Mm-hm.
Sorry! Bye, Andy!
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
Good night, Dwight.
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
I can't do this.
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
1434-967, paid.
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
You don���t carry it with you?
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
It's no worry.
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
Seven, two...
Why wouldn't we come?
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
Thank you.
[sighs] All right!
Shh.
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
Lacrosse, the sport?
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
It's ok.
I would watch that.
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
Michael, do something.
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
Hi, Dwight.
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
No, not the senator. I love Dwight.
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
Zip it, Meredith.
Thank you.
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
I am.
Jedediah.
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
Don't just say things.
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
You need a hair cut.
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
Thank you, Michael.
They're Sugarplum fairy wands.
Deep fried Twinkies?  It's gross!
No, no!
Hey.
People are dressed inappropriately.
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look]
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
Something made of ice?
Is this spicy?
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
Call him! [hits Oscar]
Two, one...
Uh-huh.
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Well, I won't tell if you don't.
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
I'm sorry... that you're both morons.
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
Yes.
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
Let me know.
Yeah.
Amen.
We're not.
It doesn't matter, Michael.
Kevin!
Goodie.
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
We get it.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
Hey, come inside and talk to me.
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
Really?
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
What is that?
Ohhhh!
Uh-uh, leave us alone.
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
I wrote it out.
Confetti.
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
Sorry.
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
I'm his! His... wife.
Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
You never told us to close them.
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
... that has three people...
Dwight, that's awful.
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
Everything.
I'm not dating you.
No, it doesn't!
Fine.
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
Yes.
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
Ow! Dwight! Ow!
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
Maybe.
God!
Okay.
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
Really?
It's supposed to say launch!
You got it.
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
Why isn't Jim wet?
Dwight, you should be running this office.
[Gives Dwight a knowing look]
Mmhm.
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
[meows like a cat, then hisses]
Did you guys figure it out?
No, it's an invitation.
Are you going? [to Dwight]
You two are apes.
Your hand's in it.
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
Michael, did you finish yet?
Want me to say it again?
Bye!
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Amen.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
What is this?
Come on!
This looks like a hoot.
No.
On it!
Where's my car? Come on.
You're bad at this too!
[removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!
[ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.
So you keep a very tidy house.
Did you try the petting zoo?
Good morning.
No. No.
[sees Kevin's toupee] Oh my God.
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
Call him! Call him!
He���s always been like that.
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
Be good.
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
Sure.
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
This is not work talk.
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!
I can't do it.
No.
Did he not tell you that?
You have to use chains?
I did not. Uh-uh.
Nobody's named Monday.
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
What do we do about our heads?
No thank you.
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
Is it cool in here to you?
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
That is where we disagree.
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Kevin, Kevin.
Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
Those aren't chips and dip.
The Bible.
I don't--
Black eye, Meredith.
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy.
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
Some of us got both. [raises hand]
Mmhmm.
What? [knock at the door] Okay.
Fine! It���s Oscar. So what?
Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
That didn't happen.
Yes.
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
It's hard.
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
Someone put them in my bag.
We'll see.
Of course.
I don't like it. [Angela leaves]
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
Sales take a long time.
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-
Are you married?
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
Call him!
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
I have one, yes.
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
The dream team... and Meredith.
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
No.
That's not happening.
Yeah. And I said sorry.
Has she done the pageant circuit?
We will discuss this later.
Elevators.
Pay him whatever he wants.
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
Well, for our profit...
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
Honey! What are you doing here?
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
It's really happening!
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
Can���t I just agree without putting my hand in?
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
It's fabric! I really wanted this.
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
I'm not voting.
Cool music.
A little bit.
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
He put you right in front of me?
So cute.
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
Okay, bye.
You did kill her!?
I could see enjoying that.
Why don���t you pack it?
I already did.
Something like that.
What?
Put your hands in your pockets.
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
Dwight?
No thank you.
But, it...
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
That's Phyllis.
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
I find this incredibly offensive.
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
A Catholic schoolgirl?
Ow!
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
Well then. Have a nice day.
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
