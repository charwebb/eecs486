No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
You're not going to get my permission on this.
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
How could you do that without telling me?
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
How can she make you get back together with her?
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
I think I'd like to go home now.
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
What am I supposed to do with this?
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
I think you have me confused with another person.
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
I don't understand what you want from me.
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
Can I go back to my desk now?
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
How long does it take to get the results?
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
I don't know why I write my name on things.
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
I have to go clean up after the party.
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
You know she has it out for him now.
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
I made a vow. I gave my word.
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
You said you would be there for me.
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
Can���t I just agree without putting my hand in?
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
But we don't keep two sets of books.
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
This is how you make this important decision?
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
I knew it. You should see their baby.
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
I think the senator is having an affair.
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
But I don't see how this is my problem.
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
Please just take my name off of everything.
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
He put you right in front of me?
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
... doing the work that could be done by two.
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
