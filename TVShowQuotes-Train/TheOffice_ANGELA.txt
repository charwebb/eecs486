Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
How long does it take to get the results?
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
Please just take my name off of everything.
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
I think I'd like to go home now.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
I knew it. You should see their baby.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
He put you right in front of me?
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
What am I supposed to do with this?
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
I think you have me confused with another person.
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
... doing the work that could be done by two.
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
Can I go back to my desk now?
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
I don't know why I write my name on things.
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
How could you do that without telling me?
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
How can she make you get back together with her?
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
I have to go clean up after the party.
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
Will you help me put it over there?
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
This is how you make this important decision?
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
I don't understand what you want from me.
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
I think the senator is having an affair.
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
Can���t I just agree without putting my hand in?
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
But we don't keep two sets of books.
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
You know she has it out for him now.
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
