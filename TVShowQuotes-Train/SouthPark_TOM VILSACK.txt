The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.
It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT! 
All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis!
