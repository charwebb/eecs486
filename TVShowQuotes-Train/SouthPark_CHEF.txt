Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.
…Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!  In the 1960s there was a monk  who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice!  To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing! 
Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.
It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.
Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out!  Okay children, this is your chance!
Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.
I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.
You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!
Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name.
Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.
I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!
Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! 
Drink this, Eric.  God help me! Heh, get it...  She's gone! Thank God!
Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to ya woman
Gonna lay ya down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make ya moan and perspire
Gonna--
You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.
That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!
And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, "Fudge This."
That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do! 
Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.
Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.
But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.
Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh?  Pretty cool, ain't it?
Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.
Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. 
My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.
I have a lo-o-o-o-o-ong way to come to go to raise the kind of money I need. 
Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.
Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.
Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?
Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?
Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.
Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!
Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle.  I can't figure it out at all. 
I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. 
How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?
Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.
They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems" 
How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!
Did you find out what the aliens were up to?
Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"
This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.
Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?
Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.
No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!
Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.
We have a chance to find the sunshine.
Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!
Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?
What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.
Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!
Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!
Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.
Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.
We have to find a way to stop those aliens!
Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press "menu," then "function." 
You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!
You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. 
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor.
This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.
Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.
Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.
Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
Have you all been sodomizing your children too?
It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!
Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember. 
Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
You have to say "Truth" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.
Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.
All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!
Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!
Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.
That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?
Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.
Well, sure.  Now, what's the matter, little cracker?
My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.
Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. 
I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.
Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature. 
Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?
Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.
Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with $2 million, I'm going to jail.
That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! 
Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. 
Oh, what have I done?  You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.  If we had won the world championship, what then?  It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.  Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?  Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.
Now move along, children, you're holding up the line! 
Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!
I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."
It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail.
Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you. 
But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
If we can hold on through the night.
We have a chance to find the sunshine.
Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! 
Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. 
Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!
It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.
No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...  What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam.
Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better.
Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?
Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.
You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!
Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?
Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?
Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, "Go Fudge Yourself," or my all-natural, "I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."
Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?
Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, "I'm in the house" instead of "I'm here." But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."
I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.
Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.
Tonight is the "Night of a Million Shits" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!
All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. 
No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.
Oh, damn it, not now!  Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!
Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
Father, why did you go to all this trouble?
We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!
So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!
That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. 
The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.
You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Huh?  Aw crap! Children!
He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.
Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... 
But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.
So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer,  "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote several years ago.
Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?
No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party. 
But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. 
Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a runor.
Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go. 
Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.
...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.
Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
Thank you Elton.
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.
Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!
I've been feelin' dйjа vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!
Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.
Of course not. Here. You children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
And they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
And the man says "I love you" and the woman says "hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom"
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says, "Baby, I'm gettin' hot!"
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...
Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.
From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!
Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.
Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.
Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?
Hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...
Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream.
Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back. 
Then, after a few "Truth"s, you finally answer, "Dare."
Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.
I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!
Hey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field.
I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.
Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!
Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.
Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?
That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that $2 million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!
Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.  Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. 
It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.
Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do! 
Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! 
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.
Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down.
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue.
So I'm supposed to press "menu," then "function," then "enter."
I made some chili to enter into the contest.
Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!
I don't think we're outta the woods yet. 
Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love.
Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!
Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!
We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, "What's the meaning of life?" or "Why are we here?".
It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.
But not like that, son. Like this: "Daaare". 
You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!
Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.
Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"
Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!
Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!
They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!
Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.
Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.
Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! 
Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool feature, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here-  No, no wait. You hit this button here  No, that's not it. Let's see.  Menu...  Function 
Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!
Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww! 
Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.
And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know; some slick glasses and shit.
Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!
...Yes, I pressed "menu" three times!  No! It's givin' me the same error message!  Yes I read the instruction manual!
I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children.  You should hang on to it.
That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe?
Right. But do you know why they're bad?
Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!
...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!
You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.
The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!
Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.
Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!
Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!
We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.
It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it. 
And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game.
No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her.
Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved!  Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?
Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
Okay children.  Now, who's gonna win the State Finals? 
I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.
My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.
Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! 
Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!
You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--
Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!
No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.  Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.  Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.
Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! 
Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years  and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.
Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! 
Like this very special device.  I call it "Chef’s pleasure bag".
Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!
Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, "Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls." 
Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.
Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!
Ooo, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red
And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye! 
Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass
Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..? 
Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.
Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. 
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!
Come on, man. What is this all about?
Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over.
Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.
You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.
Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.
Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
It's a little late for that bullcrap now.
Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!
Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.
Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?
Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.
Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.
Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?
Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. 
What makes you think I would know anything about that?
Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?
Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.
Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. 
I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-  Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? 
Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?
I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.
Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS!
Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.
Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?  Ask your parents for once!
Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.
But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!
All right. Now, where did you get served?
Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??
So let's have half the children on this side  and half the children on that side. 
Baby, you know you're the girl for me-eeAnd all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and meAnd her; simultaneousYou and me, and you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three; simultaneousOoh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what? A giant snake? Killing everybody?! Growing bigger?! Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, futch ya. Simultaneous, you and meAnd you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three...
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles
Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on. 
I need to know how far it is, lady!
I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.
Mmmm
Baby, every time that we kiss
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat
Lava so warm and red and wet
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.
Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
I think we need to get off on this exit.
Well, what do you want me to do about it?
There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.
Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and "shit", could be linked!
Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!
Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou gotta help the children.
Aw, damnit! Come on!  We've gotta find him! Kenny!
I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.
That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!
And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!
OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly.
What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.
There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey.  The whole town is about to kill each other.
Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.
Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term "curse word" before.
Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them! 
Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.
Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.
Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.
Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.
And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?  Just imagine: a big yellow "Dodgeball Champions" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!
No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country.
Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use some… sex toys?
I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass! 
O-kay!  Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
Get in the car, children! Get in the car! 
It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  This could mean the visitors want to communicate with us.
Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV.
Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
I know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.
What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.
Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.
You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier.
That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf.
Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. 
That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.
Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?
Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!
Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.
Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.
We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office. 
This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.
Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball! 
Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it...
Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.
Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
What? We have to get to the hospital.
We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!
Oohhhh  ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here!  ...These children tricked me!
That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. 
Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?
I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.
Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.
Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.
I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!
Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!
We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.
Do I look like I have $2 million?
You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!
I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.
Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??
Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.
Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.
No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.
No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?
Hmmm.  I don't think we have a chance.
Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.
Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.
Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! "Chef, what's the clitoris?" "What's a lesbian, Chef?" "How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?"  For once, can't you just come in here and say, "Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"!
Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine.
Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics.
Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?
All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. 
But nothin'!  "But" my ass! Fix your own damn food! 
Well of course it matters when-  …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?
A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.
No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.
Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?
The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."
Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. 
Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million.
Oh my God! We have to stop them!
Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert. 
Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!
Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects.
And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.
Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.
That's right. We have to go see him in New York.
All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!
There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.
I appreciate that, children,  but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.  My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.  Wish me luck, children. 
Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to.
Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song.
HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you!  Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! 
Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay?
Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"
How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!
Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright now—I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?
Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. 
Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.
And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.
No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?
Sorry son, now get your ass in there.
Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!  Not you, dammit!
And do you have any idea what that means?
Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! 
Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien visitors. I've got to get myself ready.
Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. 
Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?
It says here the word, "shit" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite".
Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?
Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.
We've got to get him to the hospital.
Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too!
You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. 
Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't…A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.
No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!
Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'! 
Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?!
You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria. 
That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!
Oh, sorry.  But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here. 
Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.
This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.
Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to...  Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
Hey, hey hey!  Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity.
Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.
I said, "I've always wanted to visit Prague."
You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
