Like this very special device.  I call it "Chefâ€™s pleasure bag".

Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.

We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!

Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?

Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?

Jeff!! The aliens took the children up on their ship.

Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.

I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.

Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?

Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?

Did you find out what the aliens were up to?

Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.

Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all.

No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party. 

Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, "I'm in the house" instead of "I'm here." But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."

Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?  Ask your parents for once!

OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly.

Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!  Not you, dammit!

Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!

How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!

O-kay!  Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?

Sorry son, now get your ass in there.

Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.

Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!

That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.

That's right. We have to go see him in New York.

I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.

Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! "Chef, what's the clitoris?" "What's a lesbian, Chef?" "How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?"  For once, can't you just come in here and say, "Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"!

Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.

Hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...

Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.

Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too!

Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.

We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.

Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien visitors. I've got to get myself ready.

You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens.

Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.

Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term "curse word" before.

It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail.

Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?

Okay children.  Now, who's gonna win the State Finals? 

The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?

Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool feature, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here-  No, no wait. You hit this button here  No, that's not it. Let's see.  Menu...  Function 

Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.

Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.

I just like to make love up your butt.

Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out!  Okay children, this is your chance!

You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!

Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..? 

Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!

Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver.

The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.

From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!

Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?

Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do! 

It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children.

Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.

Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. 

We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.

Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back. 

Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?

Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with $2 million, I'm going to jail.

Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.

But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!

It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!

Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?

Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.

Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name.

We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.

Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou gotta help the children.

My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.

You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--

Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?

But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?

...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!

Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.

Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!

Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.

Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!

How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?

Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!

Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??

Aw, damnit! Come on!  We've gotta find him! Kenny!

He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.

Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!

Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.

Oh my God! We have to stop them!

Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?

Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature. 

Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?

I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. 

Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this.

How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?

I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.

Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.

Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!

Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
I think we need to get off on this exit.

We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! 

Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.

Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?

Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team.

Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!

Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!

Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.

It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.

What? We have to get to the hospital.

We've got to get him to the hospital.

Of course not. Here. You children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
And they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
And the man says "I love you" and the woman says "hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom"
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says, "Baby, I'm gettin' hot!"
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...

Have you all been sodomizing your children too?

Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!

Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.

Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!

Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.

My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam.

Oohhhh  ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here!  ...These children tricked me!

Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!

It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  This could mean the visitors want to communicate with us.

Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.

You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!

Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?

Tonight is the "Night of a Million Shits" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!

Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love.

Well, what do you want me to do about it?

Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.

Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?

Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.

All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe?

Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?

You boys don't know what a lesbian is?

Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!

No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.

Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.

You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.

Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. 

You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.

Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. 

Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles

No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.

Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS!

Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay?

Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.

Well of course it matters when-  â€¦Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?

Hey, hey hey!  Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity.

Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.

So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!

Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it...

You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. 
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor.

It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.

I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?

Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.

Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?

No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?

I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.

Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?

You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier.

There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.

This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.

Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!

My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about "shit".

Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better.

Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!

Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.

Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them! 

Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!

Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle.  I can't figure it out at all. 

Mmmm
Baby, every time that we kiss
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat
Lava so warm and red and wet
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.

Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.

Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!

That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?

Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.

Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.

Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.

This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.

Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!

Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.

Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.

Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.

Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won'tâ€¦A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.

Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to ya woman
Gonna lay ya down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make ya moan and perspire
Gonna--

You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.

Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.

Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park.

And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!

Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!

Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!

Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.

I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children.  You should hang on to it.

You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!

Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass

But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!

You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!

Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had! 

Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.

The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."

Hmmm.  I don't think we have a chance.

Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and "shit", could be linked!

He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.

Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!

Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.

Drink this, Eric.  God help me! Heh, get it...  She's gone! Thank God!

Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.

It says here the word, "shit" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite".

Well, sure.  Now, what's the matter, little cracker?

All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. 

Sure they would.  But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.

Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.

Do I look like I have $2 million?

Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you.

Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?

What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?

Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.

Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!

Now move along, children, you're holding up the line! 

Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.

My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!

Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on. 

Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.

All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!

Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.

Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?

But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.

But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. 

Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!

Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game.

Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!  We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.

Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.

I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.

I said, "I've always wanted to visit Prague."

Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.

I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."

Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.

I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...

I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.

You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?

Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.

Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember. 

Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!

So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer,  "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote several years ago.

Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! 

You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!

How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!

That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do! 

Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.  Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. 

Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. 

Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!

Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV.

Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?

Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?

Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.

No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country.

Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?

That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office. 

No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?

Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years  and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.

Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.

Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine.

What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!

That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!

Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream.

Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go. 

Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?

Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.

Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. 

This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.

Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! 

We have a chance to find the sunshine.

Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?

Hey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field.

That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that $2 million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!

Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use someâ€¦ sex toys?

Well, all right. Maybe I will go. Iâ€™ll play them my version of the song.

Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. 

Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to.

Then, after a few "Truth"s, you finally answer, "Dare."

Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.

A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!

Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. 

Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert. 

Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.

Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved!  Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?

Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!
Ooo, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red

You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria. 

Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.

Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.

I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.

It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.

I've been feelin' dÐ¹jÐ° vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!

Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!

Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her.

The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. 

I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.

Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.

You have to say "Truth" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.

And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?  Just imagine: a big yellow "Dodgeball Champions" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!

You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!

Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?

Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better.

Baby, you know you're the girl for me-eeAnd all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and meAnd her; simultaneousYou and me, and you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three; simultaneousOoh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what? A giant snake? Killing everybody?! Growing bigger?! Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, futch ya. Simultaneous, you and meAnd you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three...

I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.

Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.

Oh, what have I done?  You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.  If we had won the world championship, what then?  It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.  Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?  Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.

I appreciate that, children,  but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.  My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.  Wish me luck, children. 

Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! 

No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!

Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.

Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"

Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies.

Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.

Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.

Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.

Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'! 

Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.

I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to...  Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?

No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.  Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.  Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.

That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!

Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.

I don't think we're outta the woods yet. 

Thank you Elton.
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.

...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.

It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it. 

But not like that, son. Like this: "Daaare". 

That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!

So I'm supposed to press "menu," then "function," then "enter."

Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.

Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics.

No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.

The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.

Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!

I need to know how far it is, lady!

Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.

I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.

Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?

What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!

Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.

Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.

I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-  Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? 

All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!

All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. 

Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! 

Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.

It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!

No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body.

Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.

...Yes, I pressed "menu" three times!  No! It's givin' me the same error message!  Yes I read the instruction manual!

Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.

Come on, man. What is this all about?

Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?

Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.

I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!

What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.

No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.

Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!

All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.

Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!

So let's have half the children on this side  and half the children on that side. 

Oh, damn it, not now!  Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!

Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa.

Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball! 

Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.

And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!

We have to say good-bye... to South Park.

I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.

I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.

That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!

Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! 
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.

Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- 

Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?

Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!

Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. 

No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?

Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.

It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.

Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down.
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue.

You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.

Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up. 

Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!

Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and youâ€™re gonna sue me?

And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know; some slick glasses and shit.

What?!  What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!

Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?

That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! 

Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?

That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf.

There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.

Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.

That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!

It's a little late for that bullcrap now.

Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!

Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over.

Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.

I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.

I made some chili to enter into the contest.

Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!

Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.

Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge.

That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...

Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"

Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!

Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.

Now, look, Iâ€™m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!

And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, "Fudge This."

Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million.

Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.

You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!

Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.

â€¦Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!  In the 1960s there was a monk  who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice!  To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing! 

Father, why did you go to all this trouble?

But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!

Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. 

That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... 

Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. 

Right. But do you know why they're bad?

Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?

Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?

We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!

Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a runor.

Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.

I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey.  The whole town is about to kill each other.

Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! 

There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.

Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.

Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.

We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, "What's the meaning of life?" or "Why are we here?".

I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!

Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.

Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! 

Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.

I know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.

Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.

Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.

Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!

That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?

Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.

Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.

That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.

Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!

Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?

Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.

What makes you think I would know anything about that?

Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.

HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you!  Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! 

Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.

Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.

Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.

Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.

You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Huh?  Aw crap! Children!

Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!

Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!

I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.

Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. 

Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!

Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??

I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass! 

All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!

This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.

Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you. 

Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye! 

You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.

Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright nowâ€”I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?

Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!

But nothin'!  "But" my ass! Fix your own damn food! 

And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.

Oh, sorry.  But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here.
