All right. Now, where did you get served?
Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.
Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle.  I can't figure it out at all. 
And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!
You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!
What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics.
Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!  We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. 
Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.
My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about "shit".
Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.
You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria. 
I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.
Sure they would.  But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.
Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!
Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."
The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
We have to find a way to stop those aliens!
That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.
Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.
Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.
That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.
Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?
It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.
Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien visitors. I've got to get myself ready.
Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.  Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. 
Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!
Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!
Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.
That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?
It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!
You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!
Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?
O-kay!  Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all.
But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature. 
Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!
Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't…A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.
I know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.
We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.
I have a lo-o-o-o-o-ong way to come to go to raise the kind of money I need. 
Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!
Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
Of course not. Here. You children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
And they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
And the man says "I love you" and the woman says "hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom"
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says, "Baby, I'm gettin' hot!"
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...
Sorry son, now get your ass in there.
But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.
Mmmm
Baby, every time that we kiss
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat
Lava so warm and red and wet
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.
Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.
Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember. 
It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!
It says here the word, "shit" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite".
Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.
Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.
Come on, man. What is this all about?
I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?
Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV.
All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe?
Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.
Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over.
How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!
Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.
Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to ya woman
Gonna lay ya down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make ya moan and perspire
Gonna--
Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love.
Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.
Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, "I'm in the house" instead of "I'm here." But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."
I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.
But nothin'!  "But" my ass! Fix your own damn food! 
There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.
So I'm supposed to press "menu," then "function," then "enter."
Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!
Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. 
Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved!  Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?
No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?
Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! 
Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.
Oh, sorry.  But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here. 
Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.And then you're left with nothing, cause your tinking with your dong.&lt;p&gt;So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!Just play it cool and don't be a fool...
All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!
I need to know how far it is, lady!
Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. 
Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park.
Father, why did you go to all this trouble?
Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
Jeff!! The aliens took the children up on their ship.
I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.
Oh, what have I done?  You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.  If we had won the world championship, what then?  It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.  Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?  Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.
He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?
Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and you’re gonna sue me?
Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!
That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. 
Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh?  Pretty cool, ain't it?
Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!
Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.
Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.
And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!
Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game.
You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country.
Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! 
You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down.
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue.
Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?
I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.
Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...  What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
I made some chili to enter into the contest.
Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge.
Well of course it matters when-  …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?
Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver.
How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?
It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.
Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.
Do I look like I have $2 million?
Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?
Hmmm.  I don't think we have a chance.
He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.
Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. 
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!
Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
I appreciate that, children,  but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.  My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.  Wish me luck, children. 
No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.
Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?
We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! 
It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail.
Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.
This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.
What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa.
Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?
Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"
And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.
Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?
Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!
No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party. 
Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.
Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!
Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!
Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert. 
Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??
Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.
No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!
Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.
Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?
You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!
…Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!  In the 1960s there was a monk  who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice!  To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing! 
Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team.
Okay children.  Now, who's gonna win the State Finals? 
Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?  Ask your parents for once!
We have a chance to find the sunshine.
Right. But do you know why they're bad?
Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.
Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?
No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.
Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!
Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term "curse word" before.
That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!
This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.
Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. 
We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!
The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. 
Oh, damn it, not now!  Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!
Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.
Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! 
Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?
Hey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field.
I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.
And do you have any idea what that means?
I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.
We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.
That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- 
Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!
What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.
Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS!
Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
Hey, hey hey!  Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity.
Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a runor.
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million.
Then, after a few "Truth"s, you finally answer, "Dare."
Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?
So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.
Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??
Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
Now move along, children, you're holding up the line! 
Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"
Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... 
I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. 
Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.
Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.
Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.
Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.
Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass
Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!
HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you!  Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! 
Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!
Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!
I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.
Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.
Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.
Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?
Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.
That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?
What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.
I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey.  The whole town is about to kill each other.
My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.
You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.
Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!
Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye! 
Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?
No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her.
All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!
Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?
I said, "I've always wanted to visit Prague."
Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.
Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. 
Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects.
Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. 
Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.
Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.
Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.
I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!
Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay?
Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.
Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?
Oohhhh  ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here!  ...These children tricked me!
Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?
And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, "Fudge This."
Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.
Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! "Chef, what's the clitoris?" "What's a lesbian, Chef?" "How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?"  For once, can't you just come in here and say, "Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"!
Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool feature, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here-  No, no wait. You hit this button here  No, that's not it. Let's see.  Menu...  Function 
Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.
Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back. 
Drink this, Eric.  God help me! Heh, get it...  She's gone! Thank God!
Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream.
Aw, damnit! Come on!  We've gotta find him! Kenny!
Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. 
Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!
Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!
No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?
Well, what do you want me to do about it?
Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..? 
Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!  Not you, dammit!
Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles
Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.
Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.
Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too!
That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! 
Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!
Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.
And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know; some slick glasses and shit.
You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.
Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.
But not like that, son. Like this: "Daaare". 
I've been feelin' dйjа vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!
Get in the car, children! Get in the car! 
Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?
We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!
You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!
I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to...  Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass! 
Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.
I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.
Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive bastards!
Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.
Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. 
This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.
It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.
Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?
Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. 
Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.
Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years  and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.
You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.
It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it. 
Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this.
Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.
Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, "Go Fudge Yourself," or my all-natural, "I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."
That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do! 
Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.
I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. 
Well, sure.  Now, what's the matter, little cracker?
Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had! 
I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.
I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball! 
And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?  Just imagine: a big yellow "Dodgeball Champions" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!
Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine.
And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.
Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out!  Okay children, this is your chance!
Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.
I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children.  You should hang on to it.
Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press "menu," then "function." 
Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it...
Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, "What's the meaning of life?" or "Why are we here?".
Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. 
No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!
Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.
Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!
Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!
Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens.
Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.
Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.
No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright now—I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?
Did you find out what the aliens were up to?
All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!
Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?
Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!
Like this very special device.  I call it "Chef’s pleasure bag".
Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.
I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
That's right. We have to go see him in New York.
Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up. 
I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.
There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.
You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier.
Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"
Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.
Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
...Yes, I pressed "menu" three times!  No! It's givin' me the same error message!  Yes I read the instruction manual!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
I think we need to get off on this exit.
Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better.
Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.
This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?
But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. 
You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Huh?  Aw crap! Children!
Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.
Hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...
Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you. 
Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!
Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.
Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.
There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.
Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to.
Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. 
They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems" 
Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?
Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! 
Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.
Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.
Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, "Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls." 
And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.
Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.
Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?!
My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.
Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you.
You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
Tonight is the "Night of a Million Shits" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!
That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office. 
You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. 
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor.
Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that $2 million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!
You have to say "Truth" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.
Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou gotta help the children.
Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww! 
What? We have to get to the hospital.
...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!
That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?
Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.
That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.
So let's have half the children on this side  and half the children on that side. 
Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies.
You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them! 
Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on. 
What makes you think I would know anything about that?
Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!
Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.
Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!
I don't think we're outta the woods yet. 
Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!
Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her.
Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?
I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.
Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song.
Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! 
Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name.
How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!
Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.
That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf.
You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!
My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam.
Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.
Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.
Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!
Baby, you know you're the girl for me-eeAnd all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and meAnd her; simultaneousYou and me, and you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three; simultaneousOoh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what? A giant snake? Killing everybody?! Growing bigger?! Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, futch ya. Simultaneous, you and meAnd you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three...
Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.
Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use some… sex toys?
It's a little late for that bullcrap now.
But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!
Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
Thank you Elton.
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.
Have you all been sodomizing your children too?
Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
