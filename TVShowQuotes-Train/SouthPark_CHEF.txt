I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!

You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!

No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party. 

Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.

Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.

How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!

No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.

Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge.

Why not??

Drink this, Eric.  God help me! Heh, get it...  She's gone! Thank God!

Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.

All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!

Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.

I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?

What the-?! 

Yeah!

What?!

No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!

Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.

Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?

Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.

Great pass Stan.

I specializes in your asshole, Kyle. 

Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.

Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!

Daaamn right, Garrison! 

Great job, children! Just stay focused now.

Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.

I just like to make love up your butt.

Wow!

This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?

Jeff!! The aliens took the children up on their ship.

Woo, fudge the snow now. 

You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!

Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!

Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"

Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?

Yes Pip, I'm afraid it does.

We- 

And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.

Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this.

A repeat??

That ain't no police! 

Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison.

Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!

Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.

I can't - break these - locks!

Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.

Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! 

Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!

You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.

Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. 

No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country.

What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!

Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!

Hello there, children.

Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.

The power! 

What the-?  Oh, what now?!

O-kay!  Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?

Okay! On Saturday, we march!

Okay, children, back in the bus.

I've been feelin' dйjа vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!

Nnono!

Hello children.

So let's have half the children on this side  and half the children on that side. 

I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.

Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.  Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. 

Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream.

Yeah!

I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.

Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.

What's the problem?

Chaos theory??

Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.

How much further is Washington, D.C.?

What do you guys think?

And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, "Fudge This."

Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou gotta help the children.

How you doin'?

Hello there children.

Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.

Ooh, fudge!

…Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!  In the 1960s there was a monk  who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice!  To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing! 

All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!

Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. 

We have a chance to find the sunshine.

Oh my God!!

Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!

What? Why?

We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.

We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! 

He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.

Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.

Is that really necessary?

What the-?!

No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?

Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! 

Yes, ma'am.

You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. 
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor.

This can't be happening..!

How's it goin'?

Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.

--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!

We just need help identifying this. 

What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen? 

Well, it worked once before. 

No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?

Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.

Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas.

I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.

That's Scuzzlebutt.

What?!

He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.

Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?

Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her.

Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?

Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?

Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. 

Actually, uh-

You're not?

I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.

Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!

There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.

No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!

Stinky britches, you got those stinky britches.

I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.

There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.

Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a runor.

Yeah, Pop. This is Eric.

Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. 

Ooooooohhh?!

This must be the place.

Hello there, children! 

Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!

Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.

Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!

You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.

Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. 

Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.

There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.

POOOT! 

You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.

But that's a black man up there!

My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!

-get together and make... sweet... love?

Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
I think we need to get off on this exit.

Seventeen! You're ready. 

You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier.

Well, you're gay aren't you?

That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... 

Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...  What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?

Hello there, children.

Sorry son, now get your ass in there.

You're gonna give children AIDS?!

Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.

You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--

And that's why I say-

That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?

That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that $2 million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!

The what?

Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.

Change the flag!

Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.

Huh?

You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.

Have you all been sodomizing your children too?

Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!

Who are you?

My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.

Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!

Uh-oh.

Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.

Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!

But nothin'!  "But" my ass! Fix your own damn food! 

Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.

It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it. 

Hello there, children.

Why bad?

Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to ya woman
Gonna lay ya down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make ya moan and perspire
Gonna--

Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.

Good for you!

It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children.

Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. 
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!

...Wait, what? Sea people?

A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!

Just get in there boy!

Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.

Yes Pip, what is it?

And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?  Just imagine: a big yellow "Dodgeball Champions" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!

Huh? Oh fine, fine.

No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body.

Who's havin' butt sex?

Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.

Ahh, yeah. That's much better.

Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball! 

Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?

Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!

Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.

The Black Death? Are you sure?

Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh?  Pretty cool, ain't it?

Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- 

He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.

Thank you. Jimbo.

That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! 

They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!

Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!

Oh! Uh, hello there, children.

Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! 

Ooohhh.

And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!

The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.

My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam.

Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.

Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out!  Okay children, this is your chance!

Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?

My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about "shit".

Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?

All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.

Well, it's true.

Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!

Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press "menu," then "function." 

It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.

Your little girlfriend, Wendy.

I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!

A "fireman"?

What does it mean?

Awww, fudge it! 

Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.

You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria. 

Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to.

And a teeeeerrifying napkin!

Oh no.

That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office. 

I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?

Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.

We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!

Children, Veronica is moving in with me.

Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. 

Why bad?

How do you mean?

Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?

Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert. 

If we can have dinner tonight.

Love luh-- Huh?  Do you feel better?

What???

So I'm supposed to press "menu," then "function," then "enter."

Oh, sorry.  But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here. 

Well, what's the first problem?

It sure is! Thank you.

Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!

Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.

Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, "I'm in the house" instead of "I'm here." But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."

Right. But do you know why they're bad?

Hello, children.

I don't think we're outta the woods yet. 

That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!

Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?

I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.

Sure. Come on in.

And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?

I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.

But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?

OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly.

Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name.

You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens.

Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, "Go Fudge Yourself," or my all-natural, "I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."

Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?

All right! We did it! 

Is everybody okay?

Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.

Hike the ball.

Look out, children!

Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.

Everything's fine?? Why??

We've got to get him to the hospital.

Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!

--get those juices flowin'--

Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back. 

Then we need an antidote!

No no! You say, "Truth."

Look out children! 

Nawh. I'm new in town.

I know, but the fight is starting.

How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?

They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems" 

You better let me take that Kyle. 

You have to say "Truth" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.

Spank it.

Whoops?!

I'm in love.

It's my special recipe.

All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe?

Hello there, children!

Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?

Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.

And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!

Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!

Hello there, children.

Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.

No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.

That's right. Randy! 

Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!

Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.

Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay?

Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.

That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf.

Aw, the hell with you both! 

Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.

I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.

Whoa!

Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??

Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.

That's right! Thank you. Good-bye- Everybody.

Hey! Hold on a minute!

Hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...

What? We have to get to the hospital.

Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman.

Okay. 

Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and you’re gonna sue me?

Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?

But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.

Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years  and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.

Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!

What did you say?

That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...

Good-bah! 

Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"

Hello there, children.

It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.

Why bad?

I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. 

So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!

This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.

You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!

...Yes, I pressed "menu" three times!  No! It's givin' me the same error message!  Yes I read the instruction manual!

Huh?

Get in the car, children! Get in the car! 

Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! 

I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.

Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?

Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.

Eric, you got glasses!

Hey, open this damn door. 

Doctor!

Children! What have I done?

Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??

Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..? 

Hello there, children!

I'm sorry boys.

Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help.

Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?

Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?

Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.

Do I look like I have $2 million?

Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV.

Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.

Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool feature, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here-  No, no wait. You hit this button here  No, that's not it. Let's see.  Menu...  Function 

No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.

Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.

Huh?

What??

Children, what the hell are you doin'?

Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?

Oohhhh  ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here!  ...These children tricked me!

Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. 

He IS a sick queer!!

What the...?

Try 'em. 

Hello there, children!

Why bad?

Hello there, children!

Huh?

Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all.

Like this very special device.  I call it "Chef’s pleasure bag".

Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.

Play ball! 

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!

Oh no, look.

We have to find a way to stop those aliens!

Who are you?

Doctor!

Oh my God. Eric?

It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.

You finally snapped, huh, Garrison?

All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. 

How's it going?

I appreciate that, children,  but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.  My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.  Wish me luck, children. 

Aw, damnit! Come on!  We've gotta find him! Kenny!

You boys don't know what a lesbian is?

I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass! 

No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.

Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.

What?

Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.

Come on, children! 

Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive bastards!

Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.

It's really gonna piss you off.

Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to.

What's the matter Stan, you seem down.

Come on, drink it down. It's free.

Mmmm
Baby, every time that we kiss
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat
Lava so warm and red and wet
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.

Sure. Just please stop.

What's it doing?

No, no, no! Let's freeze it!

Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!

What the-?!

Well of course it matters when-  …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?

I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin.

Hello there, children!

Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term "curse word" before.

Hello there, children.

Yeah. Things have been better.

Sure they would.  But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.

And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.

Hello there, children!

Hi, Momma! 

Oh. Hello there, children!

Hello there children.

But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. 

Huh?

Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team.

What do you want me to do?

That's right. We have to go see him in New York.

Hello there, children!

Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go. 

It says here the word, "shit" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite".

How's it going?

How is sexual education class going?

I said, "I've always wanted to visit Prague."

I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...

Right. 

Dammit, come on!  Somebody catch the ball! 

Oh my God! We have to stop them!

This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.

Hello, Eric!

Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!

Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up. 

Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.

Thaat's right!

Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!

Oh, hello.

Hey, that's my favorite chair!

...Aw dammit! 

Wait a minute.

Yeah. We apologize.

Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love.

I have a lo-o-o-o-o-ong way to come to go to raise the kind of money I need. 

Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?

Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.

No no no!

Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!

That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!

No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.

I'm alive! 

Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?

Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. 

It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.

How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?

How are my little crackers today?

Nothing.  Anyway--

Say, did any of you children

Let's see.  Aw, dammit!

So how do we get to it?

I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-  Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? 

Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.

Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.

The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."

No, damnit!

Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with $2 million, I'm going to jail.

I made about $410,300, but--

Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.

Thank you Elton.
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.

Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.

Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.

Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! 

I can't... break these locks. 

We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, "What's the meaning of life?" or "Why are we here?".

Oh ooh. 

Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't…A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.

Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.

Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!  We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.

Hello there, children.

Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, "Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls." 

Children!

Just look for anything suspicious.

Hello there children.

Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!

What?!  What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!

Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver.

What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?

Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.

Children!

Oh. Hello there, children.

How's it goin'?

Hey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field.

These are my friends, the Cartmans. 

Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them! 

Why can't this guy control his temper?

Well what's wrong with him?

Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!
Ooo, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red

Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?

Hello there, children.

Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature. 

This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.

Father, why did you go to all this trouble?

That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.

I'm gonna make love to the children.

Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.

And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know; some slick glasses and shit.

Fifty pounds? Why?

Oh.

Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall! 

Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it...

Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!

Well, it's true.

Come on everybody. You got to help the children.

Uh?

But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!

Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! 
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.

Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that! 

Hello there, children.

Eric, you're okay! 

Elementary school alumni?

We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!

I think it's working.

Good-bye! ..

We've saved Thanksgiving!

You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.

Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use some… sex toys?

Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.

Sidney Poitier?

Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?

You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!

Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass

I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.

Hello there, children!

Exactly what do you remember?

I shall perservere. We shall perservere.

Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!

Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song.

Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot.

Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!

I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children.  You should hang on to it.

I made some chili to enter into the contest.

Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!

This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.

But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!

Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.

What the hell is this? 

You're welcome. Now, go away!

Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.

Where?

Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down.
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue.

That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!

--we're makin' love gravy--

That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.

What?!

Of course not. Here. You children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
And they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
And the man says "I love you" and the woman says "hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom"
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says, "Baby, I'm gettin' hot!"
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...

The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. 

The victim child?

Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.

Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. 

Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.

Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you.

Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?

Holy crap..!  God damn...

Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!

I don’t believe it!

You bet! Good-bye. Children! 

How's it goin'?

How's it going?

We have to say good-bye... to South Park.

God damned aliens! 

Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.

Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?

Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.

Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.

Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!

That's right.

You did it children!

You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.

What's the matter?

Change the flag!

Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.

Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.

Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.

Then, after a few "Truth"s, you finally answer, "Dare."

For what?

From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!

Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.

Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?

Hooray!

Hello there, children.

I'm Chef.

Too late for what?

Oh, welll, hello there, children.

Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved!  Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?

Aw, come on, children. Let's go home.

Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles

That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!

Hello there, children! 

Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.

What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!

Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?

Seventeen.

Alright, Eric, what's the matter?

Well, sure.  Now, what's the matter, little cracker?

What's all this fightin' about, children?!

I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.

I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."

Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!

Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS!

Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. 

Did you find out what the aliens were up to?

I gotta call this hotline number children.

Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better.

Hello there, children!

Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.

I used to watch Quincy.

Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.

What makes you think I would know anything about that?

Stay close children. 

Knights of Standards and Practices?

...I didn't volunteer!

Why "uh-oh"?

What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.

Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had! 

Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien visitors. I've got to get myself ready.

That doesn't make any God-damned sense!

Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.

Ow! (whack) Ow!

Hello there, children!

Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa.

I'm working on it children. 

Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!

So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer,  "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote several years ago.

Come on, man. What is this all about?

Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!

You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Huh?  Aw crap! Children!

Ah!

We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.

Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.

And then, they'll ask, "Truth or Dare?'

Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you. 

They why don't you just quit?!

What?! Noh! Uh, did I?

Well, what do you want me to do about it?

Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?

Hello there, children!

I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.

Hello, children.

Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye! 

Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?

That's right.

Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.

Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"

Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over.

Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!

Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better.

Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.

Aaaaah! 

Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright now—I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?

Get the hell out of here, children!!

Children! You are screwing up my wedding! 

All right. Now, where did you get served?

Oh.

No. Not since 'Yentl.

Okay. Now it's funny again.

How's it goin'?

Wait a second. They've closed the pass??

Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!

Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?

Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.

Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut.

Hey children, everybody! I'm back!  Ow.

...Intolerant of who?

No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?

Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!

Fine! Next Sunday!

Oh! 

Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!

Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?!

Oohh, come on Stan.

Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.

And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!

Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?

Nope, just 17.

Uh, how's it goin'?

All right!

Oh, damn it, not now!  Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!

What the hell is that?!

But not like that, son. Like this: "Daaare". 

Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh.

Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!

Why do you care?

We've got to do something, children! 

Baby, you know you're the girl for me-eeAnd all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and meAnd her; simultaneousYou and me, and you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three; simultaneousOoh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what? A giant snake? Killing everybody?! Growing bigger?! Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, futch ya. Simultaneous, you and meAnd you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three...

Whose goose?

Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?

Why bad?

Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?

Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!

What the..?

But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!

Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies.

Tonight is the "Night of a Million Shits" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!

I'm sorry children. 

Yeah.

Ooh crap.

What?

I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.

Not too good.

How are you doing?

Aaaaaaaaaah! 

But... I'm not rich.

I'm runnin' out, children. 

Okay children.  Now, who's gonna win the State Finals? 

Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.

Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle.  I can't figure it out at all. 

Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?

My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.

You bet! 

Well, doctor?

Like keeping you company. Understand?

Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects.

Mayor, we've got a big problem. 

Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww! 

Oh Lord...

Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!

Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.

Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.

You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.

Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! 

Why bad?

Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! "Chef, what's the clitoris?" "What's a lesbian, Chef?" "How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?"  For once, can't you just come in here and say, "Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"!

Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do! 

Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?

Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?

Yeah.

Where is the signal being sent to? 

Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?

Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.

God-damn!

Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.

Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.

That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. 

What the?

Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!

Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.

Oh, hello Stan.

I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to...  Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?

I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!

That's right.

Is he ...dead?

Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics.

Shut up, Pip.

Oh, what have I done?  You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.  If we had won the world championship, what then?  It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.  Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?  Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.

You're daaamn right.

It's no joke, children, this is big!

If we can hold on through the night.
We have a chance to find the sunshine.

Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!

Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.

You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!

Kindergarten?!

Hi Pop.

Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. 

Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.

No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!

I love my work.

Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!

And do you have any idea what that means?

No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her.

Hey, children.

Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.

Damn cracker-ass producers!

Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on. 

Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!  Not you, dammit!

Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.

Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.

HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you!  Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! 

Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.

Say, where's Kyle?

Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?

Yeah! When two women are involved. 

Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!

Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.

Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!

Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?

Hey, hey hey!  Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity.

Children! Run! 

Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.

Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.

How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!

Oh no!

Hello?

Hello there, children.

Uh, from your ass, children.

You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?

...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.

That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!

Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.

Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.

What? We did it! Children, we won!

That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do! 

Oh, no!

To bring down the South Park Flag!

Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.

Oh! Hello there, children!

How's it goin'?

Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.

Help!

That's right.

Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?

Now move along, children, you're holding up the line! 

How's it goin'?

Bad.

The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.

Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!

Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember. 

Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!

Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!

Hello there, children.

Well!  You can believe in him now. 

Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
