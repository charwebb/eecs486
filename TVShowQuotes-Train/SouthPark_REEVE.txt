Thank you everyone.  To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me,  it's hope. 
And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?
As most of you know,  I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research.
You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!
Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated  about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one  can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet.
Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again.
In the coming days  I will prove to the world  that stem-cell research is a miracle.
Well, it's very simple.  And now you can see, my arms have better movement.
I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,  Their desire for world conquest,  and their hatred of all things good!  And I've assembled this group for one purpose! To once and for all find a way to...  get rid of Hack Man!! 
Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience.  I just flew into South Park.  Used to be I didn't need an airplane.
I am better with each passing day.  Stronger and more agile. 
Though it is controversial,  stem cell research is critical  in the quest for helping  the disabled.
Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!
Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  You won't stop me, Hack Man!  Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!
Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am...  Chris!
Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you?
