We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)
Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do, Russell leaves)
Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)
Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.
So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now.
Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.
We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.
(stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.
All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?
Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves)
Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.
Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.
Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)
Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)
So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?
Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret)
Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.
What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?
(a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.
So, what have you two come up with?
No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)
And people really have to care about the characters.
Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)
All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once...
(starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today?
Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.
Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)
Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?
Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)
Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment.
(nervously, almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by, bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him)
Alright, now look. These deals are already made.
