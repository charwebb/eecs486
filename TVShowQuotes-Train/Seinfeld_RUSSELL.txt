All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once...
Is it something I said... or did?
Well, come in. (They shake hands.)
What?
All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?
Well, why am I watching it?
(indicating) This is Cynthia.
You read? You read on the show?
No.
Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment.
(stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.
(Threatening) Not yet.
Alright, now look. These deals are already made.
Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves)
Mister Costanza.
No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)
Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.
I'll call back.
Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.
So, what have you two come up with?
We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.
She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me.
Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)
Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret)
No stories? So, what is it?
Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.
Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do, Russell leaves)
Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)
Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)
Get out! You're fired!
(a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.
Oh. Hello.
Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.
I really appreciate you coming.
Yeah. The food's usually terrific.
It's just a stomach thing.
Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)
(nervously, almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by, bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him)
(gets up) So, let's make a pilot.
What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?
(Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.
Who gave you my address?
There's a show. that's a show.
It's not veal.
No.
Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team.
(to George) Alright. Eight thousand.
Oh God. Oh my god.
We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)
So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?
(Confused) How is that a show?
All right. All right. What's your name?
I got up and came to work.
Thank you.
(Unimpressed) What does that mean?
(starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today?
So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now.
But I want you.
Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.
What are you saying?
We were about to sit down to dinner.
Blossom's on Monday.
Pfeiffer's.
Get a good look, Costanza?
Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.
Field of vision, huh?
Nothing?
