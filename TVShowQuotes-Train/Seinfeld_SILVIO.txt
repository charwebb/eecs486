Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.
What kind of a man would wear fur?
Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!
But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!
If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?
Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.
No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.
Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?
I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.
Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.
No, that's it. You're both out of the building!
