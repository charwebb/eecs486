If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?
Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.
Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.
No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.
No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!
No, that's it. You're both out of the building!
Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!
What kind of a man would wear fur?
But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.
I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.
Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?
