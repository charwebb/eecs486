(apologetic) Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way they can do it. (meek) Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at all. I refund your money.
(shouting) Hey everybody, look! The little chicken girl wants me to ease up. He can't handle this, so he cries like a woman! (laughs evilly) Hahaha!
Can of balls for the nice guy, alri...
(quietly, to Jerry) Hey, c'mon, what're you doing? (to his audience)
Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you.
(shock) Oh, hey. (puts sunglasses back on) How you doing?
Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the club? Free. No charge.
Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down here. Uhm, listen...
(not cheered) Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore.
Shhh-shhh. (whispers) I make it up to you.
...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do you?
(shouting over) Hey Patty. look at this guy. He's awful!
(milking it) He's not a man, this Jerry. He's not even married like I am. (laughs) Huhuhuhu.
Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. (hopeful) Wou..would you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show her I am still a man.
Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here.
