Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down here. Uhm, listen...
Shhh-shhh. (whispers) I make it up to you.
Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you.
Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. (hopeful) Wou..would you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show her I am still a man.
(shock) Oh, hey. (puts sunglasses back on) How you doing?
(quietly, to Jerry) Hey, c'mon, what're you doing? (to his audience)
(shouting over) Hey Patty. look at this guy. He's awful!
Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here.
(milking it) He's not a man, this Jerry. He's not even married like I am. (laughs) Huhuhuhu.
...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do you?
Can of balls for the nice guy, alri...
Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the club? Free. No charge.
(not cheered) Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore.
(pointing and shouting) Look at the big baby! (laughter) Hehaha. (to Jerry) Hey, big baby, are you wetting yourself? Maybe it is time for you to be changed. (laughter) Hahah.
(apologetic) Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way they can do it. (meek) Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at all. I refund your money.
