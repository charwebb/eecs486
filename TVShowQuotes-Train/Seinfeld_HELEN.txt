Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
What did you think about the black and white?
I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
How are you gonna get all this done in time?
Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.
He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?
Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
Why would they? Know body bought them then.
Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
I can see if there was a weight problem...
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
Because you made such a big fuss about it.
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.
We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730. Call the airlines again.
I don't even know how to work it.
I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
Oh you have to go you have to
Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
He calls every week. Are you all right?
How could you still see her if your not interested?
No, why should we take over your apartment?
Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
Well, what am I gonna do it in?
(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.
(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?
You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
(to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
You know, you should give Manya a call.
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
To what do we owe this great honour?
Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
