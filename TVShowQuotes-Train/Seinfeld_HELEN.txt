Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
You know, you should give Manya a call.
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
Well, what am I gonna do it in?
You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
(to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
To what do we owe this great honour?
So youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
No, why should we take over your apartment?
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.
She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you...
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
Oh you have to go you have to
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.
It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
Because you made such a big fuss about it.
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.
She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!
You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
Why would they? Know body bought them then.
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.
Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.
Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?
What did you think about the black and white?
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
How are you gonna get all this done in time?
You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730. Call the airlines again.
(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
I can see if there was a weight problem...
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
Well, I think shes a very attractive girl.
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
How could you still see her if your not interested?
Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?
