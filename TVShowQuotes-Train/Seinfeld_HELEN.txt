He looks better on TV.
Hi Elaine.
(enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
Jerry, she's fantastic.
He loves that pen.
Maybe you've seen him on television.
How could anyone not like him?
(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
(to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
Why is he after you?
Oh, stop it.
I can see if there was a weight problem...
This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
You find something you get a fee.
He calls every week. Are you all right?
Which one is she?
Oh you have to go you have to
I can do that.
What's the matter?
Jerry?
You should be more mature.
Where's that watch we bought you?
Oh I think that's them!
Nobody pays for everyting.
We adore Elaine.
She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
No, we'll stay in there.
Oh I had a coke.
I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
Well call you.
How are you gonna get all this done in time?
Who am I, Rich Little?
Well he told you about the place.
You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
How much is a rent-a-car?
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730. Call the airlines again.
They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you...
No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
You were making out during Schindler's List?
She's beautiful.
Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
Yeah.
Tonight?
Can they do that?
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
I don't even know how to work it.
Jack, what are you doing?
And they liked the idea?
Let me see that.
Oh, Morty.
(to Jerry) Do the dog routine.
Astronaut!
Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
He likes looking.
But how long can you look?
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
Hello, Hello.
He broke the window?
(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
We weren't invited.
Well you must have done something.
(hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry.
(turns to Jerry) We have plans.
You could've taken it with you.
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
Aaron is quite the tour guide.
The funerals Wednesday.
You know, you should give Manya a call.
You just sat there.
Nana!!!
I'm afraid I don't.
Are you okay?
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
You're going underwater?
We didn't know you had company.
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
He's after you?
Who cancelled?
I told you...
Elaine...
With the instructor?
Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
Yay! Jerry got it open.
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
Just like that? No calls?
He has nothing to do.
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
No we don't mind
We'll pay for the car.
Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
Well, what am I gonna do it in?
Well it's too late now.
Why?
Why?
So dont go.
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
Jerry, be serious.
Morty, will you stop it!
Well I tought that...
Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
(shock) Oh, my god!
How can anyone not like him.
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
Hi Kramer.
Its raining.
So bring her.
Is that what she said?
You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
Jerry sends his laundry out.
Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
What?
You're not buying us dinner.
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
What?
Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
Hello Aaron
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
They're all gonna leave.
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
What's he like?
What? He's not even working.
That's gotta be Leo.
Were you waiting long at the gate?
All they serve is chicken?
We just came down for a funeral.
Morty, you're driving me crazy.
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
Two o clock, Wednesday.
Hes kidding, Manya.
Ill get it!
Because you made such a big fuss about it.
Leo, where did you get that watch?
Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.
A discount on dry-cleaning?
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
Well you're not gonna say anything.
Should we have coffee? Whos having coffee?
He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.
We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
Just okay?
He's something, you son, isn't he?
I don't think so.
Oh, Morty, please.
So, did you hear Claires getting married?
Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
Whenever
Ok, let me get my coat.
Hello Rachel.
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
It's in the constitution.
I think she's beautiful.
Some place else? What about Paris?
What guy?
We don't use it.
Goodbye, Jerry.
Youre not wearing that to a funeral.
How could you?
He says he's fine.
Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
Doris.
Macadamian nuts?
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
Jerry, do your act.
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
I think you're out of your mind.
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
You're crazy.
Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
Don't go.
I'm not gonna ask her out.
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
For fun?
Why are you doing this?
A what?
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?
We don't even sleep.
Tomorrow afternoon?
Even so, the press would bury him!
What? Nothing.
See you downstairs with the car.
(enters) What's going on?
Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
I'm next.
Up to her office?
Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.
What'd he say?
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
You want my urine?
Where do you get Loni Anderson?
You could have used our car.
Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
Wait, I just want to see something.
I'm bringing it for Jerry.
Who is she? When did this happen?
Bye.
Leo says he's the best there is.
(grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?
Jerry.
No.
Why not?
What's wrong with our car?
When would we go?
You want me to get that?
We let you sleep in.
Hi.
So stay home.
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
Quo. Is that a word?
You didn't have to take it.
Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.
Wondering what?
This is your greatest moment? A game?
Why?
What's the matter with you?
Say it.
Who was that?
It's from scuba diving.
Morty, what are you doing?
Just what I said, here.
Jerry's glasses?
Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.
I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?
I know what it was.
If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
Four thousand apiece?
Jerry, are you sure this all right?
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
He's what?!
Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.
Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
Im not playing with you anymore.
Well we already saw it.
Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
You're hot?
Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.
Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
No.
What?
(to Jerry) Youre such a stickler...
What kind of problems?
Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.
What?
Uncle Leo said.
It looks ridiculous.
George must be happy about that.
How did you know that?
No, I don't think that.
(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
F. F, E, L , D.
You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
Cuz we don't wann..
(turns back toward George) Maybe
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
(annoyed) We have plans.
What?
Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
How could you do such a thing?
What did you think about the black and white?
I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
She's better than nice.
Blanche?
(indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.
But its their 50th anniversary.
What about you?
Since always. We've never liked them.
(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.
(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
No. I'm fine.
Where's Jerry?
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
I don't know.
Yes.
I thought you were getting it.
So how was the movie?
Since when is George a writer?
(to Jerry) Goodnight.
Over my dead body.
Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
Blanche.
He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.
How could anybody not like you?
(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
Will you challenge it?
It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
Dont be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.
It was... different.
He used to go with her.
...30...31...
Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.
Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.
Morty, you're talking too loud.
You don't mind to you Elaine?
Well, I think shes a very attractive girl.
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
Jerry, no ones forcing you.
Where are you going with those?
He turned it down?
So why did you say anything?
Oh, that must be Leo.
She's not six-six.
She knows what?
Whatever I wrote down.
Your friend Kramer doesnt mind?
They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
Huh, Jerry, don't say that.
He didn't think you'd accpet.
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
No, why should we take over your apartment?
I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.
We can't take money.
And this other ones the one?
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
(quieter) What happened?
The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
Uh we'll come back another time.
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
Who wants hot chocolate?
Buh bye.
(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
Ooh.
I wouldn't be any trouble?
He won't last a day in prison.
What was that about?
Well the doctor must be busy.
I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Why did he do that?
No, were taking a cab.
This one is kind of scratched.
Nice meeting you.
You have to go see him.
Ok.
You're kidding.
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
Oh thanks again.
Your father doesn't need a car.
Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
I was very comfortable.
It was a crime of passion.
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
What did Blanche say?
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
We already sold it.
Impeachment?
(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
What does that mean?
Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
We have no plans.
Or maybe a juice glass.
You have to
(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
And whens the funeral?
Bum bum bum bum...
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
(to Jerry) You're not paying.
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
He's not buying us a Cadillac.
How could you still see her if your not interested?
He's an idealist.
Elaine, I really--
I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
Why didn't you flirt with her?
Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
Kramer?
So, what was it?
O-oh are you sure?
So, how come nothing materialized there?
Besides, that condo was too much house.
Oh, well...
Buh bye.
I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
Cereal.
I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.
He's not there?
What happened to your eyes?
Who did you talk to?
