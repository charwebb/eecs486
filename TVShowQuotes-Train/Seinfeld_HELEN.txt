I don't even know how to work it.
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
Why would they? Know body bought them then.
I can see if there was a weight problem...
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.
Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.
(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
You know, you should give Manya a call.
He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?
You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
How are you gonna get all this done in time?
He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.
It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
Oh you have to go you have to
(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.
(to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!
I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
So youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
No, why should we take over your apartment?
How could you still see her if your not interested?
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.
The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
He calls every week. Are you all right?
If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?
I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
Well, what am I gonna do it in?
Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
Because you made such a big fuss about it.
Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
What did you think about the black and white?
To what do we owe this great honour?
They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you...
He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730. Call the airlines again.
So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
