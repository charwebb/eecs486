Hello Rachel.
Nana!!!
(hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry.
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
...32...
I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.
What does that mean?
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
You're going underwater?
Morty, you're talking too loud.
Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.
Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
Why is he after you?
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
(surprise) The Lichtenberg's?
Buh bye.
She's not six-six.
Maybe you've seen him on television.
Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
Oh you have to go you have to
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
I don't know.
What?
Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
Hi.
(enters) What's going on?
Cuz we don't wann..
But how long can you look?
We didn't know you had company.
She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
But your back hurts.
I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.
What'd he say?
No, I don't think that.
He broke the window?
Well, what am I gonna do it in?
Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
Uncle Leo said.
I'm right here.
Well he told you about the place.
They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you...
Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
Elaine, I really--
Astronaut!
(turns back toward George) Maybe
O-oh are you sure?
Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
He looks better on TV.
He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.
(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
Congratulations, they're doing the show.
(to Jerry) You're not paying.
Bye.
He's something, you son, isn't he?
It's in the constitution.
Hi Kramer.
What guy?
Well we already saw it.
It was a crime of passion.
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
Jerry, are you sure this all right?
How could you do such a thing?
Hi.
I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
We'll pay for the car.
Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
Who cancelled?
(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
The funerals Wednesday.
(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
Ooh.
He likes looking.
No, were taking a cab.
For fun?
He says he's fine.
Some place else? What about Paris?
Don't worry, he's comfortable.
And this other ones the one?
All they serve is chicken?
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
Since when is George a writer?
I'm afraid I don't.
Blanche.
Since always. We've never liked them.
How could anybody not like you?
He's after you?
No we don't mind
Hello?... Hello?
Ok.
Even so, the press would bury him!
She's better than nice.
Because you made such a big fuss about it.
Morty, will you stop it!
So why did you say anything?
You didn't have to take it.
Ill get it!
Why didn't you flirt with her?
Doris.
We just came down for a funeral.
They're all gonna leave.
Up to her office?
Well you're not gonna say anything.
Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
You're not buying us dinner.
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
He used to go with her.
Its raining.
I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Will you stop?
Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.
Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
Youre not wearing that to a funeral.
This one is kind of scratched.
I don't like all these open boxes.
He loves that pen.
He's not buying us a Cadillac.
You could've taken it with you.
So how was the movie?
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
How could you still see her if your not interested?
What about you?
Hi Jerry......What's wrong?
Are you sure?
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?
Well, it's not the sofa.
Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.
I don't even know how to work it.
Were you waiting long at the gate?
Well I tought that...
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
Morty, you're driving me crazy.
He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.
I thought you were getting it.
What kind of problems?
Just what I said, here.
We weren't invited.
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.
It was... different.
Why?
At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.
Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
He's what?!
You have to
Who was that?
Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.
Your friend Kramer doesnt mind?
We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
Ok, let me get my coat.
How could anyone not like him?
Just okay?
Where are you going with those?
Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.
The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
Bum bum bum bum...
So dont go.
No.
Yay! Jerry got it open.
Where's that watch we bought you?
We don't even sleep.
They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
(to Jerry) Do the dog routine.
He didn't think you'd accpet.
I think she's beautiful.
Tomorrow afternoon?
Howbout A milk glass.
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
Why?
Why?
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
Oh I had a coke.
Oh, Morty, please.
I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
...30...31...
If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
Well call you.
Are you okay?
You have to go see him.
He calls every week. Are you all right?
She knows what?
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
Nobody pays for everyting.
Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
We can't take money.
Uh we'll come back another time.
What did Blanche say?
I was very comfortable.
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
Who wants hot chocolate?
Well, I think shes a very attractive girl.
Leo, where did you get that watch?
Im not playing with you anymore.
Nice meeting you.
I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.
Where's Jerry?
I think you're out of your mind.
(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
Jerry, do your act.
Dont be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.
You could have used our car.
Jerry?
But its their 50th anniversary.
(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
(grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?
Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
Why, you thinking of moving?
(enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
I'm next.
But it's real. It's water.
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
Well the doctor must be busy.
Why not?
Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
He turned it down?
(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
Or maybe a juice glass.
What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
What's he like?
No.
Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.
He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
Hi Elaine.
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
You don't mind to you Elaine?
Jack, what are you doing?
(shock) Oh, my god!
Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.
How much is a rent-a-car?
Morty.
The lake is real.
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
I don't think so.
You're crazy.
(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
Can they do that?
You just sat there.
I know what it was.
Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.
F. F, E, L , D.
Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
No, we'll stay in there.
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
Who did you talk to?
What? You're crazy.
Four thousand apiece?
What did you think about the black and white?
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
I'm not gonna ask her out.
Jerry's glasses?
Let me see that.
What's the matter with you?
Hello, Hello.
You want my urine?
You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.
Buh bye.
You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
What was that about?
What's wrong with our car?
Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
Kramer?
You didn't have to throw it out.
(pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty.
Where would you work?
Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
We adore Elaine.
Why are you doing this?
Why did he do that?
How can anyone not like him.
It's from scuba diving.
So, what was it?
What's the matter?
See you downstairs with the car.
Oh I think that's them!
I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
Who is she? When did this happen?
Yes.
I told you...
Macadamian nuts?
Where do you get Loni Anderson?
You find something you get a fee.
Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
Oh, stop it.
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730. Call the airlines again.
So, how come nothing materialized there?
She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
(quieter) What happened?
Is that what she said?
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
How did you know that?
Jerry, we can only stay four days.
So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.
Huh, Jerry, don't say that.
I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
No, why should we take over your apartment?
You want me to get that?
She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
Jerry, she's fantastic.
I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
So bring her.
So, did you hear Claires getting married?
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
Just like that? No calls?
Jerry, no ones forcing you.
Which one is she?
Goodbye, Jerry.
Quo. Is that a word?
I'm bringing it for Jerry.
You should be more mature.
(to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
What happened to your eyes?
Say it.
Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
Leo says he's the best there is.
Don't go.
Cereal.
It looks ridiculous.
Should we have coffee? Whos having coffee?
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
Aaron is quite the tour guide.
What? He's not even working.
You're kidding.
And they liked the idea?
She's beautiful.
And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)
What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
So stay home.
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
Tomorrow well go to a hotel.
Why would they? Know body bought them then.
A what?
A discount on dry-cleaning?
Elaine...
It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
This is your greatest moment? A game?
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
Blanche?
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
Jerry, be serious.
Jerry sends his laundry out.
Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
That's gotta be Leo.
What?
What? Nothing.
That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.
You're being very rude. Come on, Morty.
Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
To what do we owe this great honour?
Yeah.
Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.
Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
(to Jerry) Youre such a stickler...
(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
Whenever
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
Tonight?
Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
How are you gonna get all this done in time?
(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
Oh, well...
He's an idealist.
Oh, that must be Leo.
Oh, Morty.
(to Jerry) Goodnight.
We let you sleep in.
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
We don't use it.
(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
No. I'm fine.
Morty, what are you doing?
Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
George must be happy about that.
So youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
He's not there?
Two o clock, Wednesday.
Oh thanks again.
Besides, that condo was too much house.
I wouldn't be any trouble?
Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.
He won't last a day in prison.
Your father doesn't need a car.
Impeachment?
And whens the funeral?
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
