What's the matter?
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
All they serve is chicken?
He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
How could you?
Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.
How are you gonna get all this done in time?
Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
He broke the window?
Yay! Jerry got it open.
Why, you thinking of moving?
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
I think you're out of your mind.
She knows what?
Which one is she?
Are you sure?
No.
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
Well you must have done something.
When would we go?
(turns back toward George) Maybe
Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
How could anybody not like you?
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
He likes looking.
Kramer?
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.
Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.
It looks ridiculous.
Hello?... Hello?
(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
I told you...
How did you know that?
I can do that.
She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.
A what?
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
What's wrong with our car?
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
Well you're not gonna say anything.
Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?
We have no plans.
You're crazy.
Youre not wearing that to a funeral.
Don't worry, he's comfortable.
No we don't mind
Quo. Is that a word?
He looks better on TV.
(shock) Oh, my god!
Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
(pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty.
We don't use it.
(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
Hi.
Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
Well we already saw it.
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
Because you made such a big fuss about it.
Morty, you're driving me crazy.
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
Well, I think shes a very attractive girl.
Bye.
Who wants hot chocolate?
Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
You could've taken it with you.
The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
Who cancelled?
You could have used our car.
You're hurting my eardrum.
You're going underwater?
Ok.
Who is she? When did this happen?
Over my dead body.
Im not playing with you anymore.
Whatever I wrote down.
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
He's after you?
(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
(grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?
Well, what am I gonna do it in?
Where would you work?
Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.
Can they do that?
You didn't have to throw it out.
I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.
I'm bringing it for Jerry.
Oh, that must be Leo.
We already sold it.
Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
Will you challenge it?
Whenever
Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.
So, how come nothing materialized there?
It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
How could anyone not like him?
...30...31...
Why?
How much is a rent-a-car?
Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
Ill get it!
I'm right here.
It's in the constitution.
Cereal.
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
You have to go see him.
...32...
Why didn't you flirt with her?
Jerry.
(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
Oh, well...
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
No. I'm fine.
Hi Elaine.
Just like that? No calls?
He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
Morty, what are you doing?
Just okay?
You want me to get that?
What did Blanche say?
I know what it was.
Elaine, I really--
Jerry, no ones forcing you.
I can see if there was a weight problem...
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
With the instructor?
Two o clock, Wednesday.
Oh you have to go you have to
You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
Blanche?
At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
So, what was it?
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
What about you?
Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
He used to go with her.
She's beautiful.
A discount on dry-cleaning?
Since when is George a writer?
What? You're crazy.
I don't know.
Don't go.
Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
It was a crime of passion.
You have to
Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
We weren't invited.
We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
He won't last a day in prison.
Where are you going with those?
Who am I, Rich Little?
It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
We adore Elaine.
I think she's beautiful.
What'd he say?
Hes kidding, Manya.
I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
Some place else? What about Paris?
(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730. Call the airlines again.
This is your greatest moment? A game?
Why is he after you?
(indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.
What happened?
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
Tomorrow afternoon?
Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
So how was the movie?
I'm next.
You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
He calls every week. Are you all right?
Jerry, be serious.
We don't even sleep.
Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
(to Jerry) You're not paying.
You find something you get a fee.
Hi Kramer.
Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
Why?
So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.
So bring her.
Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.
I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
Uncle Leo said.
Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
(surprise) The Lichtenberg's?
Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.
You should be more mature.
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
Yeah.
Hello Aaron
And whens the funeral?
Oh, Morty.
What?
You're hot?
Who did you talk to?
Jerry, we can only stay four days.
Hello, Hello.
He turned it down?
Is that what she said?
Why not?
(enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
(enters) What's going on?
Aaron is quite the tour guide.
He's what?!
(to Jerry) Youre such a stickler...
Jerry, do your act.
Will you stop?
Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?
Morty, will you stop it!
Up to her office?
How could you still see her if your not interested?
What's the matter with you?
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.
Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
No, we'll stay in there.
Were you waiting long at the gate?
Who was that?
I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
I don't think so.
(quieter) What happened?
No, why should we take over your apartment?
For fun?
She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
The lake is real.
But how long can you look?
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
Four thousand apiece?
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
So why did you say anything?
Morty, you're talking too loud.
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
Besides, that condo was too much house.
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Maybe you've seen him on television.
We just came down for a funeral.
Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
And they liked the idea?
Jerry, she's fantastic.
You're kidding.
Dont be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.
(to Jerry) Goodnight.
Are you okay?
Well, it's not the sofa.
Oh, Morty, please.
Where's Jerry?
She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!
It's from scuba diving.
Blanche.
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
What kind of problems?
(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
He's something, you son, isn't he?
What? Nothing.
What? He's not even working.
Since always. We've never liked them.
It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
Howbout A milk glass.
What?
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
Congratulations, they're doing the show.
Why are you doing this?
It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
Why?
We didn't know you had company.
Ok, let me get my coat.
He's not buying us a Cadillac.
We can't take money.
You're being very rude. Come on, Morty.
Goodbye, Jerry.
Oh, stop it.
Well it's too late now.
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
Wait, I just want to see something.
Ooh.
Wondering what?
Hello Rachel.
That's gotta be Leo.
(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
So stay home.
He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.
(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
Bum bum bum bum...
I don't like all these open boxes.
But your back hurts.
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
He says he's fine.
Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
George must be happy about that.
Just what I said, here.
Cuz we don't wann..
Impeachment?
But its their 50th anniversary.
I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
Astronaut!
To what do we owe this great honour?
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
(turns to Jerry) We have plans.
(hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry.
He's not there?
Jerry?
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
She's better than nice.
Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
He has nothing to do.
You know, you should give Manya a call.
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
Your father doesn't need a car.
(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
Leo says he's the best there is.
(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?
Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
No, were taking a cab.
Buh bye.
Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
So youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
Why would they? Know body bought them then.
Oh I think that's them!
I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
What was that about?
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
Where's that watch we bought you?
Leo, where did you get that watch?
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
I don't even know how to work it.
Oh I had a coke.
Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
Jerry sends his laundry out.
He's an idealist.
Its raining.
Yes.
Or maybe a juice glass.
I thought you were getting it.
Hi Jerry......What's wrong?
Nice meeting you.
Jerry, are you sure this all right?
How can anyone not like him.
Where do you get Loni Anderson?
(annoyed) We have plans.
Tonight?
Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
So, did you hear Claires getting married?
Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
He didn't think you'd accpet.
Macadamian nuts?
Morty.
Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
Even so, the press would bury him!
Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
I was very comfortable.
Say it.
Huh, Jerry, don't say that.
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.
Well I tought that...
Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
Should we have coffee? Whos having coffee?
Jack, what are you doing?
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
You don't mind to you Elaine?
Nana!!!
We let you sleep in.
I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)
Tomorrow well go to a hotel.
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
Let me see that.
Jerry's glasses?
What happened to your eyes?
Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.
No.
But it's real. It's water.
What did you think about the black and white?
What's he like?
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
Your friend Kramer doesnt mind?
Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.
You just sat there.
I wouldn't be any trouble?
They're all gonna leave.
What?
Hi.
Well he told you about the place.
The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
You were making out during Schindler's List?
Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
The funerals Wednesday.
You're not buying us dinner.
Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
Well the doctor must be busy.
What?
What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
No, I don't think that.
