What? He's not even working.
Jerry, we can only stay four days.
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
Uh we'll come back another time.
We just came down for a funeral.
Jerry.
It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
Jerry, are you sure this all right?
What'd he say?
A discount on dry-cleaning?
You're going underwater?
When would we go?
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
Hello Aaron
What's the matter with you?
Well I tought that...
Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
He looks better on TV.
Well it's too late now.
Don't go.
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
No we don't mind
Elaine...
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
I'm bringing it for Jerry.
Congratulations, they're doing the show.
Where's that watch we bought you?
You should be more mature.
You have to go see him.
Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
I don't know.
You have to
Your father doesn't need a car.
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
Well, it's not the sofa.
I can see if there was a weight problem...
How could you still see her if your not interested?
Bye.
Leo says he's the best there is.
He's not buying us a Cadillac.
He turned it down?
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
Jerry?
Hello, Hello.
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
What was that about?
How could anybody not like you?
How can anyone not like him.
Goodbye, Jerry.
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
Hi Jerry......What's wrong?
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
Let me see that.
(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
She's beautiful.
How could you do such a thing?
Since always. We've never liked them.
We have no plans.
What's wrong with our car?
Uncle Leo said.
But your back hurts.
She's not six-six.
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
We can't take money.
Who is she? When did this happen?
George must be happy about that.
Blanche?
I know what it was.
Hi.
What did you think about the black and white?
I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
Im not playing with you anymore.
Yeah.
I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
No.
You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
Why?
Who was that?
I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.
I'm not gonna ask her out.
So, what was it?
I can do that.
Just like that? No calls?
It's in the constitution.
(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
Just okay?
I'm afraid I don't.
Oh, Morty.
What guy?
You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
Aaron is quite the tour guide.
How did you know that?
Where's Jerry?
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
What's the matter with you?
He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
Is that what she said?
Well you must have done something.
Wait, I just want to see something.
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
Cereal.
Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
(grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?
Doris.
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
I don't think so.
You're not buying us dinner.
I told you...
Morty, what are you doing?
He's after you?
Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
Where do you get Loni Anderson?
What?
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
Or maybe a juice glass.
I think she's beautiful.
Which one is she?
No, why should we take over your apartment?
Oh, Morty, please.
(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?
Who am I, Rich Little?
But its their 50th anniversary.
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
And whens the funeral?
But it's real. It's water.
This one is kind of scratched.
Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
And they liked the idea?
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
He won't last a day in prison.
So youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.
You're being very rude. Come on, Morty.
We'll pay for the car.
A what?
Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
You want me to get that?
Oh you have to go you have to
I wouldn't be any trouble?
Why did he do that?
Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
Don't worry, he's comfortable.
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
Oh I had a coke.
Since when is George a writer?
So bring her.
(turns to Jerry) We have plans.
He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
Will you stop?
Oh, stop it.
Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
Can they do that?
Jack, what are you doing?
Hi Elaine.
(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
(enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
He calls every week. Are you all right?
You could've taken it with you.
We don't use it.
Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
What's the matter?
Some place else? What about Paris?
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
Hes kidding, Manya.
Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.
Why didn't you flirt with her?
Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.
So why did you say anything?
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
Well call you.
(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730. Call the airlines again.
It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
(indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.
(hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry.
He has nothing to do.
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
Youre not wearing that to a funeral.
I thought you were getting it.
Dont be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.
Hello?... Hello?
You're hot?
Jerry, no ones forcing you.
...32...
I'm right here.
She's better than nice.
Well the doctor must be busy.
Oh, that must be Leo.
I think you're out of your mind.
What's he like?
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
Just what I said, here.
Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
What? Nothing.
Leo, where did you get that watch?
How could anyone not like him?
What kind of problems?
Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
Jerry sends his laundry out.
Hello Rachel.
(shock) Oh, my god!
We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.
F. F, E, L , D.
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
Who cancelled?
He's what?!
Are you sure?
Huh, Jerry, don't say that.
Who did you talk to?
Ooh.
Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.
Oh I think that's them!
What happened?
He used to go with her.
Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
It was... different.
(to Jerry) You're not paying.
You find something you get a fee.
(surprise) The Lichtenberg's?
Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?
Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
No.
Morty.
You're hurting my eardrum.
Ok, let me get my coat.
What?
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
...30...31...
She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
Morty, you're talking too loud.
O-oh are you sure?
We didn't know you had company.
And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
Blanche.
And this other ones the one?
Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
Oh thanks again.
I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
What about you?
Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.
Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.
(annoyed) We have plans.
I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
Impeachment?
So, how come nothing materialized there?
Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
Whatever I wrote down.
No. I'm fine.
(to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
But how long can you look?
You know, you should give Manya a call.
So stay home.
Why are you doing this?
He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.
Over my dead body.
(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
Because you made such a big fuss about it.
Why would they? Know body bought them then.
So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.
Why?
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
Say it.
How could you?
Should we have coffee? Whos having coffee?
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
Nobody pays for everyting.
Buh bye.
Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
Hi.
We adore Elaine.
(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
What happened to your eyes?
Ok.
What? You're crazy.
Well we already saw it.
Buh bye.
All they serve is chicken?
Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.
Quo. Is that a word?
Up to her office?
We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
Elaine, I really--
What did Blanche say?
Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
You're kidding.
At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
See you downstairs with the car.
Will you challenge it?
Yay! Jerry got it open.
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
They're all gonna leave.
Tomorrow well go to a hotel.
Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
Morty, will you stop it!
Whenever
He's an idealist.
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
Nana!!!
Why, you thinking of moving?
We weren't invited.
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
(to Jerry) Youre such a stickler...
(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
You want my urine?
Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.
Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
Tomorrow afternoon?
It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
Nice meeting you.
The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.
You just sat there.
I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
Cuz we don't wann..
Besides, that condo was too much house.
You could have used our car.
What does that mean?
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
We don't even sleep.
The funerals Wednesday.
What?
Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
You didn't have to take it.
You don't mind to you Elaine?
No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
Even so, the press would bury him!
What?
Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
Astronaut!
No, we'll stay in there.
Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.
Its raining.
(pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty.
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
I don't like all these open boxes.
Macadamian nuts?
He broke the window?
(turns back toward George) Maybe
Maybe you've seen him on television.
So how was the movie?
It looks ridiculous.
What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
He's not there?
Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
Why?
She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!
(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
He loves that pen.
He's something, you son, isn't he?
Well, I think shes a very attractive girl.
You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
So, did you hear Claires getting married?
Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.
Well you're not gonna say anything.
Jerry's glasses?
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
What?
She knows what?
They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you...
To what do we owe this great honour?
(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
No, I don't think that.
You were making out during Schindler's List?
With the instructor?
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
Bum bum bum bum...
(quieter) What happened?
I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
Yes.
(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
Who wants hot chocolate?
We let you sleep in.
It was a crime of passion.
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
It's from scuba diving.
He didn't think you'd accpet.
Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
Kramer?
How much is a rent-a-car?
