Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
To what do we owe this great honour?
I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
Well, what am I gonna do it in?
Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?
He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
Because you made such a big fuss about it.
So youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730. Call the airlines again.
You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
You know, you should give Manya a call.
(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
He calls every week. Are you all right?
Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
How could you still see her if your not interested?
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!
(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you...
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
I don't even know how to work it.
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.
What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
What did you think about the black and white?
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.
Well, I think shes a very attractive girl.
Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.
(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
I can see if there was a weight problem...
I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.
No, why should we take over your apartment?
Oh you have to go you have to
