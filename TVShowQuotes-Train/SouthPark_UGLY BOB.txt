Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks.
All right, then. There's a flight leaving today.
Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there!
How come you guys say stuff like that?
I'm Bob. But my friends call me Ugly Bob, because I have the features of a deformed burn victim.
He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger thread to Canada who has the princess.
I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside.
Hey. Hey there.  You going to Canada too?  What am I saying? Of course you're going to Canada. You're Canadian, sure enough. Open your Box of Faith, did you? Me too. They can't take our princess and get away with it. Mind if I sit down?  Soon as I heard the call there was no question I was gonna sign up. Didn't care how far away I was. I was gonna get to that rally point at the tree in Edmonton. Didn't know there were other Canadians living here in the U.S. I'm from Toronto originally, but everywhere I went people were terrified by my disfigurement. I have to wear this bag on my head because I'm hideously ugly. Had to move here to the United States. Here, people don't think I look ugly. They just think I look Canadian.  The name's Ugly Bob.
How can you guys say stuff like that?
People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
He says that the taking of the princess was foretold.
Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?
Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it.
