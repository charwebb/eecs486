Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks.
I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside.
Hey. Hey there.  You going to Canada too?  What am I saying? Of course you're going to Canada. You're Canadian, sure enough. Open your Box of Faith, did you? Me too. They can't take our princess and get away with it. Mind if I sit down?  Soon as I heard the call there was no question I was gonna sign up. Didn't care how far away I was. I was gonna get to that rally point at the tree in Edmonton. Didn't know there were other Canadians living here in the U.S. I'm from Toronto originally, but everywhere I went people were terrified by my disfigurement. I have to wear this bag on my head because I'm hideously ugly. Had to move here to the United States. Here, people don't think I look ugly. They just think I look Canadian.  The name's Ugly Bob.
How come you guys say stuff like that?
Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?
He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it.
All right, then. There's a flight leaving today.
He says that the taking of the princess was foretold.
How can you guys say stuff like that?
Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
Don't worry. If there's one thing eskimos are good at, it's finding things.
He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger thread to Canada who has the princess.
I'm Bob. But my friends call me Ugly Bob, because I have the features of a deformed burn victim.
People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
