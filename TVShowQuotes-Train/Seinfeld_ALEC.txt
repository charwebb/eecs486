It's my pleasure. Be good. (Walking away, he stops abruptly) You know, I actually might not use them on Friday either so I'll let you know.
You gonna go to the funeral on Friday?
Absolutely, you just call my secretary, she'll arrange everything.
(walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.
Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats. If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours.
That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you.
Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect solution.
Those are them, yeah. Season tickets. Uh, you know, unfortunately I can't go tonight, so they're available if you'd like to use them.
(grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go (walking over to the counter) See ya.
I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for tonight.
George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.
