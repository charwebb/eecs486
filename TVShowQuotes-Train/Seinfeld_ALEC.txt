(walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.
Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats. If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours.
George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.
(Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?
Absolutely, you just call my secretary, she'll arrange everything.
Those are them, yeah. Season tickets. Uh, you know, unfortunately I can't go tonight, so they're available if you'd like to use them.
I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for tonight.
It's my pleasure. Be good. (Walking away, he stops abruptly) You know, I actually might not use them on Friday either so I'll let you know.
That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you.
(grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go (walking over to the counter) See ya.
You gonna go to the funeral on Friday?
