Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?
I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there.
Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this.
Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?
Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.
Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do you have a preference?
I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?]
Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.
Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out.
Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting out there watching the show.
You told me not to bother you with minor details.
There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, which one do you want?
I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.
The eight will get you in a little earlier.
(Pause) Because even if you have (Jerry gets up to go) to go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off.
Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash-
It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, he's got a birthday next week.
