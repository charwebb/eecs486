Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.
There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, which one do you want?
Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?
Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do you have a preference?
By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the pilot is going to be in the audience.
Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash-
The eight will get you in a little earlier.
I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?]
You told me not to bother you with minor details.
Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.
Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out.
I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.
Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this.
(Pause) Because even if you have (Jerry gets up to go) to go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off.
Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?
Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting out there watching the show.
I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there.
