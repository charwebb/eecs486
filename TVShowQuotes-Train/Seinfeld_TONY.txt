just beat it dude!
Well, the car's on a lift.
what.. whatever
What d'you mean?
You been rotating the tires?
hey? you think if I jumped off that balcony I'd get hurt?
hey George, you got anything to eat dude?
I'm drawing a blank, babe
(contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?
c'mon Kramer what do you say?
what do you say you scale some rock with me and George?
yeah yeah, you know I'm definitely down for some rock-climbing
Oh, your car. You want your car back!
(lovingly) Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car.
bowling? I don't think so George you get no rush from bowling
Yeah, Jerry, it's Tony Abato at the shop. Look, we gotta talk. You better come down, any time after four.
Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's nothing to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you.
I don't know, I don't know
Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. (holds up component) See this gasket? (throws it down) I have no confidence in that gasket.
(voice from below) George! Kramer!
(disapprovingly) Wear and tear. I see.
yeah
(accusingly) Have you been picking at it?
take the rope, thread it through the carabiniere and knot it, and I'll climb up to where you are
hey, hey Kramer my man, what are you doing maana?
hey Kramer
I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there? (reproachful) From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it?
Thanks for coming in, Jerry.
dude aah.......
Hey Jerry, it's Tony.
well, they said huh Tony, try to keep it clean
(angry) The washer fluid is not fine!
(sharp) You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.'
cool, so what do you say we climb a rock maana?
Hey. Hey? where is my popcorn babe?
so I said uh.. "hey dude, you better step off"
Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that?
I really don't remember, I was kinda out of it for the 1st couple of days, I was on a lot of medication, it was kinda like haze, it was pretty cool
(subdued) Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around.
my popcorn, you were supposed to get me popcorn what? would you forget about me babe?
no
Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles.
there won't be any next time George
they said huh.. they said I'm coming along (Tony's face is covered by bandages)
no no no no, I'm thinking.. rock-climbing
