hey George, you got anything to eat dude?
(lovingly) Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car.
(sharp) You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.'
yes.. alright buddy, take it easy Kramer you down to it George? what's wrong?
Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. (holds up component) See this gasket? (throws it down) I have no confidence in that gasket.
hey? you think if I jumped off that balcony I'd get hurt?
(subdued) Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around.
Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's nothing to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you.
my popcorn, you were supposed to get me popcorn what? would you forget about me babe?
well, they said huh Tony, try to keep it clean
they said huh.. they said I'm coming along (Tony's face is covered by bandages)
Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles.
(angry) Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from me, I don't forget that.
Oh, your car. You want your car back!
cool, so what do you say we climb a rock maana?
I really don't remember, I was kinda out of it for the 1st couple of days, I was on a lot of medication, it was kinda like haze, it was pretty cool
step off George, I don't wanna see you
Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But this engine's running on my sweat and my blood.
yeah yeah, you know I'm definitely down for some rock-climbing
hey, hey Kramer my man, what are you doing maana?
(contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?
what do you say you scale some rock with me and George?
so I said uh.. "hey dude, you better step off"
bowling? I don't think so George you get no rush from bowling
Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that?
Yeah, Jerry, it's Tony Abato at the shop. Look, we gotta talk. You better come down, any time after four.
