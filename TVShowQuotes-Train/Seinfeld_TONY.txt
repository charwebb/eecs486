hey Kramer
(voice from below) George! Kramer!
my popcorn, you were supposed to get me popcorn what? would you forget about me babe?
no
there won't be any next time George
Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles.
What d'you mean?
yeah
Oh, your car. You want your car back!
I don't know, I don't know
Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that?
c'mon Kramer what do you say?
yeah yeah, you know I'm definitely down for some rock-climbing
no no no no, I'm thinking.. rock-climbing
Thanks for coming in, Jerry.
hey, hey Kramer my man, what are you doing maana?
hey George, you got anything to eat dude?
(lovingly) Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car.
so I said uh.. "hey dude, you better step off"
well, they said huh Tony, try to keep it clean
Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's nothing to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you.
(sharp) You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.'
yes.. alright buddy, take it easy Kramer you down to it George? what's wrong?
I really don't remember, I was kinda out of it for the 1st couple of days, I was on a lot of medication, it was kinda like haze, it was pretty cool
(angry) The washer fluid is not fine!
cool, so what do you say we climb a rock maana?
what do you say you scale some rock with me and George?
take the rope, thread it through the carabiniere and knot it, and I'll climb up to where you are
Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But this engine's running on my sweat and my blood.
hey? you think if I jumped off that balcony I'd get hurt?
bowling? I don't think so George you get no rush from bowling
they said huh.. they said I'm coming along (Tony's face is covered by bandages)
Yeah, Jerry, it's Tony Abato at the shop. Look, we gotta talk. You better come down, any time after four.
You been rotating the tires?
(subdued) Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around.
(contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?
I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there? (reproachful) From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it?
I'm drawing a blank, babe
Hey. Hey? where is my popcorn babe?
step off George, I don't wanna see you
Well, the car's on a lift.
(accusingly) Have you been picking at it?
Hey Jerry, it's Tony.
what.. whatever
(angry) Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from me, I don't forget that.
