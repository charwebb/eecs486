What happened?! Why hasn't the missile gone off?!

Excuse me, Excuse me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial!

No you don't.

Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!

Don't worry! We CAN stop him! Bring everyone you can to my ManBearPig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp! 

No!

This is the end of you, ManBearPig.  Excelsior!

Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!

Hi kids! Come on in!  Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?

Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.

Back it up!  Look!  Right there!  See that?!  What does that look like to you?! It's ManBearPig!  I told you it was real!  Look again!  There! half man, half bear, and half pig! Do you see it?!

Nothing left alive...  I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it.

Oh my God!  ManBearPig screen active! What is this area of Colorado! It's a it's a cave of some kind! 

What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be??

Hyeah right. The man who singlehandedly killed ManBearPig is a loser. 

It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial.  But have no fear, because I am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say "Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome." The end.

I bet this is where he's hiding.  This looks like ManBearPig Central. Come on!  Come on! This is where ManBearPig is! I'm serial! 

What's going on here?  The military has to do this! It's their only way to kill ManBearPig. 

Be safe. 

Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?

Yes it is. Nobody believes me!  I'm trying to warn everybody and nobody takes me serial!  I just want somebody in the world to take me serial just for once.

They're already dead! Didn't you listen to me?? They got attacked by a ManBearPig and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive! I'm super serial! Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial! 

Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.

Hello, this is Al Gore.

I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.

Well, my work here is done. I've killed MBP, and now I must save the world from something else. Maybe I'll make a movie. A movie starring me. Then people will take me super-serial. 

Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.

Are you serial?

Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.

I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4.  I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play.  And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.

Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial!

Kids! Kids, over here! Look.

Something big is going on, and the American people need to know what! I'm off! 

No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!

I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!

As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?

Hello.

We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more.

Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either.

All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.

Wait! Shhh.  Christ! He's here! Take this rope!  Be ready to tie him up!  I've got you now, you son of a bitch! 

I was the vice president.

Kids! I saved you!

Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about...  ManBearPig. 

Not yet.

Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!

I can get you all excused from school. 

Oh boy, this doesn't look good.
