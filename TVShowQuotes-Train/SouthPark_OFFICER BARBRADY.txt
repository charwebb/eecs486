I am. But I don't want to be.
Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.
I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?
Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. 
Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.
Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.
Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.
Hold it right there, cows!  Come back here! Now then! 
There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.
Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!
Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.
Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside.
You boys have been watching the "X-Files" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -
Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.
Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ...
Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! 
Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.
Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!
This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time. 
I'll think of a way. Now move along!
Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. 
Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?
Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.
Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!
If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator?
Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. 
So you think there was more than one. Why?
Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!
Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos.
-crack corn and I don't careJimmy crack corn and I don't careMy master's gone awayJimmy crack corn and I don't care
Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.
Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.
Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.
No problem.  Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.
No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?
Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. 
Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then.
Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.
Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? 
Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.
Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?
Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.
Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.
Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass!
T. T is for turtle.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur...
I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think.
Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists. 
Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef.
Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- 
This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.
No. Just leave me with my dignity.  Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here.
Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babeuhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah
Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.
Not perform?  But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that.
That is the silliest thing I've ever heard. 
Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point.
Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.
Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!
Me?? How did I get into this mess?
All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh? 
Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  I'm... sorry I have to do this. 
Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! 
Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor.
Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business. 
Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you
Holdjit  If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?
Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.
Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?
Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans! 
Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison.
You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. 
Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.
Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
His parents are on their way down now.
Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. 
Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?
Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. 
Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no!
You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.
Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.
Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex.
Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone? 
Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.
Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?
