That would be super-duper! 

Barbrady!

Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business. 

Yyess.

Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- 

Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass!

Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?

-crack corn and I don't careJimmy crack corn and I don't careMy master's gone awayJimmy crack corn and I don't care

Positive ID on the toilet paper. 

Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! 

Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.

Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.

No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you?

Oh God.

Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!

Yes.

Who?

How do you mean?

You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.

Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!

Yeah.

Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor.

Odle-oh who whoo?

It sure is!

Not perform?  But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that.

UFO's? 

Who are you?

Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.

Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos.

I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?

Not a thingy-dingy.

Holdjit  If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?

Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.

Is this toilet paper from your store?

Hoh, what a bitch!

What do you mean?

Uh me, too.

Couldn't you have gone after him?

Hello, Mr. Marsh.

I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think.

Josh, I need your help.

Well what?

Insurance?

Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. 

Eric Cartman, you are under arrest.

Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. 

Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babeuhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah

Aha!! Got you!

What seems to be the problemo here?

Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? 

I didn't?

Why do you say that?

Uh what the hell was that?

Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.

Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.

What you do mean?

Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle? 

Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.

No problem.  Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.

Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef.

All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh? 

You said Buttbaby. 

So you think there was more than one. Why?

Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.

That is the silliest thing I've ever heard. 

Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator.

No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?

What? 

Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.

Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?

Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! 

Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!

Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.

Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?

Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.

Hello boys. How are you?

Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer?

Yeah.

Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. 

I am. But I don't want to be.

Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!

Okay, I'll be quick, then.

You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt. 

Why?

Alright, next!  Okay, clear. 

Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?

Police station.

Huh?! Where?!

Pain.

Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex.

Oh. Of course! One of her students!

Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.

You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.

Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.

Huh??

There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.

Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  I'm... sorry I have to do this. 

Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists. 

Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-

Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ...

Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.

Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside.

Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.

Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no!

Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! 

Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.

You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!

That's enough out of you!

Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.

This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.

That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys.

But isn't that dishonest?

All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.

No I do not.

Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. 

Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you

Me?? How did I get into this mess?

What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. 

To get revenge.

OK, any questions?

Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.

I'll think of a way. Now move along!

Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?

Carry on. 

You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.

Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?

I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz.

Hold it right there, cows!  Come back here! Now then! 

Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.

These are a weapon! 

Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.

You're welcome, Jim.  Wait...

Nice Gun.

No excuses, move along, you little troublemakers! 

Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?

What's all this?

I don't have time for this, kid.

Oh my God, look! 

Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone? 

If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator?

Oh, yeah. Let's go.

I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.

Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?

Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.

What's all the hoo-ha?

There you are!

Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.

Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.

Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!

Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison.

Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.

Boys, shouldn't you be in school?

Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. 

Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.

His parents are on their way down now.

Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. 

Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now.
