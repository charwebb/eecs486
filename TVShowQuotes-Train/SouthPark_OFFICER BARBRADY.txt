Yeah.

That would be super-duper! 

Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- 

Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.

Carry on. 

No excuses, move along, you little troublemakers! 

Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!

Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. 

This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time. 

Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?

These are a weapon! 

Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ...

Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.

Is this toilet paper from your store?

Pain.

But isn't that dishonest?

Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside.

Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef.

I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think.

Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex.

This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.

Okay, I'll be quick, then.

That's enough out of you!

What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. 

Aha!! Got you!

Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.

Yes.

Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?

Why?

Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans! 

Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. 

Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? 

Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.

Hello, Mr. Marsh.

Police station.

Alright, next!  Okay, clear. 

Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?

What's all this?

Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.

I didn't?

Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! 

Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone? 

Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!

Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.

T. T is for turtle.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur...

You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.

If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator?

Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?

Nice Gun.

Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.

Barbrady!

Yeah.

How do you mean?

No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?

Huh?! Where?!

Insurance?

What seems to be the problemo here?

Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.

Huh??

Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer?

Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  I'm... sorry I have to do this. 

Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.

Not a thingy-dingy.

Oh no, you're coming downtown! 

You're welcome, Jim.  Wait...

Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.

You said Buttbaby. 

It sure is!

I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz.

Hoh, what a bitch!

You boys have been watching the "X-Files" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -

I am. But I don't want to be.

Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?

Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business. 

Oh, neato!

Oh, yeah. Let's go.

Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.

Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass!

Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?

Who?

Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.

Uh what the hell was that?

No I do not.

OK, any questions?

Holdjit  If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?

Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-

Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.

Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. 

Odle-oh who whoo?

No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you?

Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.

Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. 

I'll think of a way. Now move along!

I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?

Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then.

What you do mean?

Well, that's kind of personal.

Boys, shouldn't you be in school?

Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. 

Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point.

Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.

That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys.

Oh my God, look! 

Uh me, too.

-crack corn and I don't careJimmy crack corn and I don't careMy master's gone awayJimmy crack corn and I don't care

Me?? How did I get into this mess?

To get revenge.

Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.

Josh, I need your help.

Couldn't you have gone after him?

Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator.

So you think there was more than one. Why?

Righty-o. 

Oh. Of course! One of her students!

You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.

No problem.  Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.

Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!

What's all the hoo-ha?

That, that was a pigeon.

His parents are on their way down now.

Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!

Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. 

Not perform?  But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that.

You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt. 

Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babeuhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah

Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! 

Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!

Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no!

Who are you?

Hello boys. How are you?

I don't have time for this, kid.

Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.

All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.

All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh? 

Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you

Well what?

UFO's? 

Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.

No. Just leave me with my dignity.  Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here.

Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos.

Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor.

Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now. 
I love to sing-a
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a
I love to sing-a
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...

I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.

Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.

Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?

Josh? Josh, where are you?!

Why?

Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison.

Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! 

Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?

Eric Cartman, you are under arrest.

Yyess.

Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists. 

Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.

Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.

Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.

Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
