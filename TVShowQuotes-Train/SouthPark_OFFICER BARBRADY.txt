Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.
You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point.
Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex.
Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! 
Holdjit  If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?
Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- 
His parents are on their way down now.
Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!
You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.
Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.
So you think there was more than one. Why?
Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?
Me?? How did I get into this mess?
You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.
This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.
Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?
Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. 
Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.
All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh? 
Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.
No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you?
You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt. 
Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.
Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.
T. T is for turtle.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur...
This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time. 
Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then.
Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!
Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison.
Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos.
Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.
Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor.
Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.
Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. 
I am. But I don't want to be.
Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.
Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.
Hold it right there, cows!  Come back here! Now then! 
Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?
Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?
Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! 
-crack corn and I don't careJimmy crack corn and I don't careMy master's gone awayJimmy crack corn and I don't care
Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!
No problem.  Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.
Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.
Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now. 
I love to sing-a
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a
I love to sing-a
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...
I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think.
Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.
Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no!
Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ...
Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef.
Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? 
I'll think of a way. Now move along!
Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?
Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. 
Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!
Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. 
Not perform?  But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that.
That is the silliest thing I've ever heard. 
Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.
Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. 
Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.
Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. 
Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.
Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.
Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle? 
Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside.
Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babeuhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah
There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.
Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists. 
Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you
If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator?
Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.
What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. 
I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  I'm... sorry I have to do this. 
Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.
Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. 
Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.
Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone? 
Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans! 
No. Just leave me with my dignity.  Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here.
Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass!
Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! 
Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?
