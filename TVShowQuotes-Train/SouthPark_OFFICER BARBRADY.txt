Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.
You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! 
Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.
Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.
Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. 
-crack corn and I don't careJimmy crack corn and I don't careMy master's gone awayJimmy crack corn and I don't care
Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no!
Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.
No problem.  Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.
You boys have been watching the "X-Files" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -
His parents are on their way down now.
Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?
Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. 
Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!
There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
No. Just leave me with my dignity.  Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here.
You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.
Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.
Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle? 
Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone? 
I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison.
I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think.
Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  I'm... sorry I have to do this. 
All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.
Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.
Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.
You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?
Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.
Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?
Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. 
What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. 
Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- 
Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. 
Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business. 
This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time. 
Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.
Me?? How did I get into this mess?
Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you
Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?
No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you?
Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.
T. T is for turtle.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur...
If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator?
Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. 
Holdjit  If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?
I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?
Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.
Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. 
Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.
Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.
Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!
Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? 
Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! 
Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.
Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos.
Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex.
Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! 
I am. But I don't want to be.
Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.
So you think there was more than one. Why?
Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. 
Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.
Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans! 
Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor.
Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point.
Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?
Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babeuhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah
Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.
Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. 
I'll think of a way. Now move along!
Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!
Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists. 
Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then.
Not perform?  But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that.
Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?
Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now. 
I love to sing-a
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a
I love to sing-a
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...
All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh? 
Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.
Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.
Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass!
Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ...
Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside.
Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.
Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.
