Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
[whispers] Convenience.
Hi.
And here's the fax for you.
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
Good...
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
Yes.
Wait. Why?
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
No.
Dwight gives the best back massages.
So tell me about your new girlfriend.
Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.
Yeah, ok, good.
I'm in.
...Help me feel better...
You���re not going to take it?
I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
How about you?
I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
Dwight, are you okay!?
[in a barbaric growl] Forth aggenda!
OK. [takes shot, group laughs]
Yeah.
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
Thank you! [leaves the room]
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
What else you got?
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.
Flying jib.
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
Well, that's not my personality.
You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
He sounds like an idiot.
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.
Lunch was fine.
Andy go braugh to you!  Nice kilt!
Oh my gosh!
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
Really?
Gabe!
Hey.
Andy, you don���t want that.
Why's it so far away?
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
What?
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
[awkwardly] I have to go Phyllis.
I'm ready.
No.
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Yes?
[to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
[to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
I've been turned into a puppet!
Hi Dwight!
Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Bahamas, Andy.
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
Yes. So do I.
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
Andy���s coming back today!
Oh, thanks. Come in!
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
I don't know. It was lunch, Andy.
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon.
I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I���m sorry.
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
Hey, Dwight Snoot.
Wow.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
Ok.
Oh, my God! What happened?
I have really enjoyed our time together.
Oh, my God. It's a song.
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
OK!
Now I do got it.
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
Right. I'm sorry.
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
Justine.  She said she���s coming by later.
We did it. Youth task force forever.
Are you in a lot of pain?
Because of your slaves.
[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
Come on. I was in line before you.
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
Kelly has an eating disorder?
What do you...
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?
There���s a call for you on line one.
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
See? We can all be friends!
Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It���s not a nice letter.
[laughs] You love drama.
Oh, assist.
[tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
Well, it���s addressed to Customer Service so, it���s your mail.
Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!
No, you?
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
We're pin twins.
No, come on.
Yes.
Hello, Peter.
Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry.
Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
What do you-!
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Andy.
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
I guess.
Yeah Jim! [Group claps]
Building loyalty.
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
What you doing?
Who did?
[laughing] Yeah.
Wow!
Hey.
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I���ve been doing this thing-
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It���s a��� ���Mageddon!���
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so���
You in the boss's chair!
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
Guys, who's Holly?
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
He's around here somewhere.
What we said to do.
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
Okay, good.
Me too. So much. I'm so happy.
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
I don't want anyone to die.
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
It's so edgy!
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
It was a little much Andy.
He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.]
[gets up] Oh.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family���s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Aw, heck ya!
He���s absolutely right. I���m really struggling.
What is that supposed to mean?
I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
It���s just Pete in sunglasses.
Ah! Angela had the baby!
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Should I tell him you'll call him back?
Thank you.
Got it. [plays word] Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
And she���s never called here.  Unless it���s your mom.
And did you get the tickets?
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They���re family-owned, but don���t let that take away from your edge!
Oh I know.
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
Oh, yeah. [gives him a quick kiss]
So far no one will admit to it.
Thank you, goodnight.
Um, where's the shower?
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
Seriously?
[laughing] Yeah.
You should move down here with me.
Great.
Irene, what would you do without me?
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Hey, aren't you an actor?
No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
Ukulele's happy?
[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
No, I don't have any stuff.
[sad] Okay, sorry.
[to Dwight] Yeah, but I'm confused...
Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
Yeah.
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
No, no, no, he's not looking.
I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
I just... there's always one around.
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
I bet. You guys.
But you hurt your hand.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
Um, stimulate the nipples.
Thank you.
Pam, what are you?
Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
Yes, but I'm terrible at math so...
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
Did you grow up around here?
Oh my god!
Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.
We should do something.
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Next!
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Oh. Gross.
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
Oy. Andy, what���s going on?
Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
[accent] Savannah?  That's a far way from Scranton.
Why would I keep you from coming?
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
The pen delivery went amazing, and now I���ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I���m not one of those people who���s just like, ���Uh, sure. I���ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back���s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand��� they are just sitting here. Pam didn���t tell me not to unpack them. Don���t want to be a busybody, but I don���t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it���s insane! I���m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I���ve never had an espresso before. They���re good though.
Where did he go, Holly?
Can I help you?
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Sure. Sure we did.
Sure.
And we did.
I wasn't recording it.
Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex?
Michael!
Chocolates.
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
Hi.
Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
Di-Did you say vampire?
Darryl?! Darryl!
Hi Michael. [gives him a hug]
No.
None of this makes any sense to me!
No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
And...
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
I'm in my jammy-jams!
I didn't feel anything.
Okay, okay.
Oh, I���m sorry. Didn���t you cheat on Andy?
I, really don't like spending time with him.
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
No.
That's yours?
Sure.
I'm in the bathroom.
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl���
They're back!
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
Oh. That must be nice.
Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
Dwight's car is gone.
Oh!
Getting things done. Awesome!
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
I know this is going to be a great payoff.
Nip slip.'
I���m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven���t done anything.
Yeah.  It���s old. [smiling]
He didn't even say that.
Interesting.
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
But why not find out.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
Andy...
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
Oh, I can go.
He only emailed me four times.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'
You promised!
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
I get it.
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I���m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
Hey.
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
Here- [grabs the box Andy's holding]
Pam gave it to me!
They want you to pay for it.
[laughs]
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
Come on! [claps]
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
No!
What?
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
[as Halperts arrive] Welcome back!
Wow. That guy���s really into paper.
Okay. Alright, bye Cece.
That it'll be the first shipment out today.
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
I really think you're better off.
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
I've heard that's amazing when it works.
Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!
Really playing the scales, huh?
It stings a lot.
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
When you lost the manager job-
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
It's pronounced wacko.
Yes.
Hey.
You���re not going to get it though?
What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
Well...
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
Witch���s brew?
Oh my God.
Your hand's cold.
I wish I had seen you do it.
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Good morning.
Okay.
I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
Andy-
Ow.
[doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
You got really sunburned.
Hey.
Who���s calling?
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
Okay.
I'm not attracted to Kevin.
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
Fire him. No, show mercy.
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I���m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
Really?
Yes! [Group cheers]
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Want some company?
Oh, like a goodbye trip.
Thank you.
What is with these turkeys?
Foth aggendi!
She had so much -
Lower.
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
Is he really five pounds?
[nods] Extension 147.
But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
Well...
It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
Thanks.
Hey.
Whoo!
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
I don't feel like it either!
Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It���s such a great cause.
Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
Andy's just coming as my date.
Do you want me to go back to the store?
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
Pam.
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
How are you? How's your family doing?
Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
Super romantic.
Yeah.
Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
Oh. Come on.
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
I do really want him.
Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
Michael, people are asking questions.
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
Okay, champagne.
Navy blue. Little red anchors.
I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
Bye.
Gotcha. [they go into Michael's office]
I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ���What's your stance on politics?��� Or, ���What is the best war to do?��� And, I will just be like, ���Duhhhh!���
Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
You look like J-Lo.
You can actually stop.
[bumps into Meredith] Sorry.
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you���re here?
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Every martini has an olive.
[Opens door, surprised] Oh! Andy!
You read the fax.
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
He said limousine, so...
Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
It's a cafe disco.
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
Okay.
Good.
Yeah.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
Hey! Gabe.
Why wouldn't he tell me that?
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day?  There's a bunch of those.
The cow jumped over the moon.
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Wow.
Uh...
Hey guys, any spots left?
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
[clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar]
Well, how about Thursday?
I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
Why?
This isn���t one of those times. It���s the police. They said it���s the worst they���ve ever seen.
Uh-oh! [laughs, they drive away]
Oh sure.
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
[everyone is dancing] Go Meredith. Nice moves.
He���s in the bathroom.
Does he have a flipper?
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
Ooh, spooky.  But why?
Movie is starting.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
[knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo!
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.
Uh...
Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
Jim. [Jim gives her the remote]
I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
Do you want to keep this?
Oh.
I don't want you to shave everything.
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
I really think you should leave.
Yeah.
Oh.
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
I really love your outfit.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
Oh!
I don't have one.
And then we had him ���Like��� Dunder Mifflin.
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
There's a dog in the car.
[shocked] Oh!
Right now?
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
I'm young, and I can ��� and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
No, you stop.
Exactly.
Oh my God.
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.
And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
Hoo-hoo!
Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn���t stupid.
Hi.
It's right here in PA.
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
To be washed.
Hmm.
Fine.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
What was the case?
Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.
Ok.  Let���s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just��� more adult��� more���  scary and sexy
Die hard. Every line. Go.
Wait which one?
Oh.
I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
Yeah, I���m alternating. [gestures both men]
Who says none of us are diarrheal?
How long were you guys together?
Sorry.
Six months.
Close.
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
[Dwight dunks her] Oh!
Yeah it's a TV show...
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
Qazer!
Oh yeah. What else you got?
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
Oh.
Two dates? Three dates?
These are amazing.  You took all these?
What do you think is on it?
It���s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
Yeah I love that.
Thanks for covering the phones.
Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
Yeah, seriously, it���s like everything on there is work.
Really?
Haho!
Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.
This is all I could find.
Hey.
Whoo!
Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.
Oh! [fumbles for phone]
Do I still have a job here?
Important.
What is the most romantic possible thing?
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
I heard it from Michael.
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
Foth aggenda!
Hey, are you okay?
Gee, he was salty.
Welcome back, 'Dad!'
Oh, sorry.
I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
Yes!
That was a really rough scene.
Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
Aww, cute.
[checking Pam's head] Yikers, lice.
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
I didn't want to miss it.
Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
No, he's not.
How���s Florida?
Coco Leche! That's my favorite!
Hello.
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
Absolutely.
I���m so happy for you Kelly.
Cause America was discovered.
Ugh.
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
Did it affect you outside of the office?
Thank you Jim.
[whining] What?
Yeah! OK! Let's go.
Yeah.
I went to Portugal.
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
Oh
Gummi bears and gummi worms.
[face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh...
Well, I like to swim.
I would like another alcohol.
[chuckles]
I want to continue working on our friendship.
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
[giggles] Terrific!
Thanks.
Thursday?
Andy���s coming back today! Andy���s coming back today! Ha! Andy���s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
Maybe we should just go.
Wow. He got to purple.
But... they're penises.
Yeah, he is!
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
I think we should toast...
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Goodbye for a very very long time.
Really?
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
Look who I found! [points to Michael]
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
You���re not married yet?
Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
That's so random.
..just have some messages for you.
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Oh, boy!  ...  What's that sound?
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
No. [laughs] Did you?
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
[annoyed] All right.
Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
Do you need a hand?
Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
Okay. We fan out...
Psst! Psst!
Ah! Love to learn.
No.
I���m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called ���pecker Poker���.  [fighting tears] It���s the game of cards that gets you hard.
You have a cool place to come hang.
What were you thinking? [Andy freezes]
Thanks.
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
Um, D-Dog, you have a message.
We have our decision.
You knew.
Andy?
Okay, let's hear it.
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.
I haven't seen it.
Andy���s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy���s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy���s here. Pam, he���s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
Don't change the subject.
No, you go -- okay.
Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Okay.
And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
[grunting] Hey, Andy.
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back]
Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?
You listen to me. You are
Why?
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
[moans, pulls hair over her face]
You named them?
Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!
Of course.
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
Alright.
[point to picture] It's Michael!
I couldn't do it.
Fun!
I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
Hi, guys. How you doing?
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you���ve had.
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
We've already rescheduled seven times.
How do you know where I live?
Ashley! You made it!
Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
David Wallace is calling.
Hey, you were in there forever.
[laughs] That's my favorite.
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
Dwight!
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
[gasps] Hello, waffle iron.
But it's not for--
[to Pete] Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
I don���t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone���s trust. About the pens.
Oh! Darryl's funny.
Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
Oh just by like friends.
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn���t bad.
Hey.
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
��� a measuring cup���
I don't love you anymore.
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?
A lot of fun.
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
I played 'ape.'
Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
Deangelo, did you order a barber?
I'm sorry.
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
But, there's no clue.
Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah!
Why would I hide it! [giggling]
A year? You were together for a year?
Gabe, I don't-
I hope you find what you're looking for.
I haven't seen it.
Michael? The limo's here for you.
Everyday is fine.  Or...
Andy!
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
Hanks.
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ���get a drink���. [blows kisses and dances away]
He says no.
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
Maybe in six months-
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
I...
[quietly] Is this a joke?
Yeah, my boudoir's always open.
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'
No.
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
Uh, Jim, you���re not dressed up at all.
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
[from the kitchen] Eat it Stanley!
Get upstairs, mister!
Hey guys.
I know.
Wow!
They had sex?
Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
Mm!
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
You want to keep this?
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
When I win...
Foth aggendak!
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
Yeah!
Really?
Hey Creed.
Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
Yes.
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Oh, my God.
People say you cry all the time.
Do you want to keep this?
Yes?
Never say that.
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
Just got some ice.
Really. It's not a big deal.
No.
Sure, if you are.
You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.'  Should I delete all of those?
Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
Yeah, have some more blanket.
Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
We are closed! Come on.
Yeah.
The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Well no, they're from clients.
I'm Erin Hannon.
Oh hey, didn't see you.
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
That's really great, you guys.
Hi guys!
A thousand.
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
Oh...
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...
Andy!
[blocks Holly's path] No.
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
No, go ahead.
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
Is--do the people--
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Andy you look awful!
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon.
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
Yeah.
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
Well, I saw them in there.
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
What do you think happened?
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g��iro] Fish sounds great.
How long will he be gone?
Absolutely. Works for me.
I don't know.
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
Here we go.
As long as you guys don't need me up here.
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
[cheerfully] Okay.
Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'
[gasps] Oh. Cool.
Wow.  I���m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I���ll see you guys.
You have to change the channel to PBS.
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Hit 'er up.
Andy, don���t go in there!
Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
$300.00
Oh well, Andy, we���re not moving to Cornell.
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
Sorry about kicking you out. It���s just, we don���t want our brand associated with death.
Oh god.
Ohh. [laughs]
Go! Okay. Yeah.
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
Yeah.
[whispers] It's the fuzz!
So what comes next?
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Hey... don't listen.
Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
Oh, no.
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you���re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin��� song.
Mm. [Chuckles]
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
Oh God!
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
Well, everyone got one.
What? Why are we-
Apoplexy.
Oh, thank you.
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
Thank you Pam.
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?
Night Michael.
Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
She always eats my lunch.
No, all we need is mayonnaise.
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
Wow, it smells really good too.
[gasps]
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
Hi.
[whispers] Just don't tell Andy, because..
Hi.
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
Hey! You better do ���Faith.��� You get me?
Oscar is with the Senator too?
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Okay.
Oh, I like his butt.
Oops!
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
He says salvation. No last name.
Well that's a sales desk.
You really think we can get that back?
Whoo! [group laughs] Thank you.
Oh, god!
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
Vos!
Wah!! Aggenda!!
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
[accent] Where are you taking me?
I'll go with you.
Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
[looking disheveled] Hey.
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
Come on. You got this. Here.
Drive carefully!
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
Hey.
Thanks.  It���s on medium.
Yeah! [laughs]
Oh. Hey, champions.
Oh.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert���s notebook]
Yeah.
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
Oh, uhm, like three months.
This is a tanned spot.
Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
Aw!
This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
[growling] Come on!
Whew.
[giggles] Stop.
Oh. One Erin Special, please.
[sitting on bench outside groaning]
Do you think they canceled the wedding?
Wow.
Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly.
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
[laughs exaggeratedly]
Do a hundred jumping jacks.
Retail consumer habits.
I was ahead of you!
Mush, mush, mush! Come on!
Line 2.
What do you think?
She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
Hey!
Seriously?
Sorry.
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
There's a 'Shrek' two?!
Oh.
What���s wrong?
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
Wait, why do you have to record it?
Michael?
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
Yes?
I don't know what to say.
Hi.
Yeah...
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
She wandered off like an idiot.
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
Oh, yeah.
Well, um, you know maybe you���re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
He's coming.
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
Yeah.
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Oh, so we don���t have to have that talk.
Ooh. Wait, Michael?
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
Uh!
I thought that's what you were doing.
Okay.
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.
You tricked me!
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
[accent] Of course, Nathaniel.
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
Oh, okay.
Don't mind us. You keep working.
Nice!
So... [points out their matching heart pins]
Oh.
Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
Nice.
Michael, could I talk to you privately?
I know.
Yeah!
Andy!
How do you return coffee?
You're going to be alright
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
Hello.
I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Can you just do it?
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
There's nothing in it.
I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Ow!
You're up.
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
He's my foster brother.
We could be roommates.
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
That's rule #1.
What? [confused]
I can't, 'cause there's no clue.
Here you go.
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
I know. That���s great. It just - it makes it look like there���s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
Yeah!
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Oh, no, I really don���t think that���s a good idea.
Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
[in agreement] Hmmm!
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
Oh, Dwight.
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
[breathes heavily, groans]
Tuh.
Oh it's... [points to conference room]
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
I can't. I-
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh��� guh.
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
Andy wants us to, P-Dog.
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
Are you sure? It���s really, really important.
Oh, who else is going?
[sings] Going to Pennsylvania.
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
OK.
Ahh! [bird steals her hat]
I'm hungry.
I'm moving down here, you know.
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
Well I have an idea.
[concerned] Are you having a good time?
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
Hi!
Right, yes.
Wow.
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we���re not really friends.
Okay...
I don't think so.  I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.'
I'm trying. Sorry.
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Yeah.
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
[at vending machine] B-9.
What, do you two know each other?
Kelly got into the minority training program.
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
You're soaking wet.
That's crazy.
Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
Well.
Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
We want to dance with you.
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
I did. I got some really good sleep.
[in background] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot.  I am so sorry.
No.
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
Nothing. It's wide open.
Hi.
We can do anything you want.
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
I think he's around here...
No, I���m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It���s not like that at all! Forget it, I���m so sorry.
Go!
Yeah!
Gabe!
Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
Yay!
Sponge.
You mean more like dangerous curves...
So I'll see you guys around!
I didn't know we had a tape measure.
The movies. I don't know.
Yes, of course.
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
Do they not like me, though?
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
Yeah!
Did you write this?
Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause]
Jim, are you in?
You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
Yes.
Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
Ok.
Oh!
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
It's about you.
What does that one do?
Yeah.
Sure.
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
Are you okay?
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
Service.
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
Sorry if your special night was ruined.
Ha!
Dothraas! chek! [giggles]
���Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.���
Let's go.
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
He's just gonna call back.
Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
Hey.
Colder.
So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
And you have any advice or anything?
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don���t.�� And I don���t.�� But I am so excited to be a part of it.
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
[checking Meredith's head]  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
Ohohohoh.
Who's hungry?
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Gabe?
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
I don't know, I just haven't.
Who should I say is calling?
[checking Stanley's head] Ooh yabber, lice!
He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
The Bernard family seal. Duh.
Ooh, about what?
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
I hate it! I hate your car!
Good. We don't need her.
Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
Andy.
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
Clark's a dead man.
Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
One more?
Thanks.
Andy?
I'm trying to save you from yourself!
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes.
That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
Mm-Mmm.
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it���s the truth, I swear.
[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
Quiet.
What is it?
Whoa. the lights are still on.
But you can leave your arm.
Darryl.
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
No. No more talking. It's movie time.
That's a really tight argument.
Wallace is on the phone.  He's returning your call.
Addor!
So, I'm Erin. Hi.
I was flirting with a man.
So far, we���re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
No, I watch the news.
Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
Ok, everybody ready?
I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Oh. [liquid splatters]
I���m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
Andy, I care about you and I think--
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Oh, is he...
Thank you.
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
Do you even know what you're doing?
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
Are you alright?
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
He just rolled out and crawled out.
Well... [Jo closes door on her]
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it���s kind of pathetic. But when you���re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
Absolutely.
Just the two of us.
I know. You get to pick.
Oh.
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn't.
I can't trust Andy anymore.
What's this game?
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
All right.
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
Okay, I kill you now.
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
I guess we don���t have a choice.
What are you thinking?
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
Okay.
[giggles] Oh Dwight!
Maybe, ok? Let me think about it.
What's America gonna do?
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.
Erin123'
And, you're my friend.
Copy that.
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.'
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
