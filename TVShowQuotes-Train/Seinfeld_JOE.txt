Excuse me
Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.
Really?
This fruit isn't for you.
You think I don't know huh? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!
You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person.
Well let me put a solution for ya do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business.
Why
You're banned.
It's Binaca.
I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see?
Why didn't you just read the book?
Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.
So what do you want me to do?
Pagliacci kills his wife.
When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.
Yeah.
Anything is welcome, I accept change.
I'll tell you something else I don't what your business anymore either.
(answering machine message)'Jerry, Joe Divola. I have a hair on my tongue'
Hey, honey.
All right, all right, just hold it right there.
I'll pause it, okay? (Pauses the tape with the remote.)
Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.
Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us? (George smiles at Remy. Remy looks at Joe doubtfully.)
Do you think I?m a clown, Nedda?
That's exactly what I'm saying.
You're not leaving
You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?
I don't want any money.
What did you want?
No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!
You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.
All right, get out!
How's it going?
I stand behind my fruit.
I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering.
(through the opened window's cab) Good luck on the pilot Jerry. (the cab pulls away)
The lights are fine. (George shrugs, and the movie begins.)
What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?
Aw, that's too bad.
You people make me sick.
And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by.
He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.
What's the difference?
I know, I like to encourage intruders.
Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it.
(getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling)
Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.
