Pagliacci kills his wife.
You're not leaving
I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see?
What did you want?
(getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling)
Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it.
Anything is welcome, I accept change.
You think I don't know huh? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!
(answering machine message)'Jerry, Joe Divola. I have a hair on my tongue'
(through the opened window's cab) Good luck on the pilot Jerry. (the cab pulls away)
No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!
Yeah.
Who am I? Who am I supposed to be?
Excuse me
The lights are fine. (George shrugs, and the movie begins.)
I don't want any money.
I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering.
I know, I like to encourage intruders.
Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.
All right, all right, just hold it right there.
Really?
And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by.
You people make me sick.
So what do you want me to do?
He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.
It's Binaca.
Hey, honey.
Here's some nuts.
You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?
This is George Costanza.
Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.
What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?
Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?
Do you think I?m a clown, Nedda?
How's it going?
Aw, that's too bad.
This fruit isn't for you.
Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.
I'll pause it, okay? (Pauses the tape with the remote.)
I'll tell you something else I don't what your business anymore either.
You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.
Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.
When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.
What's the difference?
What are you doing here?
You're banned.
Why didn't you just read the book?
You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person.
Well let me put a solution for ya do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business.
