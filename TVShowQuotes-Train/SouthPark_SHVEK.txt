No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great.  Let us not forget the great Richard Dawkins who finally freed the world of religion long ago.  Dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future.  But it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough. You have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you.  Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!
All right, Eric. Are you all set to go?
We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.
The Alliance Atheists. We're at war with them. 
You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason.
Unified Atheist League is the most logical name.
Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first.
Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being.  Oh my Science. 
My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.
So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.
What are you otters doing?! This is our attack!
You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years.  Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! 
Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time.
Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.
We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.
