My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.
Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.
All right, Eric. Are you all set to go?
You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years.  Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! 
So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.
Unified Atheist League is the most logical name.
You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason.
The Alliance Atheists. We're at war with them. 
No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great.  Let us not forget the great Richard Dawkins who finally freed the world of religion long ago.  Dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future.  But it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough. You have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you.  Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!
We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.
Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being.  Oh my Science. 
You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist.
We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.
Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time.
Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first.
