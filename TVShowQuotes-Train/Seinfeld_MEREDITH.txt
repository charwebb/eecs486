I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
[starts singing] I come...
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Hey
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
Niagara Falls in October?  Pfft, hells yeah.
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
I'll take them for my kid.
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
Cool. Free upper.
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
She's got mean eyes.
Seven grand?
That town smells like cheese steaks.
My car, my rules.
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
I am not going in there! NO!!
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
I don't remember doing that.
We have.
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
Hey... there he is.
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
Hotdogs are really unhealthy.
Just relax. Okay.
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
Nice job.
Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
Ooh, where has this guy been?
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
You ready?
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
Take a nap!
She hasn't popped yet.
They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
Cake?...You seem a little down.
[comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
Wow.
Talk about vacation days!
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
Yeah, you gotta know.
You're right. You're right. Yes.
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Is there still something there?
Sack up, man.
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
What? What's wrong with my outfit?
Am I in trouble here or something?
[dancing drunkenly] Ahh yeah!!
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
It's just a van.
Wow, so this building can get uglier.
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
I am so pissed at this company!
It's coming off anyway.
I like her nails.
Well... I'm not quitting.
Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier.
Hey, it's 5:00!
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
Wow.
I'm not gonna grow a third arm!
Ah, come on.
Thanks.
What else?
I'm not an alcoholic.
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Um... what about office romance?
Yes!
Surprise!
My kid didn���t have a face tattoo.
Yeah. Who said that?
Don't sign anything.
You cracked my pelvis
We can drink?
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
Pretend?  Or really make one?
I'll take the teapot.
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
Thank you!
The main stone's missing.
[as all agree] OK.
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
Andy?
Hey!
Where'd you get that salad?
You have to go, Toby.
In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
Yeah!
He calls it an upper decker.
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
Little Ms. Thing wants attention.
Shave her head. Shave her head!
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
I already spent the money.
Owww!
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
You're talking about my hysterectomy.
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
Obviously.
...Jim.
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Nothing.
I'll take the oven mitt.
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
Surprise.
Hell no. She wishes.
You're right. You're right. Yes.
Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [Making kissing noises]
Please to meet you-
There's nothing in here.
Wrong. The answer is dyslexia!
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
Hey remember that week in the 90���s when we got bagels?
Am I getting fired?
No thanks. They're too sweet.
It's my valuables!
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
Here you go.
To madness.
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Shh. It's on.
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
I'm not sorry about it.
Good night.
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
I really want the iPod.
Chunky monkey.
Who was messing with my van?
Looks good.
Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
I call loser!
He didn't smell like a drifter.
He���s screwed. They���re meeting in less than an hour.
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
What do you mean?
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
I am not an alcoholic!
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
Hel-lo!
You're welcome.
Sweet! Free Ring!
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
It's a couple streets over.
I wish Toby was still here.
I don't want to say it out loud.
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
Tell me about it.
[tires screeching] Crap.
Ok, what do you think?
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
...Brixx's, Carmen's...
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
Right...
Hey jabroni. Show some class.
Yeah!
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Get over yourself.
Thank you.
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
Hey, bottom drawer.
I gotta go.
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
Wow.
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
So what'd you bring us?
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
That is bull! [throws her Dundie]
Sweet.
I just like the way it feels.
Hey, how did it go?
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
I have a lot of work to do.
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
Jim. [rolls eyes]
Oh...So..- how are you holding up?
Boo.
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
I have no idea.
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Yeah that's better.
Okay, I was just warming it up.
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
Yeah. Wow.
Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car]
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
You're not forgiven.
Oh, that's part of my dream too.
Thanks.
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
Yes.
You're the closest one to it.
Wait, this is the entertainment?
Oh, that's what they call it.
Better.
I really want to come out!
What do we get if we do 'em?
I don't remember.
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
Damn it.
Yeah.
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
Did you hear anything yet?
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
No, I... I get it. It's funny.
Hey, this ain't no Breakfast Club, bitch.
Me.
Yeah right. With slammin��� bods like that, they ain���t playing checkers.
Tell us the freaking story!
Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.
Not yet!
[shocked expression]
Thanks for bringing that up.
When are you gonna boom me?
Yeah.
Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?
Wow!
How about a threesome?
Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.
Whoa!
What was your cell like?
...The Fort, Andy Gavin's.
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
[takes mug] Yes.
No, I get it.
Oh, right.
You hit me with your car!
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
What the hell, Toby?
Hurry up already.
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
That was in your way?
I didn't want you it!
What���s with the blanket?
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
[breaks into the car] I'm in.
What are we gonna do?
Annoying.
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
Hey! No way!
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.
Wait. Seriously?!
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...
Man, he���s really in twinkle town now.
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
How am I supposed to know what that is?
Boom!
Like Clooney.
Slip.
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
Sure!  That sounds fun!
Nice accent.  You sound like Forrest Gump.
Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed.
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
Tear up the carpet!
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Stop baggin��� my head!
This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
Crap. Sorry, Nellie.
The weekend!
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
NO!!!
Ass...turd.
I have a shirt like that in my car.
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
How does one get a point?
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
Wow.
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
Fine, just give it.
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
Who gives a f[bleep]?
That scowl.
I am...
Oh! Surprise.
Whoo-hoo. Let���s get this party started!
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
Just? Just what? Just forgot?
[British accent] Hello.
Yes.
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
Maybe watch a movie...under a blanket...
Yeah, it makes me sick.
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
Anyway, I have this Sharpie...
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
What is the status on my wish?
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
SHUT UP ANGELA!
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
A little better. I threw up.
What?
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
The Murphy bed of my basement.
No way!  There is no way! No way!
Maybe it wasn't.
Yeah.  Jack, these are my co-workers.
Yahtzee.
Hey, where is the steak sauce?
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela���s throat]
I can't eat dairy.
Um, I forgot my...
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
Make your own [bleep]in' sandwich.
I really prefer devils food cake.
How much?
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
Wow!
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
Damn it.
One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
Suck it Oscar.
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
Lose weight.
Hey Michael.
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
At the same time.
Yeah... all right.
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
Well, it must have just opened up.
I can't believe he has a second job.
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
No duh. Let's go. You're buying.
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
[raises hand] I want to.
I hate that.
This is weird.
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
Hey, boom guy.
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
[looks at ring, whispering] Wow...
Turn around.
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
Take a picture. It will last longer.
Hey, what you doing right now?
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
Sure.
Forget about it.
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
And a rat. Separate occasions.
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim]
Don't pull any plugs.
Darryl!
Shut it, Angela.
Okay. [remains sitting]
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Is that a threat?
Shut up. Jakey?
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
It didn't get torn off?
Hey, champagne.
Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
I'm a hobo.
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
Yes.
Awesome!
That apple looks delic!
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
Me. Please.
Dwight, what the hell?
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
It's no problem. You live right near me.
Frickin��� A!
You know it.  I am never getting married.
Three hundred and five.
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
Hi, Pam.
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
We just missed Poor Richards.
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
What?
Four-oh-two.
Uh, I can't. Um...
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
[quickly] Erotic.
That is something I would never do.
Yup, just a cold sore.
She could be your soul mate.
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
���Suck it losers.���
Uh, we have. Countless times.
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
Sure.
No, I...I get it. It's funny.
How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
Speech!
Piss or get off the pot!
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
Gerty's.
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...
Ow! Take it easy.
Hi.
Pam failed art school.
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
Uh, I also don't see Andy.
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
I know I drink. I like to party
That's cool.
Angela, what kind of music?
You have to! [everyone grumbling]
Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
Really?
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don't need to tell me.
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Got it.
Forget you.
Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
Please don't tell a sailor joke.
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Good-timers follow me.
Yeh, they're rich.
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Hey!
I think it looks good.
[screams]
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
We're both girls. Who cares?
Yes.
[eating hot dog] What is it?
Do it!
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
Topless Christmas.
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
Sure.
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
Are you sure?
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
Ow.
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
That���s cheating.
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
Whoo! Brought some brain food.
