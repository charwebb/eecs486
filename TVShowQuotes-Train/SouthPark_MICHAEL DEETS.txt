You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness.
Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds.
That's it, no more pictures.  Time to die.
But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!
And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim.
Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation!  This... is me at the grand canyon.  Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore  Do you see?
Your hand will be one with the others.
They're never gonna catch the serial killer. He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties? 
You are obviously a big fan of my work.
Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio.  This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see?!
