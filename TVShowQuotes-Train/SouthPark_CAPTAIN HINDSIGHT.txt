Please, sit down. What can I do for you?

Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?

Of what?

'Course it's Courtney Love!

They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to.  Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone! 

Wha-? What is your power?

Seriously, what should I do?

I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!

I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.

Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.

I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!

Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.

Go ahead.

Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?

Alright enough! What's going on?!

You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love!

No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!

Don't anybody move!  So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me!

Look at those photos on the desk. 

Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!

My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!

And then you see that building to the left?

Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!

What seems to be the problem?

Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it.

Should I get back in the chair? Remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter? 

Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!

What's the skinny?

Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  It's not a blessing, it's a curse.

It's not Courtney Love?

Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened.

NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!

It doesn't matter.  Even if the pictures are fake. I can't take it anymore.  Do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20/20 hindsight?  As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore!

Get this kid out of here! I have to think!

It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!

Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?
