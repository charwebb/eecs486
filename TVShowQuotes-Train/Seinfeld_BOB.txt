Excuse me, do you work here?
Who! Who is burning the flag?!
Well you already said spite so......
What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.
Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)
You bastard! You hid the suit.
Him?!
Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?
Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.
(cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?
(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
Ah, could you repeat that?
Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.
Where is it? Where is it?
So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
I'm buying the suit.
Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!
Just pick it up.
I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!
Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
(to Elaine) Just wanted to say hi.
Thanks. Hi everybody.
Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there.
. Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this number.
Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven.
Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
Then what the hell business is it of yours?
No...you said spite...Too late.
This Monday?
Look, you wanna get hurt?
Hi.
You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
It's an antique.
These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
What seems to be the problem?
Really?
Well.....
That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
(apologetic) I..I'm sorry. What?
Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!
