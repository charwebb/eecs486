Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
It's an antique.
Ah, could you repeat that?
(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.
What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.
Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?
What seems to be the problem?
But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!
This Monday?
I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
Then what the hell business is it of yours?
I'm buying the suit.
Him?!
Look, you wanna get hurt?
You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
You think so? (she nods and walks away)
Nicole Millers, We're not expecting any Nicole Millers, in fact we have too many as it is.
Hi.
You bastard! You hid the suit.
(cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?
Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.
Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!
Excuse me, do you work here?
Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)
Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
(apologetic) I..I'm sorry. What?
Who! Who is burning the flag?!
Where is it? Where is it?
That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!
Thanks. Hi everybody.
Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there.
Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.
Just pick it up.
No...you said spite...Too late.
Really?
Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven.
