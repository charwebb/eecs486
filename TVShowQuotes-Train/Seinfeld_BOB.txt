You think so? (she nods and walks away)
You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?
Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.
These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven.
Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!
Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there.
(cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?
What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
Then what the hell business is it of yours?
That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
. Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this number.
Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!
I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.
Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)
Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.
(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!
Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.
But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
