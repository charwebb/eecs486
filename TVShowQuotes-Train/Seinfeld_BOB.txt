You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.
Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)
Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!
I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?
Then what the hell business is it of yours?
That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
Nicole Millers, We're not expecting any Nicole Millers, in fact we have too many as it is.

But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
You think so? (she nods and walks away)
Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.
What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!
(cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?
. Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this number.
Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven.
Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!
Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.
