What seems to be the problem?
I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!
Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.
This Monday?
Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.
Look, you wanna get hurt?
But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
I'm buying the suit.
Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!
Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven.
(cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?
So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
(apologetic) I..I'm sorry. What?
Then what the hell business is it of yours?
Where is it? Where is it?
Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!
I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
No...you said spite...Too late.
Well.....
Really?
(to Elaine) Just wanted to say hi.
Who! Who is burning the flag?!
Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there.
Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
You think so? (she nods and walks away)
Excuse me, do you work here?
Well you already said spite so......
Ah, could you repeat that?
You bastard! You hid the suit.
Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)
. Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this number.
You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
Thanks. Hi everybody.
Hi.
Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.
Him?!
It's an antique.
What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
