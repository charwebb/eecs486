Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
What seems to be the problem?
Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)
Then what the hell business is it of yours?
(cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?
Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!
I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.
Well.....
Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.
I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!
Where is it? Where is it?
You think so? (she nods and walks away)
Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.
Ah, could you repeat that?
No...you said spite...Too late.
Hi.
This Monday?
You bastard! You hid the suit.
Just pick it up.
Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?
You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.
Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
Look, you wanna get hurt?
Excuse me, do you work here?
Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven.
I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there.
(to Elaine) Just wanted to say hi.
But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
It's an antique.
That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
Thanks. Hi everybody.
Who! Who is burning the flag?!
Well you already said spite so......
Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!
. Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this number.
So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
Nicole Millers, We're not expecting any Nicole Millers, in fact we have too many as it is.
(apologetic) I..I'm sorry. What?
