You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
It just feels like a slap in the face.
He said he wanted me there for support.
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
I think the problem with this office is that
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
Who are you dating in the public arena?
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
I am dying to know what's in there.
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
How long do you think a week is?
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
Why would you throw something wet at me?
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
And get you the hell outta that place.
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
He literally won't come out of his office.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
Do you know how to do an intervention?
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
It starts on it's own. Let it -
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
No one else in this office is gay.
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
He's not even good at his first one.
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
That's as simple as I can make it.
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
And that's how the printing press was invented.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
This is a lot of credit card debt.
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
I can help out, if you need me.
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
You know I don't like to participate in the...
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
I think you don't know what you're saying.
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
All right. I can do that. Then what?
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
You're not sure that you have the job.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
