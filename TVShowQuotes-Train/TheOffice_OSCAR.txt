So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
Who are you dating in the public arena?
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
And that's how the printing press was invented.
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
I can help out, if you need me.
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
You know I don't like to participate in the...
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
How long do you think a week is?
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
What time do we have to come in?
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
I think the problem with this office is that
And get you the hell outta that place.
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
No one else in this office is gay.
I think you don't know what you're saying.
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
All right. I can do that. Then what?
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
Why would you throw something wet at me?
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
He literally won't come out of his office.
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
It starts on it's own. Let it -
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
He's not even good at his first one.
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
He said he wanted me there for support.
That's as simple as I can make it.
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
Do you know how to do an intervention?
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
This is a lot of credit card debt.
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
I am dying to know what's in there.
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
You're not sure that you have the job.
