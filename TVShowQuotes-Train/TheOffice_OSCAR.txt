I promised I wouldn't tell.
Sure. Hoops!
No, I have not.
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
You did it, Kevin.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
Sweet!
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
El telefono.
Pair of shoes!
She's always late, she's always rude...
What's the next one?
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
What happened to Phyllis?
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
Yeah.  [Oscar gets up and walks out]
Michael. Reading.
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
Michael --
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
It's not that kind of ladle.
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
Okay, good, okay.  What bank?
I can't believe this is really happening.
Ah, I'll just... wait for him.
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
Thank you David.
My mom. [puts card in pocket]
Yes, I'm gay.
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
That's too funny.
I jus... I just need a signature.
Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.
Wow.
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
I have a very strong suspicion.
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
okay
Andy, no-
Well...
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
How do you even know they're gay?
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
Role call.
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
All right.
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
I'm messing with you, Holly.
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
Hey, Michael.
That���s enough Kevin.
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
It was an amateur production, technically.
We are together. Romantically.
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
The note.  So 'holier than thou'.
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
Andy. That is her private property.
Ow! Robert?!
Yeah.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
������C-SPAN���?
No thank you.
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
Oh, that's very funny.
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
Hey Michael.
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Is that a volunteer program or���
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
Who's the senator?
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
We knew. Ryan told us.
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
Well, it's-
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
How?
Turkey is a healthy meat.
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
Good luck!
What's up, Pam?
Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
Why?
Oh!
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
That reeks, and I'm trying to eat.
Salman Rushdie.
You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
I'll get him water.
What are you doing?
I just told them to do it!
[everyone talking to the camera] Just--
Pam... I think Robert is gay.
No. [shakes head back and forth]
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
Yeah.
What did you end up with?
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
Yeah, now it doesn't make any sense.
Dunder Mifflin.
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
Where did you get this?
Yes!
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
No!
Why would you throw something wet at me?
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
Why are we doing this?
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
Dumpster Man.
[Kelly faints] Oh!
Yeah, yeah.
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
Michael? Poor Richard's?
No, they just made out.  That's it.
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
These questions are bush league.
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
They
Oh, my goodness.
It's just...
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
Kevin, c'mon.
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
Merry Christmas to you.
Who?
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
Because I'm gay?
I cannot believe how condescending Andy's being.
Can you believe this?
Wow.
Kelly's on your side.
Wow.  Now we can afford hard-cover books.
What?!
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
What was that?
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Well, I bet it was a smash.
Maybe you're right, who are we to...
Those guys always change back, Angela.
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
Mmm.
He���s fine.
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
You're a saint, Pam.
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
I brought you a cookie.
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
So happy hour.
I have a question.
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
Let it ride. Let it all ride.
Now? It's our Christmas party.
Angela!
Hold on, hold on, what's going on?
I'm good.
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
I'm in.
Ok...
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
He knew!
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
Alright. Alright I get it.
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
What is this about?
You put a note in my food?
I was in the middle of something.
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
Oh my. That is small.
Bankruptcy?
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
How old is she?
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
Exactly, Andy.
Who is this guy again?
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
you are incorrigible!
Oh my God, what happened?
Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying.
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
Wow, it's so... healthy.
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty.
Dwight please!
What is this?
I'm just curious.
It's not fair, you guys.
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
Ok!
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
I had a good time too.
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Yeah, brosef.
No, guys.
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
Hey, we're going with the chairs.
This is not good.
What is this?
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
[with horns honking] Kevin, can-
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
Can't you just tell us.
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
You have a brother?
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
I think the problem with this office is that
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
Definitely no.
Hey, Dwight.
Ooh.
What?
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
How long do you take to pee?
What's your point.
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs]
Oh, I���m sure ...that���s nothing.
Good morning. [clears throat]
What are you implying?
Michael, I don't know what to say.
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
You���re back?
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
I, uh, huh, just [chuckles nervously]
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
Sure.
Everybody shut up and work!
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
Probably went to his head.
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
No.
I never suggested...
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
They finally let you do it!
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
I'll check us in.
Right there.
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
Thank you.
Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.
[sees wine collection] Holy cow!
Why won't you do Andy?
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
[laughs]
You're not sure that you have the job.
Those figures I gave you? They're false.
Is that Chet Montgomery?
Yes, they can.
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
He literally won't come out of his office.
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
Kevin!
Like what?
...Andy.
Hey.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
Dwight.
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
[on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
Someone please explain it to Kevin.
Ok. I got one.
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
I'm on the phone.
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
So...
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
No! Come on!
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Knock, knock. Oh!
Why'd you say dollars?
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
But you just!
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
Hoop it up, right.
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
Here you go, Creed.
You call him!
How old is she?
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
No.
Angela, it���s a lead freaking pipe.
Michael, if I gave you...
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
Hi.
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
I would rather not.
Ten percent?
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
Yes! The freaking PDA!
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
Angela, you still have your son.
It's gonna hurt.
I'd love to talk more about it.
What have you been doing?
Where are you getting this information?
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?
Mm-hmm.
Here.
Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
Try another sentence.
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
Because we're looking up jail time.
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
Pam's first celebrity crush.
Tasteless.
These wings are all fat and bone.
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
I have the chills.
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
I don't think so.
Go to the recorded version.
Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
Huh?
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
Jim what are you doing?
Use it in a sentence.
Hey.
Fine.
Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin]
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
When is the funeral?
Yeah?
Stop hitting me!
Ah...
Well...
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
Great.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
I can't.
I���m so sorry. Angela--
Go ahead.
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
Again, that gives us no information.
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Elliot!
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Meredith, I-
[laughs] That's disgusting.
So what do you think?
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
I don't know.
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
Congratulations.  That's great.
We'll miss you.
What?
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
[whispers] So!?
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
That's funny.
Okay.
You wanted to see me?
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
Are you guys listening to this?
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
Yes.
Michael I need to talk to you.
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
Okay, this is much worse than before.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
Are you going to tell Michael?
Still, that's not anything.
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
It's just not prudent Michael.
Yeah sure.
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
Guys! Over here, we found the bus.
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
What's going on?
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
Do you know how to do an intervention?
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
Como estas, senor?
That's... that's... that's very generous.
She has to know.
Michael, can I talk to you?
Stanley, could you look up 'accomplices'?
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim]
I don't know.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
That's no accident.
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
Oh. [fixes his dress]
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
Oh... hey.
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
How does that even compare?
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
Bye.
It could be snacks, or-
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
What? No!
Yes, he's innocent.
Yeah.
Would you, please? Please.
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
No.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
That's great.
Will you marry me?
Good luck.
Skin cancer is treatable.
What?
We do a lot more than that.
What?
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
What part Native American?
Right.
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
WASSUUUUP! [laughing]
What about February 2nd?
What are you doing?
Pam, what can be done?
If you don't mind me asking---
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
Or moon.
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
Ah! My hand!  That's hot!
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
He put me here.
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
Andy, something is wrong with that woman.
It's not pizza.
Kevin.
Good.
Meredith, don't.
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
That's the original.
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
I'm in.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
You���re not gay.
Thank you.
Aah!
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
This is a lot of credit card debt.
Yes, it is.
Well���
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
More or less.
Put the 'q' there, sweetie.
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
We were never lovers!
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
...I'll do it.
She's the one.
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Yeah.
Hey, everyone.
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
You have an address yet in Colorado?
That's great, man.
What?
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
Do you know?
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
A triple word.
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
That's really not our job.
Yes.
No, thank you, Angela.
Yes, yes, absolutely.
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
Can you breathe okay?
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
Thank God.
At least.
Michael, Michael I... [blinds rustle] ... inside.
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
Who are you dating in the public arena?
They can.
Un-be-liev-a-ble.
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
We can stay a little longer.
Yep, here they are.
I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Home is where the
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
he's a historian.
I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
Oh, you think it's a choice?
No, I just like tea.
Great, they stole my laptop.
Whoo, whoo, whoo.
Maybe over some coffee later?
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
That���s���that���s awful, Angela. I���m so sorry.
What time do we have to come in?
The Atlantic.
YOLO! [singing and dancing]
This is nuts.
Why do you say that?
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
How 'bout, she takes it down?
Michael, why?
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Andy bought lunch.
Ok, that's a joke.
He's on one of his honeymoons.
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
Stanley.
OK, the health care plan.
Just- no.  No.
No, that's a flush.
Where was that.
[rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat.
It's, it's a completely different name!
I should step into sales myself.
I don't think he meant, that--
You owe me and apology.
Hi.
Shh!
Hello.
Oh...
It was crazy.
Andy. [alert sounds]
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
It's not that funny.
Flip it back please.
You're forty-three.  Mick Jagger's like sixty-five.
Have you been to the beach yet?
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
To both these bears.
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
[chuckling] Isn't it a seven-hour drive?
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
So Michael, what do you think?
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
Funny Jim. That is funny.
They're our largest client.
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
You got a bonus check?
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
Is there a front runner?
There is no story.
Jan.
Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
Erin, what are you doing?
You're gonna get us a copier then?
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
Erin-
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
What town do Holly's parents live in?
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
There he is.
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
Thank you, Michael.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
You're waterboarding me!
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
Yeah.
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
Donate to the charity?
I don't think so.
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
Thank... Yeah...
No horseplay.
Um..
Okay Pam.
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
And that's how the printing press was invented.
Alright.
All right, Meredith.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
They caught us kissing on Halloween.
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
Perfect.
I saw it.
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
It wasn't me.
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
I have no idea.
Pass.
Good job Andy.
I guess so.
Didn't we? I think we did.
Why don't you just have an apple?
Like what?
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
Can someone please help me?
Not occasionally. All the time.
Hey, Rockefeller Center!
How long do you think a week is?
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
You sound pretty defensive Michael.
It's possible.
Come on, we'll all go.
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
That sounds fake.
Hey. Matt, right?
Good God!
Okay.
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Why?
I know.
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
I always come in at 7.
What?
You���ve gotta be kidding me.
No, Kevin -- [sighs]
Not at all.
I don't know how to make that.
Kevin!
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
Actually it is the northernmost.
Meredith!
Meredith, your boob is out.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
[his phone vibrates] He stopped it!
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Him? Him?
Yes, she is. And clinically insane.
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
What's the joke?
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
[whispering] Please. It���s Robert who���s enjoying it.
Since Christmas.
Sure.
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
Yeah.
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
So she's really going to be fine?
[clears throat]
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
Yes?
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
Ok
Oh...
I thought you were already engaged.
Me too.
Hmph.
Easy.
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
But I banked six weeks.
Narddog. [throws Andy a can]
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
I know!
Thank you.
Whoa! Whoa! Dwight! [group reacts]
Dwight has a sister?
All right.
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
Yes.
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Why aren't you in New York?
I couldn't understand a word he said.
So happy. Yeah.
I totally see that. [looking at spreadsheet]
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
Why did Binghamton close?
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Creed?
Done!
Ow! You hit people with that thing?
State Senator.
Jim, you let Michael fall in.
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
We'll see.
Which on in particular?
Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to..
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
Wha-
Really?
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
No, no. Not even.
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
What is it?
Uh, nice party Michael.
He's not even good at his first one.
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
Why would we take the dog?
What does that mean?
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
C���est la vie.
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
That's as simple as I can make it.
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
Why?
You did what?
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
Absolutely.
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
What?
Why don't you just ask him--
[Dwight enters dressed as Recyclops] Not again.
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
Yes.
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
Don't you want to see the baby?
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
[laughs] Yes. [air high five]
So how was your date?
So you have an extra dollar.
That's offensive.
How can we not watch this?
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
[stares at Andy incredulously]
Ok...
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
You're kidding. What was your DJ name?
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Aw.
At least he is in the building.
No kidding.
It was insane!
I want to know.
How was Friday night?
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
$50,000?
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
You're clearly snooping.
Do you not own a mirror?
Yes!
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
My parents were Mexican.
Okay, Toby, I gotta go.
Yeah, I feel terrible about it.
Brava!
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
Why don't we make corn burgers?
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
Can you do this, Kevin?
Hey.
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
That's print.
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
Nice to meet you. [shakes Marie's hand]
[chuckles]
Phyllis, Phyllis.
[phone vibrates, rings]
Okay.
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
Well?
Angela, you look amazing.
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
You know what? I will take Comstock.
Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
I don't even wanna know these things!
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
I think you don't know what you're saying.
Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know.
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
Wow.
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
Huh?
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
Creed.
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
We got it! Wow! We got it!
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
Oh, yeah. Here's the rest of them.
Angela, someone wants you.
Plus everyone would know who you meant.
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
This is why I'm here?
I hope that's it, Kevin.
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
Come stay with me.
Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
Kevin, no.
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
Yes.
He said he wanted me there for support.
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
U..s..a. U-
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
No.
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
Hey, no.
Why would someone hug you?
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Yes!
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
More like fall cleaning. [chuckles]
Totally, that's great.
For me.
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Settle down gentlemen.
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
I'm done!
Let me call you back.
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
Really?
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
Angela, you're more chipper than usual.
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
Hey, look who���s back, Dwight Junior.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
How?  He can't hit back.
Ok, I���ve got my���
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
Pam.
Oh you?
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
my dog Gerald is my life.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
Why are you telling us this?
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
Can I say...?
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
Five years?
You haven't had sex?
[raises wine bottle] To the kitchen!
[whispers to Kevin] Subtle.
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
Yeah.
No!
You said that yesterday.
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
There's no theater in that.
That's what he says?'
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
What is first base with Angela?
What is that?
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
Wow.
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
I don't think so.
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
I think you know.
Oh, who needs a house that size?
What?
Michael left.
Is Matt around? I got his check.
Okay, that's enough, uh.  Thanks, Andy.
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
Yeah, he's in a ladle.
I think I'll just take my chances.
[clears throat more loudly]
He messed yours up to.
How does it end?
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
It's really not.
Angela, I���ll go with you.
Come on Michael. You can...
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
It's going to be okay.
You���ve heard about it?
Sure. [puts in the twenty]
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
You okay? You okay, Stanley?
Those are the bullet points.
I'm in big trouble.
The one of all women?
Hello?
Michael?
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith.
That's her private property.
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
These aren't announcements.
Who's is it? Who wrote that?
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
I think that's it!
[in phone] No, no. Finish the...
[opens door] Michael.
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
OK.
I'll make it. What are you drinking.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
You heard me correctly.
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
It was fine.
Actually I���m the electoral college.
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
What the hell, Dwight?
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
Great.
TV.
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Hey, Jim.
Okay.
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
She's stuck on that one thing.
What?
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
Here, use my pen.
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
[yelling at Michael in Spanish]
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
Angela! [whispering] Angela. There.
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
You're too heavy!
[sigh] What happened, Pam?
Order reference number 00983-126.
What if it were salads?
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
[to Kevin] Separate cars.
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
It's fair.
Eh.
Kevin?
No.
What the hell is going on here?
Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
Are you? [leaves]
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
I'm asking about Certificates of Deposit.
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
You suppose?
���Loyalty pledge���?
You pushed Darryl out the window?
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
She's beautiful.
No, I���m a dog person.
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
What the hell?!
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
Mexican isn't offensive.
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
I'm reporting you.
What's number one?
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
That���s enough!
To be Edwardian.  His best work.
Sure thing Pam, can't wait.
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
What--- What are you winking for?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
Oh, Angela.
Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
Nice to meet you Mark!
Jan is smart.
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
She got pregnant before the wedding.
That's a lot.
Yes. Sorry about that.
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Manual.
Exactly!
What's your money situation?
What are you doing?!
Do you have specifics?
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
But your mouth is ble���
What are we, five?
Michael, are you having money problems?
Oh. Did - did you see that?
[in video] That's supposed to be confidential.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
Where do you guys think we're going?
Kevin!
That's tasteless, Gabe.
What are you implying?
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
Toby, how do you propose that we-
Pleased to meet you.
Irony is such a critical...
[sighs] Oh my God.
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Yes.
You invited someone?
Michael, This is insane.
Senator Lipton, nice to see you.
Dunder Mifflin paper.
My mother's in a wheelchair.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
Stay alive!  I'm getting help!
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Okay.
Yes!
What?!
Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
I am livid, Absolutely livid.
Jan, he went running that way.
You--- you call--- you called her.
Oh.
I was stupid, I told him.
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
Ummm...
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
You're not gonna answer the phone?
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
All right. I can do that. Then what?
Totally, they're the best.
We have missiles too.
Good night, Kevin.
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
Hi, buddy.
I got it.
Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
[whispers] Case Logic.
The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
Why would I love jail?
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Towards me.
Good night Andy.
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
Okay. [walks away]
In this case yes.
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
What bathhouse?
That's a tough one.
I'm on a call.
Martinez.
I'll take the tea pot.
Are you kidding me?
Again? We do that every year.
Where'd you get that kind of money?
Signed what?
[sits at his desk] Hi, Angela.
You are busy! We're in a meeting!
See you there.
What's going on, Michael?
We don���t get it.
How mean are we talking about?
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
Well, I am sorry Kevin.
You like music at least?
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
How would anyone even know--
Hey, nice office.
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
I'll take the ... teapot.
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
It's never gonna happen.
OK.
The numbers are correct, Michael.
Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
Ok.
[confused, whispers] What?
Separate bathrooms.
This is interesting.
Are you attracted to other men?
Bulk or definition?
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
Time's almost up. How many are left?
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
What?
I am dying to know what's in there.
He did it himself.
Just go down, Kevin.
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
He'll call.
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Angela.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
That was you, Kevin.
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
[whispers] Andy brought one too.
State senator.
Hey, Hey Robert!
Oh.
That's a big ethical area?
Well...
He���s making a phone call.
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
Well?
Very much so.
What?
What?
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
How could anyone stand that woman?
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
There you go.
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
And get you the hell outta that place.
Yeah!
I think we can do it.
It's not misleading.
I'm not done yet.
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Who is that?
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
Your office is full of genitalia.
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
