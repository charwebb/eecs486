Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
That's as simple as I can make it.
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
Why would you throw something wet at me?
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
And that's how the printing press was invented.
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
Who are you dating in the public arena?
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
And get you the hell outta that place.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
You know I don't like to participate in the...
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
I think you don't know what you're saying.
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
He literally won't come out of his office.
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
He's not even good at his first one.
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Do you know how to do an intervention?
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
I can help out, if you need me.
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
He said he wanted me there for support.
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
What time do we have to come in?
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
I think the problem with this office is that
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
No one else in this office is gay.
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
All right. I can do that. Then what?
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
This is a lot of credit card debt.
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
You're not sure that you have the job.
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
