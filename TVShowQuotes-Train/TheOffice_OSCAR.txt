Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
It's just...
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
Are you going to tell Michael?
I'd love to talk more about it.
I think we can do it.
I'll take the ... teapot.
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
Good God!
Kevin!
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
How long do you take to pee?
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
She has to know.
You���ve gotta be kidding me.
Now? It's our Christmas party.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
OK.
Pass.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
You wanted to see me?
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
It's a scoreboard.
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
What are you doing?
No. [shakes head back and forth]
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
Irony is such a critical...
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
Here, use my pen.
I'll get him water.
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
okay
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
So how was your date?
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
How?
They finally let you do it!
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
Yes. Sorry about that.
There he is.
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
Good night, Kevin.
Narddog. [throws Andy a can]
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
Stay alive!  I'm getting help!
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
You're not sure that you have the job.
[laughs] Yes. [air high five]
There is no story.
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
Brava!
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
Hey, Michael.
Oh my. That is small.
You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
Angela, you're more chipper than usual.
You know the octagon sign means stop.
Oh, come on.
No!
You sound pretty defensive Michael.
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
Come on, we'll all go.
She's the one.
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
[rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat.
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
Okay, this is much worse than before.
I know!
Go ahead.
Yes!
Yeah.
That's great.
Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Why don't we make corn burgers?
Right.
No.
Like what?
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
You have a brother?
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
Sure.
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
Stanley.
What does that mean?
Oh, Angela.
How does that even compare?
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
You like music at least?
Hey, everyone.
Plus everyone would know who you meant.
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
Last year, he walked 18 miles.
Okay.
Hey. Matt, right?
Well...
Or moon.
[whispers] Case Logic.
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
We do a lot more than that.
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
Pam... I think Robert is gay.
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
[Dwight enters dressed as Recyclops] Not again.
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Yes!
What?!
Why?
Pam, what can be done?
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
[to Kevin] Separate cars.
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
At least.
I don't think so.
Use it in a sentence.
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
Oh, my goodness.
Where do you guys think we're going?
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
Ok.
Okay. I'm done with this.
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
Phyllis, Phyllis.
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
What's going on?
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
I think that's it!
Why would you throw something wet at me?
What?
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
How many bottles? Three hundred?
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
I was in the middle of something.
Michael, are you having money problems?
Angela, you look amazing.
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
We are together. Romantically.
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
Congratulations.  That's great.
Pair of shoes!
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
No, they just made out.  That's it.
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
What?
All right.
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
Why are we doing this?
Meaning what?
All right. I can do that. Then what?
Michael, why?
Jan is smart.
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
$50,000?
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
Is Matt around? I got his check.
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
Like what?
[clicks tongue] Aw...
More or less.
[sees wine collection] Holy cow!
Jan, he went running that way.
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
Okay Pam.
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Wow.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
Skin cancer is treatable.
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
What is this?
What's your money situation?
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
Flip it back please.
I have no idea.
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
How does it end?
Andy bought lunch.
Well?
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
It's like a pay decrease.
Why did Binghamton close?
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
Stop hitting me!
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
Are you kidding me?
I know.
Ah! My hand!  That's hot!
[confused, whispers] What?
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Hmph.
Oh...
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
I'll check us in.
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
What?
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
Jim what are you doing?
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
Whoo, whoo, whoo.
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
Angela!
[raises wine bottle] To the kitchen!
I think you don't know what you're saying.
I got it.
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
These wings are all fat and bone.
It's really not.
It's not fair, you guys.
Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
Como estas, senor?
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
Why would I love jail?
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
I can't believe this is really happening.
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
Jim, you let Michael fall in.
you are incorrigible!
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
Why would we take the dog?
Hey, Jim.
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
There's no theater in that.
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
Hey.
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
Argh!
Pleased to meet you.
I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
Elliot!
Good night Andy.
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
So she's really going to be fine?
Un-be-liev-a-ble.
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
How old is she?
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
Great.
���Loyalty pledge���?
Hey, Dwight.
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
Okay. [walks away]
Not occasionally. All the time.
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
TV.
There's no proof of that.
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
Yeah.
[chuckles]
Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
Everybody shut up and work!
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
No, I have not.
[laughs] Mm.  Yeah.
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
I cannot believe how condescending Andy's being.
Okay, good, okay.  What bank?
Angela, you just were���
Sure.
Who is this guy again?
Oh, you think it's a choice?
Kevin, c'mon.
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
Yes.
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
What happened to Phyllis?
Shh!
I forgive you for kissing me!
Mexican isn't offensive.
You have an address yet in Colorado?
It's possible.
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
To be Edwardian.  His best work.
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
What about February 2nd?
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
What?
Michael.
Is that a volunteer program or���
Dunder Mifflin.
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
We can stay a little longer.
Yes!
You're a saint, Pam.
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
So you have an extra dollar.
What?
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
[whispers] So!?
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
Sure. Hoops!
Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
Martinez.
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
I think there���s, like, $7 left.
Exactly, Andy.
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
No, guys.
Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
We don���t get it.
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
No, I���m a dog person.
[yelling at Michael in Spanish]
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Oh, yeah. Here's the rest of them.
Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
Terrific.
Okay.
Stanley, could you look up 'accomplices'?
I brought you a cookie.
That's great, man.
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
I don't think so.
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.
Well...
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you, Michael.
Why don't you just ask him--
Hey, no.
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
Great.
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
What town do Holly's parents live in?
This is a lot of credit card debt.
Michael, this is a presentation tool.
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
That's her private property.
It was an amateur production, technically.
The note.  So 'holier than thou'.
Okay, that's enough, uh.  Thanks, Andy.
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
Pam's first celebrity crush.
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
Since Christmas.
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
That's the original.
Bankruptcy?
Who?
She's stuck on that one thing.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
I think the problem with this office is that
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Dunder Mifflin paper.
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
She got pregnant before the wedding.
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
It's never gonna happen.
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
What are you implying?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
Erin-
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
Kevin!
You invited someone?
Hold on, hold on, what's going on?
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
Where'd you get that kind of money?
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Yeah.
Yes!
Yeah sure.
Michael I need to talk to you.
Funny Jim. That is funny.
Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
Toby, how do you propose that we-
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
I don't know how to make that.
Where did you get this?
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
He put me here.
WASSUUUUP! [laughing]
I have the chills.
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
Ok. I got one.
[whispers] Andy brought one too.
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Ah, I'll just... wait for him.
It's just not prudent Michael.
Michael left.
Mmm.
Fine.
No! Come on!
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
No one else in this office is gay.
Ummm...
Tasteless.
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
That was you, Kevin.
Thank you.
No!
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
[sits at his desk] Hi, Angela.
Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
I totally see that. [looking at spreadsheet]
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Sweet!
He did it himself.
What's number one?
Don't you want to see the baby?
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Again? We do that every year.
State Senator.
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
You pushed Darryl out the window?
Good.
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
Those guys always change back, Angela.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
See you there.
No horseplay.
Totally, that's great.
So Michael, what do you think?
Per mile.
In this case yes.
We were never lovers!
Pam.
Aah!
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
I'm good.
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
A real David and Goliath story.
Yes, yes, absolutely.
But I banked six weeks.
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
Thank... Yeah...
I would rather not.
Yeah?
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
Why would someone hug you?
Signed what?
Okay.
Is that true, Toby?
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
Listen to this.
I'm in.
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
And get you the hell outta that place.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty.
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
Whoa! Whoa! Dwight! [group reacts]
Thank you.
Erin, what are you doing?
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
My mother's in a wheelchair.
���Three PM Girl���
We have missiles too.
Come stay with me.
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
Settle down gentlemen.
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
[opens door] Michael.
Bulk or definition?
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
I'm in.
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Oh... hey.
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
I'm on the phone.
Michael? Poor Richard's?
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
Dwight has a sister?
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
We'll miss you.
How can you live with yourself?
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
C���est la vie.
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
Creed.
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
You're gonna get us a copier then?
He knew!
Why?
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
Can I say...?
Angela, I���ll go with you.
Pam, really? Come on.
What the hell?!
Here.
Ok, that's a joke.
It's not pizza.
Probably went to his head.
I'll take the tea pot.
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
That's impossible.
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
State senator.
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
I think it should be Darryl.
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
What bathhouse?
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
Hey.
What?!
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
He's not even good at his first one.
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
It wasn't me.
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
[whispering] Please. It���s Robert who���s enjoying it.
Well...
Absolutely.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
Totally, they're the best.
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
Can't you just tell us.
Those figures I gave you? They're false.
Would you, please? Please.
Merry Christmas to you.
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
Very much so.
Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
Forty-two.
[sigh] What happened, Pam?
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
Good morning. [clears throat]
Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith.
Do you know how to do an intervention?
Oh. Did - did you see that?
They're our largest client.
[laughs]
Andy, something is wrong with that woman.
If you don't mind me asking---
I should step into sales myself.
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
Why won't you do Andy?
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
Have you been to the beach yet?
Let it ride. Let it all ride.
Hey Michael.
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
Thank you David.
Michael, if I gave you...
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
I am livid, Absolutely livid.
[in video] That's supposed to be confidential.
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
Well, it's-
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
Good luck!
Easy.
Nice to meet you Mark!
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
Yes.
Michael --
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
Kevin.
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
Actually I���m the electoral college.
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
Thank you.
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
Hey, nice office.
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Nice to meet you. [shakes Marie's hand]
What? What?
Well?
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
You owe me and apology.
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
Wow.
Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying.
[with horns honking] Kevin, can-
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
[everyone talking to the camera] Just--
You suppose?
Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin]
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
What time do we have to come in?
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
Order reference number 00983-126.
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
Time's almost up. How many are left?
You're waterboarding me!
El telefono.
Alright.
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
Ok...
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
These questions are bush league.
Yes.
How 'bout, she takes it down?
Because I don't want my benefits slashed.
Because we're looking up jail time.
That's gotta be tough.
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
I was stupid, I told him.
That's... that's... that's very generous.
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
Oh, he's plenty strong.
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
That's print.
Because I'm gay?
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
Angela, you still have your son.
Meredith, I-
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
Aw.
You���re not gay.
I'm just curious.
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
What--- What are you winking for?
There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
He���s making a phone call.
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
This constitutes identity fraud.
This is nuts.
That's no accident.
Chicken marsala.
What?
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
Here you go, Creed.
Oh, who needs a house that size?
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
Hey.
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
Come on Toby.
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Really?
No.
Okay, Toby, I gotta go.
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
I can help out, if you need me.
That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim]
Is that Chet Montgomery?
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
Do you have specifics?
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
Kevin?
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
Is there a front runner?
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
Yeah.
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
I couldn't understand a word he said.
More like fall cleaning. [chuckles]
She's beautiful.
[his phone vibrates] He stopped it!
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
Hey, Hey Robert!
Oh, I���m sure ...that���s nothing.
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
...I'll do it.
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
I want to know.
I knew that, I knew it.
Really?
Knock, knock. Oh!
Oh you?
What is this?
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
You know I don't like to participate in the...
That���s enough Kevin.
Meredith, your boob is out.
When is the funeral?
Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?
Maybe over some coffee later?
I hope that's it, Kevin.
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
He'll call.
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
It could be snacks, or-
You have CDs?
Yes, yes, yes!
What?
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
I think you know.
Not at all.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Uh, nice party Michael.
No, no. Not even.
It's going to be okay.
I don't think he meant, that--
Michael, This is insane.
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
[clears throat more loudly]
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
Do you not own a mirror?
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
I'm messing with you, Holly.
Who are you dating in the public arena?
How would anyone even know--
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Perfect.
This is not good.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
You're forty-three.  Mick Jagger's like sixty-five.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
Turkey is a healthy meat.
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
Eh.
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
And that's how the printing press was invented.
That's really not our job.
What's your point.
What is this about?
What?
Hi.
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
Creed?
Wow.
Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
I, uh, huh, just [chuckles nervously]
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
Hello?
What? No!
She's always late, she's always rude...
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
...Andy.
Yeah.  [Oscar gets up and walks out]
What is that?
How do you even know they're gay?
Pam, I'm sorry--
He's on one of his honeymoons.
Yes, she is. And clinically insane.
Are you guys listening to this?
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
Bye.
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
Michael. Reading.
Five years?
Angela! [whispering] Angela. There.
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
You are busy! We're in a meeting!
You said that yesterday.
[stares at Andy incredulously]
That's a big ethical area?
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
Dwight!
He said he wanted me there for support.
Wow.  Now we can afford hard-cover books.
Ow! Robert?!
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
You heard me correctly.
I���m so sorry. Angela--
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
Great, they stole my laptop.
Why?
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
Michael, can I talk to you?
Actually it is the northernmost.
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
Yes, I'm gay.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
Good job Andy.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Meredith!
Yes, they can.
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
These aren't announcements.
What if it were salads?
Put the 'q' there, sweetie.
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
Who's is it? Who wrote that?
All right.
But you just!
What's going on, Michael?
How old is she?
That's a tough one.
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
We knew. Ryan told us.
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
Oh. [fixes his dress]
[on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know.
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
Why do you say that?
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
Alright. Alright I get it.
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
It's, it's a completely different name!
Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
Will you marry me?
What is it?
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
OK.
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
Role call.
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
[phone vibrates, rings]
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
That's as simple as I can make it.
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
I always come in at 7.
No.
[laughs] That's disgusting.
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
I promised I wouldn't tell.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
That's offensive.
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
But your mouth is ble���
I just told them to do it!
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
So ten
Yes!
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Wha-
YOLO! [singing and dancing]
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
Huh?
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
You did it, Kevin.
What?
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
I'm done!
I have a question.
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
For me.
You're not gonna answer the phone?
I had a good time too.
No, I just like tea.
No.
I saw it.
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
Again, that gives us no information.
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
I know.
That's too funny.
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
Wow.
Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
Ah...
Yes.
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
I have a very strong suspicion.
Done!
Ok...
U..s..a. U-
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
Me too.
It was crazy.
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
Oh!
Come on buddy, get back.
Yes.
The Atlantic.
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
Actually, it's just-
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
Michael?
How could anyone stand that woman?
[laughing]
Hey, Rockefeller Center!
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
Someone please explain it to Kevin.
Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Exactly!
That's what he says?'
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
Wow.
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
What have you been doing?
That���s���that���s awful, Angela. I���m so sorry.
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
Yeah, it was.
What did you end up with?
I jus... I just need a signature.
What are you implying?
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
Where was that.
He���s fine.
I never suggested...
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
Andy. [alert sounds]
Who is that?
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
Go to the recorded version.
Ok!
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
What's the joke?
Sure thing Pam, can't wait.
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
Him? Him?
What was that?
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?
You got a bonus check?
Senator Lipton, nice to see you.
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
Let me call you back.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs]
I'm reporting you.
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
It's gonna hurt.
I don't know.
I am dying to know what's in there.
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
Separate bathrooms.
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
Hey, we're going with the chairs.
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
Yeah.
Sure. [puts in the twenty]
Angela, it���s a lead freaking pipe.
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
Ok, I���ve got my���
Why aren't you in New York?
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
What's up, Pam?
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
Oh.
Just- no.  No.
Andy, no-
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
I'm not done yet.
Mmm...
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
������C-SPAN���?
Try another sentence.
Hey, look who���s back, Dwight Junior.
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
Manual.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
Michael, Michael I... [blinds rustle] ... inside.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
To both these bears.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
Just go down, Kevin.
All right, Meredith.
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
Okay.
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?
What's the next one?
They caught us kissing on Halloween.
[nodding] I did. Yes.
I don't even wanna know these things!
Yes! The freaking PDA!
It's not misleading.
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
What are you doing?
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
You okay? You okay, Stanley?
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
[whispers to Kevin] Subtle.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
Can you breathe okay?
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
You--- you call--- you called her.
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
You know what? I will take Comstock.
Well, I am sorry Kevin.
What the hell, Dwight?
Yes?
That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
Okay.
That's not.
It starts on it's own. Let it -
What's that supposed to mean?
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
That���s enough!
Huh?
OK, the health care plan.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
There you go.
Angela, someone wants you.
Right there.
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
It was fine.
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
How?  He can't hit back.
Yeah, brosef.
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
Yeah.
What?
I guess so.
What?
Yeah.
I'm on a call.
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
[Kelly faints] Oh!
They can.
Good luck.
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
100 dollars.
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
My parents were Mexican.
Yeah, now it doesn't make any sense.
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
That reeks, and I'm trying to eat.
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Wow, it's so... healthy.
Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to..
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
Yeah!
You���re back?
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
[clears throat]
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
Those are the bullet points.
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
Are you attracted to other men?
Definitely no.
So...
That's funny.
Can someone please help me?
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
You did what?
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
No.
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
Can you do this, Kevin?
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
You're too heavy!
Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
The numbers are correct, Michael.
Hello.
What the hell is going on here?
Didn't we? I think we did.
We'll see.
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
Well, I bet it was a smash.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
Yes, he's innocent.
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
No, it's fine.
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
Thank God.
That sounds fake.
[buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
They're a descriptive people.
They
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Yep, here they are.
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Guys! Over here, we found the bus.
Nuh uh.
So happy hour.
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
How was Friday night?
I thought you were already engaged.
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
It's not that kind of ladle.
So happy. Yeah.
I'm gay!
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
Okay.
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
You���ve heard about it?
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
That's tasteless, Gabe.
You haven't had sex?
How long do you think a week is?
Angela.
He messed yours up to.
It's her first try.
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
You put a note in my food?
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
[chuckling] Isn't it a seven-hour drive?
Are you? [leaves]
Hoop it up, right.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
Michael...
