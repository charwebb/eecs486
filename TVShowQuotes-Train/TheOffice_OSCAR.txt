It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
That's as simple as I can make it.
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
It starts on it's own. Let it -
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
This is a lot of credit card debt.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
You know I don't like to participate in the...
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
I can help out, if you need me.
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
How long do you think a week is?
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
And that's how the printing press was invented.
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
You're not sure that you have the job.
Why would you throw something wet at me?
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
Who are you dating in the public arena?
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
He's not even good at his first one.
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
All right. I can do that. Then what?
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
I think the problem with this office is that
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
I am dying to know what's in there.
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
Do you know how to do an intervention?
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
And get you the hell outta that place.
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
No one else in this office is gay.
He said he wanted me there for support.
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
