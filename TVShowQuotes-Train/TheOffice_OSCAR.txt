My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
I am dying to know what's in there.
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
I think you don't know what you're saying.
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
Do you know how to do an intervention?
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
You're not sure that you have the job.
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
I can help out, if you need me.
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
You know I don't like to participate in the...
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
What time do we have to come in?
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
He said he wanted me there for support.
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
No one else in this office is gay.
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
All right. I can do that. Then what?
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
Who are you dating in the public arena?
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
How long do you think a week is?
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
He's not even good at his first one.
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
That's as simple as I can make it.
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
Why would you throw something wet at me?
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
And get you the hell outta that place.
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
This is a lot of credit card debt.
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
I think the problem with this office is that
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
He literally won't come out of his office.
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
And that's how the printing press was invented.
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
You could all be doing this, just saying.
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
