What is that?
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
No.
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
We were never lovers!
What's number one?
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
Probably went to his head.
Hey.
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
Ok, I���ve got my���
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
[phone vibrates, rings]
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
More like fall cleaning. [chuckles]
What is it?
Yeah.
Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
Well, I bet it was a smash.
Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.
What the hell, Dwight?
Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Yes!
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Are you guys listening to this?
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
Perfect.
My mom. [puts card in pocket]
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
I'll take the ... teapot.
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
It's going to be okay.
Yes.
State Senator.
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
Who?
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
The numbers are correct, Michael.
He'll call.
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
Oh, he's plenty strong.
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
Michael I need to talk to you.
[raises wine bottle] To the kitchen!
Pass.
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Whoo, whoo, whoo.
I'll check us in.
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
Well?
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
[whispers] So!?
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
Sure thing Pam, can't wait.
We'll see.
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
I'm asking about Certificates of Deposit.
Wow.
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
YOLO! [singing and dancing]
[chuckles]
Meredith, your boob is out.
[his phone vibrates] He stopped it!
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
Where did you get this?
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Dumpster Man.
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Go ahead.
You're too heavy!
Thank you.
That's tasteless, Gabe.
That's not.
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
Yes.
Go to the recorded version.
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
What are we, five?
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
Oh...
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
Congratulations.  That's great.
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
Here.
That's great, man.
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
It's, it's a completely different name!
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
A real David and Goliath story.
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
[Kelly faints] Oh!
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
[stares at Andy incredulously]
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
I think that's it!
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
You're clearly snooping.
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
Why don't you just ask him--
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
How?  He can't hit back.
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
What is this?
You could all be doing this, just saying.
Not at all.
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Hey, we're going with the chairs.
Everybody shut up and work!
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
I had a good time too.
These wings are all fat and bone.
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
Angela, you still have your son.
Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
[to Kevin] Separate cars.
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
Separate bathrooms.
What's your money situation?
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
Why don't we make corn burgers?
I can't.
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
Ok
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
Michael, can I talk to you?
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
[yelling at Michael in Spanish]
I'll get him water.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
Do you know?
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
Hey.
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
Well...
This is interesting.
Well...
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
Where'd you get that kind of money?
I couldn't understand a word he said.
That's the original.
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
������C-SPAN���?
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
Thank you.
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
Which on in particular?
Yes?
Who are you dating in the public arena?
Ok...
Kevin?
Um..
You heard me correctly.
What are you implying?
Didn't we? I think we did.
Forty-two.
Towards me.
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
Jan.
How can you live with yourself?
At least.
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
Thank you.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
No one else in this office is gay.
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
okay
No, they just made out.  That's it.
What are you guys talkin' about?
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
What time do we have to come in?
So Michael, what do you think?
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
Really?
Oh.
he's a historian.
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
Well, it's-
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
[rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat.
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
He���s making a phone call.
Can you breathe okay?
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
There's no theater in that.
Easy.
Yeah.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
Michael --
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
In this case yes.
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
Why are you telling us this?
You have an address yet in Colorado?
All right, Meredith.
Turkey is a healthy meat.
Oh. Did - did you see that?
I don't know.
Yes!
[laughs] That's disgusting.
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
Oh you?
That's a big ethical area?
Michael...
Last year, he walked 18 miles.
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
Why did Binghamton close?
He knew!
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
Can you do this, Kevin?
I'm just curious.
I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
It's not pizza.
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
No!
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
I'm on a call.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
You are busy! We're in a meeting!
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
Ow! Robert?!
Yes! The freaking PDA!
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
Don't.
How long do you think a week is?
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
I have a question.
Flip it back please.
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
���Three PM Girl���
Ten percent?
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Stanley, could you look up 'accomplices'?
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
Put the 'q' there, sweetie.
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
No, thank you, Angela.
Skin cancer is treatable.
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
Can't you just tell us.
Andy. That is her private property.
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
Why would we take the dog?
What? No!
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
The note.  So 'holier than thou'.
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
Wow.
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
[everyone talking to the camera] Just--
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
Him? Him?
Angela, you look amazing.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
Why won't you do Andy?
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
She's the one.
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
Settle down gentlemen.
I'm in big trouble.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
What the hell is going on here?
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
���Loyalty pledge���?
What are you doing?
What's going on, Michael?
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
Let it ride. Let it all ride.
Senator Lipton, nice to see you.
Kevin!
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
Wha-
Oh!
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
No! Come on!
Mm-hmm.
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
Terrific.
Yes.
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
Or moon.
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
What is first base with Angela?
It's never gonna happen.
So how was your date?
Okay, this is much worse than before.
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
Pam, what can be done?
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
A triple word.
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
Guys! Over here, we found the bus.
OK.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
How does it end?
Eh.
I can help out, if you need me.
Hey, nice office.
You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
Dunder Mifflin paper.
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
These questions are bush league.
Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.
Okay.
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
Angela, you're more chipper than usual.
Come on Toby.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
All right.
C���est la vie.
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
Hey.
He messed yours up to.
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Why?
Pleased to meet you.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
[chuckling] Isn't it a seven-hour drive?
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
Is there a front runner?
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
You put a note in my food?
You have CDs?
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
What's the next one?
So you have an extra dollar.
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
What have you been doing?
I know.
Definitely no.
That's her private property.
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
Andy bought lunch.
So happy hour.
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
Hold on, hold on, what's going on?
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
I don't think so.
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
[laughs] Yes. [air high five]
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
Elliot!
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
I'm gay!
Again, that gives us no information.
Andy, no-
I saw it.
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
Chicken marsala.
Hi.
It's like a pay decrease.
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
Yeah, now it doesn't make any sense.
They finally let you do it!
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
I was stupid, I told him.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
Can I say...?
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
Ah...
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
Would you, please? Please.
[in video] That's supposed to be confidential.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?
Oh.
Great.
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
He did it himself.
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
Your office is full of genitalia.
Oh, you think it's a choice?
I think I'll just take my chances.
You're waterboarding me!
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
He put me here.
Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
How can we not watch this?
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
Phyllis, Phyllis.
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
That���s enough!
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
It's just not prudent Michael.
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
That's what he says?'
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
What?
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
All right. I can do that. Then what?
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
Ummm...
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
Ah, I'll just... wait for him.
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
I think you know.
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
No kidding.
For me.
Mexican isn't offensive.
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
Oh. [fixes his dress]
Jan is smart.
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
There's no proof of that.
You're not sure that you have the job.
Can someone please help me?
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.
So happy. Yeah.
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
This is a lot of credit card debt.
But you just!
My parents were Mexican.
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
Narddog. [throws Andy a can]
Yes.
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
You said that yesterday.
So what do you think?
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
Great, they stole my laptop.
Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
You okay? You okay, Stanley?
I'm reporting you.
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
Hey.
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
Yeah, he's in a ladle.
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
You owe me and apology.
It was insane!
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
Yeah.
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
[whispers] Case Logic.
Ok. I got one.
Those are the bullet points.
Because we're looking up jail time.
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
Again? We do that every year.
Pam, I'm sorry--
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
Yeah, I feel terrible about it.
Kevin!
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
[confused, whispers] What?
Hey, Hey Robert!
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Bankruptcy?
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
So...
Oh, who needs a house that size?
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
Yes.
Funny Jim. That is funny.
Martinez.
Dwight has a sister?
I think there���s, like, $7 left.
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
Yes. Sorry about that.
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
[whispering] Please. It���s Robert who���s enjoying it.
Hey, look who���s back, Dwight Junior.
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
Is everything okay?
Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!
Meredith, don't.
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Really?
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
Oh, I���m sure ...that���s nothing.
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
What?
Because I don't want my benefits slashed.
He's not even good at his first one.
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
Mmm...
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
That's gotta be tough.
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
Andy.
What?!
Okay, that's enough, uh.  Thanks, Andy.
Pam... I think Robert is gay.
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
Okay.
How old is she?
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
That's as simple as I can make it.
Home is where the
It wasn't me.
Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs]
Michael, This is insane.
Sure. Hoops!
What?
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
Are you going to tell Michael?
Just leave it how you said...
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
What's that supposed to mean?
Where do you guys think we're going?
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
No.
You got a bonus check?
Per mile.
Okay.
That's really not our job.
He���s fine.
...I'll do it.
Good God!
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
I totally see that. [looking at spreadsheet]
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
No, I���m a dog person.
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
Yes, it is.
See you there.
Exactly, Andy.
[with horns honking] Kevin, can-
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
Yes, I'm gay.
They're our largest client.
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
That's great.
Hmph.
I promised I wouldn't tell.
Five years?
You invited someone?
Aw.
No. [shakes head back and forth]
No horseplay.
Is that Chet Montgomery?
It starts on it's own. Let it -
But I banked six weeks.
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
Huh?
Yes, yes, absolutely.
What are you doing?
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
I knew that, I knew it.
Why do you say that?
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
Huh?
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
Yeah sure.
Sure.
He's on one of his honeymoons.
Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty.
Hey, Rockefeller Center!
When is the funeral?
Okay. I'm done with this.
Wow.  Now we can afford hard-cover books.
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
I always come in at 7.
Michael, why?
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?
That���s enough Kevin.
What's the joke?
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
I just told them to do it!
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
I'm not done yet.
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
[sigh] What happened, Pam?
I'm in.
Why would someone hug you?
Do you know how to do an intervention?
Shh!
I hope that's it, Kevin.
Don't you want to see the baby?
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Good.
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
Someone please explain it to Kevin.
Erin-
U..s..a. U-
You call him!
Oh, my goodness.
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
I think you don't know what you're saying.
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
What--- What are you winking for?
Come stay with me.
$50,000?
Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith.
Just take her name off of everything.
Andy. [alert sounds]
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
Why would you throw something wet at me?
Hey, no.
Why'd you say dollars?
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
Yes, yes, yes!
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
Ok.
No, it's fine.
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
The one of all women?
Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying.
my dog Gerald is my life.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
Yes!
Good morning. [clears throat]
Yeah.
Michael.
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
Maybe you're right, who are we to...
Just- no.  No.
It's a scoreboard.
Whoa! Whoa! Dwight! [group reacts]
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
What's your point.
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
You're gonna get us a copier then?
Hello?
Okay.
It's her first try.
Michael?
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Oh my God, what happened?
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
Ow! You hit people with that thing?
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
That's no accident.
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
More or less.
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
I, uh, huh, just [chuckles nervously]
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
We have missiles too.
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
Kelly's on your side.
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
[buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
What about February 2nd?
We are together. Romantically.
Alright.
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
It was fine.
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
How 'bout, she takes it down?
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
[clicks tongue] Aw...
You did what?
Well, I am sorry Kevin.
Ooh.
Well���
It's not misleading.
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
No, that's a flush.
What is this about?
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
You're forty-three.  Mick Jagger's like sixty-five.
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
There is no story.
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Dwight.
Not occasionally. All the time.
Totally, that's great.
You know I don't like to participate in the...
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
How mean are we talking about?
So ten
What's going on?
What?
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
Michael? Poor Richard's?
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Exactly!
I have no idea.
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
Yeah, brosef.
Why aren't you in New York?
Great.
I think it should be Darryl.
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
Okay Pam.
What?
Can you believe this?
Meaning what?
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
It's really not.
Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
How?
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
Oh... hey.
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
What?
I'll make it. What are you drinking.
You haven't had sex?
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
What? What?
She's always late, she's always rude...
What's up, Pam?
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
100 dollars.
Pam.
Oh my. That is small.
Here, use my pen.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
Yeah, it was.
Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin]
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
Manual.
Well...
Andy, something is wrong with that woman.
It's not fair, you guys.
I cannot believe how condescending Andy's being.
Yeah.
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
Okay, good, okay.  What bank?
Meredith, I-
There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
I'll take the tea pot.
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
Is that true, Toby?
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
Sweet!
Knock, knock. Oh!
I know.
I am dying to know what's in there.
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?
Do you have specifics?
I'm done!
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
Stop hitting me!
[sits at his desk] Hi, Angela.
Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
You pushed Darryl out the window?
Hey, everyone.
You--- you call--- you called her.
Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
Time's almost up. How many are left?
Michael, I don't know what to say.
Like what?
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
Where was that.
I would rather not.
And that's how the printing press was invented.
Good night, Kevin.
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
What did you end up with?
Creed.
Argh!
Tasteless.
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
Why don't you just have an apple?
What?!
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
No, guys.
I know!
What?
That sounds fake.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
No, no. Not even.
Actually it is the northernmost.
[sighs] Oh my God.
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
WASSUUUUP! [laughing]
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
Dwight!
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
Michael, Michael I... [blinds rustle] ... inside.
Oh, come on.
I forgive you for kissing me!
Hey, Jim.
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
What?
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
Wow.
Thank... Yeah...
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
What are you doing?
Wow, it's so... healthy.
Yeah.  [Oscar gets up and walks out]
You���re not gay.
Just go down, Kevin.
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
Thank you, Michael.
You're not gonna answer the phone?
Alright. Alright I get it.
Michael left.
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
Angela, someone wants you.
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
What is this?
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
We don���t get it.
Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know.
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
Actually, it's just-
Yeah.
Yes.
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
[clears throat more loudly]
That���s���that���s awful, Angela. I���m so sorry.
Why are we doing this?
What are you doing?!
I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
Hey Michael.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
[opens door] Michael.
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
I'm on the phone.
There he is.
Michael, this is a presentation tool.
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
They can.
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
Brava!
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Kevin.
Okay, Toby, I gotta go.
Yeah.
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
You wanted to see me?
It's possible.
No, Kevin -- [sighs]
Okay.
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Totally, they're the best.
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
Nice to meet you Mark!
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
Stay alive!  I'm getting help!
Right.
What?
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
OK, the health care plan.
This constitutes identity fraud.
How old is she?
Kevin, c'mon.
We knew. Ryan told us.
What town do Holly's parents live in?
Now? It's our Christmas party.
Hoop it up, right.
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
We do a lot more than that.
It could be snacks, or-
What happened to Phyllis?
I���m so sorry. Angela--
Those guys always change back, Angela.
I don't know how to make that.
That's... that's... that's very generous.
[clears throat]
Ok, that's a joke.
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
I want to know.
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
Erin, what are you doing?
Use it in a sentence.
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
Pam's first celebrity crush.
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
These aren't announcements.
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
You're a saint, Pam.
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
What?
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Ok...
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
To be Edwardian.  His best work.
What are you implying?
Come on, we'll all go.
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
The Atlantic.
Kevin, no.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
Is that a volunteer program or���
I'm good.
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
This is nuts.
Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
...Andy.
Hi.
He said he wanted me there for support.
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
Michael. Reading.
I'd love to talk more about it.
[in phone] No, no. Finish the...
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
Nuh uh.
How was Friday night?
You did it, Kevin.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
Dwight please!
TV.
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
I was in the middle of something.
Try another sentence.
Yeah!
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
It's gonna hurt.
Who's the senator?
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
Jim what are you doing?
Signed what?
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
That's funny.
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
This is why I'm here?
Those figures I gave you? They're false.
Sure. [puts in the twenty]
It's just...
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
No!
Angela, I���ll go with you.
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
Right there.
All right.
Still, that's not anything.
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
How long do you take to pee?
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
What?
Have you been to the beach yet?
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
You���re back?
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
Yes!
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
That reeks, and I'm trying to eat.
Toby, how do you propose that we-
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
Thank you David.
[Dwight enters dressed as Recyclops] Not again.
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
Come on Michael. You can...
There you go.
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
What?
No.
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
So she's really going to be fine?
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
Okay.
We'll miss you.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
That's a tough one.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
No thank you.
Good luck.
That was you, Kevin.
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
[laughing]
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
Merry Christmas to you.
To both these bears.
Fine.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
Oh, that's very funny.
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
Me too.
Aah!
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
Why?
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
Like what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I brought you a cookie.
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
I don't know.
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
I can't believe this is really happening.
That's print.
Maybe over some coffee later?
Why would I love jail?
Angela, it���s a lead freaking pipe.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
Creed?
Hey, Michael.
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
I don't think so.
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
Angela! [whispering] Angela. There.
Well?
Pair of shoes!
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
OK.
Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
She's stuck on that one thing.
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
She's beautiful.
I should step into sales myself.
What bathhouse?
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
Very much so.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
What the hell?!
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
I have a very strong suspicion.
You���ve gotta be kidding me.
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
Thank you.
The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
Michael, if I gave you...
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
They
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
She got pregnant before the wedding.
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
Who's is it? Who wrote that?
We got it! Wow! We got it!
Do you not own a mirror?
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
Oh, yeah. Here's the rest of them.
Angela!
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
Donate to the charity?
It's not that kind of ladle.
I don't think so.
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
It was crazy.
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
You���ve heard about it?
Ok!
Thank God.
Okay.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
What part Native American?
How many bottles? Three hundred?
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
It's not that funny.
Hello.
Yeah, yeah.
I am livid, Absolutely livid.
Michael, are you having money problems?
[laughs]
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
You have a brother?
Why?
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
Where are you getting this information?
What was that?
How do you even know they're gay?
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
Yes, they can.
I'm messing with you, Holly.
Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
It's maddening!
What does that mean?
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
Salman Rushdie.
Yeah.
Yes!
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
It's fair.
[laughs] Mm.  Yeah.
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
I'm in.
How does that even compare?
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
No, I just like tea.
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
They're a descriptive people.
Como estas, senor?
Nice to meet you. [shakes Marie's hand]
I don't think he meant, that--
Absolutely.
You like music at least?
He literally won't come out of his office.
[whispers to Kevin] Subtle.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
Come on buddy, get back.
That's impossible.
Un-be-liev-a-ble.
That's offensive.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
Order reference number 00983-126.
No.
Hi, buddy.
They caught us kissing on Halloween.
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
Listen to this.
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
This is not good.
Good luck!
Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
