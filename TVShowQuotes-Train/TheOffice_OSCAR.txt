Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
All right. I can do that. Then what?
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
I think the problem with this office is that
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
He literally won't come out of his office.
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
He said he wanted me there for support.
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
It starts on it's own. Let it -
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
No one else in this office is gay.
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
Why would you throw something wet at me?
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
I am dying to know what's in there.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
How long do you think a week is?
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
I think you don't know what you're saying.
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
This is a lot of credit card debt.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
That's as simple as I can make it.
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
And get you the hell outta that place.
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
Who are you dating in the public arena?
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
You know I don't like to participate in the...
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
He's not even good at his first one.
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
