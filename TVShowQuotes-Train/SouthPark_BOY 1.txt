Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!

Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. 

Wow! Someone from the past is on the line!  Hello? Is there a refrigierator running? Well then, you'd better go catch it! 

Wow! He can bowl. 

Oh hey, Kenny. Who's this?

Shut up, bitch! 

Wull what do you mean?

What are you talking about? The poor kid at this school is Jacob Hallery. 

He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff.

Sometimes he's firm.

"Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?" 

Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre-  Erp.

They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.

We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him.

They tricked us again, huh?

Agh! I'm so bored.

Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?

If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. 

I just want you to know that I have a hure crush on you and-  HEY! 

I shall put the magic spell on you!

Huh?

Wow, what's this?

Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way.

Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go! 

It went this way?

Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!

Yes, Mommy.

Alright, kid. Time to die. 

Did he do stuff like this at your old school?

Those two should just screw and get it over with!

Do you want some acid?

Loogie.

Rowwr!

Wwaaahahahahaaha 

Where did it go? Do you see where it went?
