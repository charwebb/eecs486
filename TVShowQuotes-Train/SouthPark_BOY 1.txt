Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre-  Erp.
Did he do stuff like this at your old school?
We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him.
Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
"Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?" 
Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. 
I shall put the magic spell on you!
Those two should just screw and get it over with!
Where did it go? Do you see where it went?
Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way.
Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go! 
They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.
Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?
If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. 
Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!
Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!
What are you talking about? The poor kid at this school is Jacob Hallery.
