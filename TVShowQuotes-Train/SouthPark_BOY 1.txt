He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff.

Where did it go? Do you see where it went?

Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!

Rowwr!

Do you want some acid?

Did he do stuff like this at your old school?

Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. 

It went this way?

Wow, what's this?

Oh hey, Kenny. Who's this?

Yes, Mommy.

They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.

We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him.

Those two should just screw and get it over with!

I just want you to know that I have a hure crush on you and-  HEY! 

Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way.

I shall put the magic spell on you!

Alright, kid. Time to die. 

Sometimes he's firm.

What are you talking about? The poor kid at this school is Jacob Hallery. 

Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre-  Erp.

Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go! 

"Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?" 

Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.

They tricked us again, huh?

Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?

Shut up, bitch! 

Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!

Wow! Someone from the past is on the line!  Hello? Is there a refrigierator running? Well then, you'd better go catch it! 

Yes, Mommy.

Agh! I'm so bored.

Loogie.

Wull what do you mean?

Huh?

Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!
