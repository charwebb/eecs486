Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go! 
What are you talking about? The poor kid at this school is Jacob Hallery. 
Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
Those two should just screw and get it over with!
Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way.
Wow! Someone from the past is on the line!  Hello? Is there a refrigierator running? Well then, you'd better go catch it! 
We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him.
Where did it go? Do you see where it went?
"Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?" 
I shall put the magic spell on you!
Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!
Did he do stuff like this at your old school?
Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. 
If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. 
Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?
They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.
Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre-  Erp.
