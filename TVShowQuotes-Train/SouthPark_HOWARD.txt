I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help.
Come on, damn it!  Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays.
Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!
Hey, bring us down some food, all right?
All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while.
That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson!
All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go. 
If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids.
All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something. 
Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?!
Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me.
Come on up, it's okay.  Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy.
Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here.
What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house!
