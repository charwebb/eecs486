Come on, damn it!  Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays.
I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help.
What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house!
If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids.
Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?!
Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!
That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson!
Come on up, it's okay.  Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy.
Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials.
All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go. 
Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me.
Hey, bring us down some food, all right?
Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here.
All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something.
