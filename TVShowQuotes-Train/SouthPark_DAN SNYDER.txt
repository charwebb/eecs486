We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing!
Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!
Uh I guess we can live with that.
Hut! Hut Hut Hut!  Hut hut hut. Hut Hut Hut Hut!  Hut. Hut hut hut. Hut Hut! 
My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins
Don't let them break you! Don't let them win! 
Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization "The Washington Redskins", its offensive to us?
Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name.
No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points.
Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization.
And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this!
Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?
And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart?
Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again!
Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?!
