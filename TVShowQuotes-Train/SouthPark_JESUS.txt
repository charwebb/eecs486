Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback.
Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. 
Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.
The lights are turned way down low, so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30.
The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!
Yes. Yes, I think I do.  We need a little Christmas miracle.  Lock and load! We're goin' in!
Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!
Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.
Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute. 
All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. 
Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.
My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.
I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.  I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment. 
If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle.
Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.
Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.
And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--
My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-
It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
Uhhh... Hi.  Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.  We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver.
Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.
That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa!  Smith! Try your ice breath! 
Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again.
So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?
Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!
Aw, come on! I weigh more than that.
Oh, what are you gonna do? Kwy now?
So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?
Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.
Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?
Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.
My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...
Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones.  Caller, you're on the air.
Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago.
So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.
Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! 
Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!
Yea, children. I am the way and the light...
So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?
A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!  Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? 
Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.
My child,  have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad.
Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto.  Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.
Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.
These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can.
God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.
Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.
You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!
W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions.  Yes, uhh, you over there. 
Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit. 
Away in the manger, no crib for My bed
That's where cute little old Me lay down My sweet head.
The stars in the sky (Santa: Ooooo)
He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.
Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? 
-- Yea, the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and- 
Holy Me, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.
But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!
Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. 
Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.  Yes, your comments.
My children, you should know something.  I'm packing.  Let's go! 
That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.
I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!
Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.
We have to get him out of there.
We'll never get out in time to stop him!
I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud.
Let him come then. I shall stop him!
But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.
Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions….
Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it.
That's right, Santa, and we love each and every one of them. Like this one.
Joy to the world, for I have come.
Let earth receive Me!
Let every heart prepare Me room. 
Nobody is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!
Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?
Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.
I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.
Shut the fuck up!  Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused. 
You're a... bad liar.  Yay. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh?
Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now.  This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right.
That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.
Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. 
Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return. 
We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad!  Great Scott!
Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--
Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.
This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.
Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around.  Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay now, turn back.  It is now wine!
I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here. 
What are you doing out so late, kids?
Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish.
Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.
P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?
It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! 
The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.
My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle!  Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around  Ya need tuh- turn around.  Okay, now turn back. 
Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing?  Can I help you with something? 
We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!
No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?
Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega.  The Beginning and the End.
Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you.
Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.  First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals' 
If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party.
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye to Bethlehem to see-ee Me...
Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod "Do You Think I'm Sexy?" Stewart! 
One man cannot be the voice of the Church!
Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!
Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.
You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help.
Oh. Kids, yeyou believe I can beat Satan, right?
Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.
Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's-
No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.
But as long as you love me so,
Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?
Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. 
Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  On the Super Best Friends power cycles! 
Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?
Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?
Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends! 
His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it.
But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.
Thank you my children.  We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is  right here. On T-shirts!  Free Pussy Riot! 
Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.
Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation.
Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!
...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium.  I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded!  So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going! 
Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance.
Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. 
Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on the roof! 
You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.
Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!
Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.
Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-
I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends.  Buddha. Buddha, come in!
Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!
Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before.
This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.

I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.  Next caller.
Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!
We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.
Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...
What seems to be the problem, my child?
We have to find another weak spot!  Moses!
Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.
My son, there is no time! Do it!
There has to be a way to destroy it.  Jesus to Moses!
... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
