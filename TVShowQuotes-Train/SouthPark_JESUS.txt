Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. 
Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.  First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals' 
Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit. 
That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.
Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes.
Nobody is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!
Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.
I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud.
Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?
Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!
Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--
Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--
These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can.
That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa!  Smith! Try your ice breath! 
Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation.
We have to find another weak spot!  Moses!
Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback.
My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-
I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.
Yes. Yes, I think I do.  We need a little Christmas miracle.  Lock and load! We're goin' in!
No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?
Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.
Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance.
Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you.
Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!
Uhhh... Hi.  Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.  We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver.
Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.
Of course. I know you, my child. Come in.
Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. 
Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.
Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.
You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!
Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. 
Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.
Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30.
But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.
Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages.
If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle.
He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.
Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!
Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.
W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions.  Yes, uhh, you over there. 
This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.
The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.
Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength.
Aw, come on! I weigh more than that.
My son, there is no time! Do it!
... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends! 
Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
What are you doing out so late, kids?
NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?
Away in the manger, no crib for My bed
That's where cute little old Me lay down My sweet head.
The stars in the sky (Santa: Ooooo)
You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help.
Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before.
The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!
All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. 
Oh. Kids, yeyou believe I can beat Satan, right?
One man cannot be the voice of the Church!
Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing?  Can I help you with something? 
My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...
Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow?  ...Hello?
Shut the fuck up!  Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused. 
Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!
Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.
Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now.  This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right.
Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye to Bethlehem to see-ee Me...
A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!  Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? 
We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?
-- Yea, the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and- 
Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.
P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?
Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it.
Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. 
So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?
That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.
Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!
Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.  Yes, your comments.
Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around.  Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay now, turn back.  It is now wine!
Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod "Do You Think I'm Sexy?" Stewart! 
No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.
You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. 
Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here. 
But as long as you love me so,
Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?
Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.
I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!
I can't say I approve of this, my children.
Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. 
Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!
Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!
I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
Do you have an opinion on global warming?
Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish.
Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute. 
You're a... bad liar.  Yay. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh?
We'll never get out in time to stop him!
Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
The lights are turned way down low, so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.
Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones.  Caller, you're on the air.
There has to be a way to destroy it.  Jesus to Moses!
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon Virgin, Mother and Me.
Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?
Oh, what are you gonna do? Kwy now?
Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?
It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! 
His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it.
So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?
I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.  Next caller.
Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.
Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.
Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on the roof! 
My child,  have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad.
Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago.
Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?
Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's-
Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.
...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium.  I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded!  So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going! 
Thank you my children.  We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is  right here. On T-shirts!  Free Pussy Riot! 
Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.
Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.
I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.  In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!
So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.
If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party.
It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends.  Buddha. Buddha, come in!
Let him come then. I shall stop him!
Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? 
Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return. 
This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.
Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again.
Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  On the Super Best Friends power cycles! 
It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.
I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.
Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you.
I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.  I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment. 
Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.
But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.
Holy Me, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?
What seems to be the problem, my child?
We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!
Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?
You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.
Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions….
Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-
Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.
My children, you should know something.  I'm packing.  Let's go! 
Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.
That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.
But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!
Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.
