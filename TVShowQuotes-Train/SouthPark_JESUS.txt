Our Savior!

Il vostro bambino se arguisto. 

That's what I'm doing. 

I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter.

Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it.

P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?

This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.

But I don't really care about that.

Jesus Christ!

Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again.

Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages.

Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. 

NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?

Oh yeah?? 

Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!

Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance.

Oh - oh yeah??

Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?

We'll never get out in time to stop him!

Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.

Wuh well, yeah.

Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.

So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?

Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.

Father. You came.

Wa! 

Let him come then. I shall stop him!

Aw, come on, Santa. You can't leave.

Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?

I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.  In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!

Next caller, you're on the air.

Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!

The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.

Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you.

Not so fast, David Blaine!

Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega.  The Beginning and the End.

Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny.

Wait. Jimbo made that up?

I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud.

It's Dad.

Is that true, Stan?

Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--

Uh, you pooped your pants?

We need to get some bracelets.

Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.

Let's hope to Christ this works. 

Come in, Moses!

Uh Santa?

The lights are turned way down low, so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.

Oh.

Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag!

You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.

Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish.

Kick who to the kerb?

Okay, pal. You asked for it! 

Hold!

My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-

Give it your best sho-  Oh! 

Yeah...

That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.

Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback.

Oh, really? 

And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--

What?  Aw, shit!

The entire Vietcong Army?

O-okay, okay, that's enough.

No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.

Damien!

Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.

We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad!  Great Scott!

Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.

So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?

Poo pants?

Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know.

Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before.

Do you have an opinion on global warming?

Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.

Not yet.

I can't say I approve of this, my children.

Ohh, alright.

Anybody get the number of that truck? 

Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. 

I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.

Good. Want some peanuts?

Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here. 

Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.

Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-

If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle.

Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto.  Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.

Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!! 

Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.

The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!

Behold. The Evil One approaches.

Oh no.

Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes.

Yay, look upon me, and know me.

In nome del mio padre, siete guarito. 

Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago.

Yes my son?

Kyaaaaa!

Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones.  Caller, you're on the air.

You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!

A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!  Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? 

You're all a bunch of Judases!

Let's move. Move!

I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.

You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help.

He he hoo, get away! 

Holy Me, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.

Unless what?

Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...

Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now.  This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right.

Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's-

One man cannot be the voice of the Church!

All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. 

Who's the creepy ginger kid?

Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. 

If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party.

Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.

Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!

Oow!  Ooooooh! 

I sent her away.

Wait here, I can handle this.

Lao Tse, bring it to life. 

Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!

And heaven and nature sing...

We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!

Pff, I know, right?

There are so many of them. HAAAAA! 

Uh, let's watch the language, people.

So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?

But the fire so delightful

You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. 

On the Super Best Screen!

Thank you my children.  We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is  right here. On T-shirts!  Free Pussy Riot! 

What are you doing out so late, kids?

Well, what do ya want?

Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends! 

What are you doing?! 

Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow?  ...Hello?

My child,  have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad.

You're a... bad liar.  Yay. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh?

What?

Are you still keeping your eyes closed?

Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand! 

Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou. 

How are y'all doing tonight?

Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.

My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle!  Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around  Ya need tuh- turn around.  Okay, now turn back. 

That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.

Awgh! 

Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.

But Santa... The weather outside is frightful

Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.

You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!

Wha-what are you talking about?

Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!

Uhhh... Hi.  Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.  We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver.

Goddamnit! 

Nobody is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!

Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. 

Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.

No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?

Yes, my son.

That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.

Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.  First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals' 

Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute. 

Oh, what are you gonna do? Kwy now?

Is it?

Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. 

We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.

Oh! 

Please, Father. Do something.

W-wait, everybody. Come back.

My son...

Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory-

Cute little eight-pound me (Santa: Oo-oo)

Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on the roof! 

What seems to be the problem, my child?

Leave me alone.

Hi, Bob Denver.

We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?

What is your problem, guy?!

But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.

Get out! 

Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.  Yes, your comments.

Yes my son.

Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation.

It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.

God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.

Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! 

I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.  Next caller.

Yeah, I know how it goes.

Aslan, the evil characters are almost here!

let it snow!

And yet, somehow, he managed to survive.

It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! 

Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.

Santa? Is he alright?

What??

Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!

Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30.

O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye to Bethlehem to see-ee Me...

What?

Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.

Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.

Shut the fuck up!  Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused. 

Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?

Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing?  Can I help you with something? 

The Dark Prince?

Away in the manger, no crib for My bed
That's where cute little old Me lay down My sweet head.
The stars in the sky (Santa: Ooooo)

But as long as you love me so,

There has to be a way to destroy it.  Jesus to Moses!

Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return. 

Of course Robert. How are things now?

Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?

Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.

Look at me! I'm Jesus! Would you like me to crap on you, Mr. Bush? 

Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit. 

But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!

...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium.  I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded!  So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going! 

I heard that.

What?

Wow. That's pretty heavy.

Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!

Uuh-huh?

So, what happens at the millennium?

-to Me!
Silent Night,

Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!

Yes. Yes, I think I do.  We need a little Christmas miracle.  Lock and load! We're goin' in!

Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.

Aw, come on! I weigh more than that.

I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.

Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you.

So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.

His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it.

Well, it looks like everything worked out. 

That takes care of them.

It doesn't show signs of stoppin'.

We have to find another weak spot!  Moses!

We have to get him out of there.

Hey, Rod, great to see you.

I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!

You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys! 

Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?

Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? 

Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  On the Super Best Friends power cycles! 

I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends.  Buddha. Buddha, come in!

My children, you should know something.  I'm packing.  Let's go! 

Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.

Of course. I know you, my child. Come in.

So it is thou, Son of Lucifer!

My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.

My son, there is no time! Do it!

I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.  I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment. 

Uhhh, clever?

All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon Virgin, Mother and Me.

Popeye, I need some help here! 

Oh. Kids, yeyou believe I can beat Satan, right?

No way, dude!

Who are you to say that?! 

Aw heck.  Do I have a choice? 

Holy Night

That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa!  Smith! Try your ice breath! 

I don't know, Seaman. 

Here.  Can you walk?

This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.

Oh boy.

Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?

Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!

Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!

I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman. 

All right!

Get away.

Shhhh.

What video tapes?

He did it!

Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.

Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions….
