Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.

But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.

The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!

Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute. 

We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.

Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega.  The Beginning and the End.

This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.

Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback.

But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.

We'll never get out in time to stop him!

Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.

O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye to Bethlehem to see-ee Me...

We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!

My son, there is no time! Do it!

Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?

Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?

I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends.  Buddha. Buddha, come in!

I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.

One man cannot be the voice of the Church!

I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!

Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.

Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now.  This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right.

Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.

Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes.

Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!

Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength.

Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's-

Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.

A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!  Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? 

God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.

Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.

... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?

The lights are turned way down low, so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

We have to find another weak spot!  Moses!

Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.

W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions.  Yes, uhh, you over there. 

Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!

But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!

We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?

Of course. I know you, my child. Come in.

Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.

Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. 

Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again.

Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.  Yes, your comments.

So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?

So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.

What seems to be the problem, my child?

Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. 

Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto.  Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.

You're a... bad liar.  Yay. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh?

That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa!  Smith! Try your ice breath! 

Look at me! I'm Jesus! Would you like me to crap on you, Mr. Bush? 

Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!

Thank you my children.  We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is  right here. On T-shirts!  Free Pussy Riot! 

Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-

NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?

Yes. Yes, I think I do.  We need a little Christmas miracle.  Lock and load! We're goin' in!

All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon Virgin, Mother and Me.

The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.

There has to be a way to destroy it.  Jesus to Moses!

Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends! 

Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!

You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!

Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.

I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.  I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment. 

Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return. 

You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!

My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...

Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.

Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here. 

Holy Me, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing?  Can I help you with something? 

This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.
Commercial
Who will win our souls? . Our Savior and Lord?  Or the Prince of Darkness?  It's the final battle between Good and Evil  and it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95

Uhhh... Hi.  Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.  We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver.

Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages.

I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.

Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  On the Super Best Friends power cycles! 

His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it.

Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance.

All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. 

Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.

Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish.

My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.

Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! 

That's right, Santa, and we love each and every one of them. Like this one.
Joy to the world, for I have come.
Let earth receive Me!
Let every heart prepare Me room. 

Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it.

Yea, children. I am the way and the light...

I can't say I approve of this, my children.

P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?

Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.

What are you doing out so late, kids?

Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!

Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around.  Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay now, turn back.  It is now wine!

These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can.

I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.

And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--

Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones.  Caller, you're on the air.

Oh, what are you gonna do? Kwy now?

My children, you should know something.  I'm packing.  Let's go! 

Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.

Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions….

Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before.

Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30.

Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? 

Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...

This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.

-- Yea, the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and- 

It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.

...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium.  I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded!  So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going! 

Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. 

Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!

Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.

We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad!  Great Scott!

That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.

My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-

Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you.

That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.

Oh. Kids, yeyou believe I can beat Satan, right?

Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow?  ...Hello?

You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.

He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.

Shut the fuck up!  Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused. 

It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! 

Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?

You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. 

Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?

Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.

No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.

Aw, come on! I weigh more than that.

Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--

Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you.

So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?

Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?

Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.

If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party.

Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.

But as long as you love me so,

I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.  In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!

Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.  First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals' 

It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.

Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.

Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!

My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle!  Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around  Ya need tuh- turn around.  Okay, now turn back. 

Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.

Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.

If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle.

Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.

We have to get him out of there.

That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.

Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again.

Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?

Let him come then. I shall stop him!

I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud.

Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!

So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?

Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position.
