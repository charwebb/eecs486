Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.

Well that'll never happen.

Ooo. How d'you know?

Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris?

Hey Stan.

This is Gary.

Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?

Mingie, what're you doin'?

Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I- 

'Ow do we get proof?

Mingie, have you lost your mind?

Min...  Mingie.

Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad.

Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.

Stop wastin' my time.

My sister Jenny.

'Scuse me?

Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me?

I don't understand, Mingie.

Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us.

Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass.

I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie!

He wants to know what information we have.

Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris?

And her Gary too.

Awesome! I can't wait!

Great luau, Satan.

can pass the test. 

Sure.

Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood.

Bye!

The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday.

That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?

And my baby sister Amanda.

Hey everybody.

They got me, Mingie.

No!

Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge.

'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.

Hey Stan.

It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are really cool so... I understand if there's initiation rites.

You'd be surprised at things that can talk.

Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.

Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead!

Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!

Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!

How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid.  Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it.

I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke! 

The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel.

Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. 

You coming, Stan?

Not like this, Mingie. Not like this!

Tell me what you see, Mingie.

Oprah's got egg all over her face! She'll have to retire!

Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!

Hey Stan.

And this is my brother Mark.

Yeah!

A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole.

Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along? 

Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh.

You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.

So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!

Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.

Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?

Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family!
My family is the best!
If we ever have to face a challenge.

Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.

Hello everybody. It's relly great to meet you all.

That's funny. You're cool, man.

My little brother Dave.

Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!

Hey. My name's Gary.

So what do you guys wanna do?

Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore.
