They got me, Mingie.

Just look into the author of "A Million Little Fiyabers," and you'll discover the truth.

Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.

Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass.

My sister Jenny.

Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris?

Hallo?

Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!

The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday.

That's funny. You're cool, man.

Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad.

Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along? 

And this is my brother Mark.

My little brother Dave.

You coming, Stan?

'Ow do we get proof?

Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.

'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.

Not like this, Mingie. Not like this!

Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us.

Oh here comes my family now!

Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge.

can pass the test. 

You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.

Awesome! I can't wait!

Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore.

Hey Stan.

Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.

Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great!

That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?

Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!

Sure.

I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke! 

Great luau, Satan.

How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid.  Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it.

Stop wastin' my time.

And her Gary too.

The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel.

Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!

Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood.

I don't understand, Mingie.

A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole.

Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead!

This is Gary.

Hey everybody.

Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.

Bye!

Ooo. How d'you know?

Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. 

Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.

I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!

No!

He wants to know what information we have.

So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!

I didn't say "stop wastin' my time," Geraldo did.

Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me?

Tell me what you see, Mingie.

Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?

Hey. My name's Gary.

Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.

'Scuse me?

Mingie, have you lost your mind?

Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?

Well that'll never happen.

Hello everybody. It's relly great to meet you all.

So what do you guys wanna do?

Yeah!

Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I- 

I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie!

Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!

Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris?

And my baby sister Amanda.

Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!

Hey Stan.
