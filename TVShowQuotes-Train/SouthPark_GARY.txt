Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I- 
It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are really cool so... I understand if there's initiation rites.
Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore.
Hello everybody. It's relly great to meet you all.
Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!
Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.
Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us.
The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel.
Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.
Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood.
I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie!
'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.
The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday.
Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad.
How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid.  Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it.
I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!
Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!
Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris?
Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass.
So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!
Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along? 
Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.
Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris?
He wants to know what information we have.
Oprah's got egg all over her face! She'll have to retire!
I didn't say "stop wastin' my time," Geraldo did.
You'd be surprised at things that can talk.
Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family!
My family is the best!
If we ever have to face a challenge.
That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?
You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.
Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.
Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great!
Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead!
A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole.
Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. 
Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me?
