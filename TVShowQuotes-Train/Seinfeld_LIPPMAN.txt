It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you. (laughs)
It's the button at the top, the top.
No its the Button. Elaine
Yeah.
So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?
That's simply not true.
What?
Really?
Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man.
YesTurn it off.
Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?
Yeah Ohoo.
(correcting her) Boo-eed.
Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it?
(accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
I renounce Judaism!
You said "boyed."
Elaine,
What book?
(putting on spectacles) Oh yeah?
What?
Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.
Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!
Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?
Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?
Oh, no no no. (waves them away) Please.
You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.
How's your father?
No. e-Elaine.
I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.
That's fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Who's your publisher?
Yeah.
Get rid of the exclamation points...
Uh-huh.
Well, I got a plane to catch.
But--but he's feeling better now?
Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?
No Its Not!!
(into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? (beat) But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?
(at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour)
What?
Yeah? (to Elaine) You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?
... as such, it...
It's coming from your purse.
It-no- it's just her sense of humor.
(confused) Where... what?
I hate exclamation points...
Elaine
I see, (reads another excerpt) "I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!" Exclamation point?
Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.
You put exclamation point after sweatshirt?
Uh huh. Very unusual.
Gotta go.
Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.
Who wants cookies?
Yes.
I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this.
it-it-its her purse.
Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing.
We have got you in a very nice hotel, I-I don't know how you like to work, but ah, I can arrange for an office if you like.
Elaine
Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.
About coffee tables?
The one at the top.
You are wrong. I'll prove it.
Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.
And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.
Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?
Ah, (reads an excerpt) "It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"
Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.
(ignoring Elaine) God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?
