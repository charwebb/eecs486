Yeah.
... as such, it...
But--but he's feeling better now?
I see, (reads another excerpt) "I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!" Exclamation point?
Elaine
(confused) Where... what?
Well, I got a plane to catch.
Uh-huh.
It-no- it's just her sense of humor.
Get rid of the exclamation points...
Really?
Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man.
It's the button at the top, the top.
(entering, smoking a cigar and with a handful of cash) Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties. (hands cash to Kramer) Go ahead, count it.
So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?
(accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
About coffee tables?
The one at the top.
Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?
Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?
Oh, no no no. (waves them away) Please.
I hate exclamation points...
It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you. (laughs)
Gotta go.
Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.
That's simply not true.
What book?
It (frustrated and trying to keep her from saying more)
I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this.
Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?
(at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour)
What?
(correcting her) Boo-eed.
You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.
(into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? (beat) But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?
Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.
We have got you in a very nice hotel, I-I don't know how you like to work, but ah, I can arrange for an office if you like.
No Its Not!!
I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.
it-it-its her purse.
Elaine
You said "boyed."
Its Not
Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing.
Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.
YesTurn it off.
Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have my sports section?
No its the Button. Elaine
That's fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Who's your publisher?
Uh huh. Very unusual.
How's your father?
Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.
(ignoring Elaine) God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?
Yeah Ohoo.
Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.
Who wants cookies?
Oh.
What?
Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!
And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.
Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?
Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.
You know, Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him.
What?
You put exclamation point after sweatshirt?
Yeah.
Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it?
(putting on spectacles) Oh yeah?
Yeah? (to Elaine) You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?
Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that. (puts on glasses) You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...
Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?
