Elaine
It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you. (laughs)
It (frustrated and trying to keep her from saying more)
(confused) Where... what?
Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.
What?
Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.
(entering, smoking a cigar and with a handful of cash) Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties. (hands cash to Kramer) Go ahead, count it.
What?
Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.
Yeah.
Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?
So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?
Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it?
It-no- it's just her sense of humor.
it-it-its her purse.
(putting on spectacles) Oh yeah?
Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!
Get rid of the exclamation points...
(correcting her) Boo-eed.
Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?
You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.
You know, Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him.
The one at the top.
Really?
Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?
I see, (reads another excerpt) "I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!" Exclamation point?
Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing.
Uh-huh.
Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?
I renounce Judaism!
What?
Uh huh. Very unusual.
We have got you in a very nice hotel, I-I don't know how you like to work, but ah, I can arrange for an office if you like.
Ah, (reads an excerpt) "It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"
(ignoring Elaine) God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?
Gotta go.
I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.
You put exclamation point after sweatshirt?
That's simply not true.
Who wants cookies?
Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have my sports section?
No Its Not!!
Oh.
I hate exclamation points...
(accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
About coffee tables?
I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this.
You said "boyed."
Elaine
It's coming from your purse.
Yes.
What book?
Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that. (puts on glasses) You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...
Its Not
Yeah.
But--but he's feeling better now?
Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man.
That's fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Who's your publisher?
Well, I got a plane to catch.
Yeah? (to Elaine) You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?
Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.
Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.
Elaine,
You are wrong. I'll prove it.
Yeah Ohoo.
And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.
No its the Button. Elaine
(at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour)
How's your father?
It's the button at the top, the top.
