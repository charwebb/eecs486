We have got you in a very nice hotel, I-I don't know how you like to work, but ah, I can arrange for an office if you like.
Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.
And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.
Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?
You know, Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him.
Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?
(entering, smoking a cigar and with a handful of cash) Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties. (hands cash to Kramer) Go ahead, count it.
It's the button at the top, the top.
Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.
(ignoring Elaine) God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?
(accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that. (puts on glasses) You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...
So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?
(into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? (beat) But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?
Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.
Ah, (reads an excerpt) "It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"
Oh, no no no. (waves them away) Please.
Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.
Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.
(at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour)
I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this.
That's fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Who's your publisher?
It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you. (laughs)
I see, (reads another excerpt) "I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!" Exclamation point?
Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have my sports section?
Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?
I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.
It (frustrated and trying to keep her from saying more)
Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!
Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man.
You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.
Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing.
