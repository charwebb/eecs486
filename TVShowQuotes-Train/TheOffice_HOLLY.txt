[to Toby] What did you do to him?
[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters.
[talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper.
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.
He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'
No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.
I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off...
Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.
[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right?
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, 'oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.' Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
Well, I just have to get through the binder.
Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
Well we could put it in storage... in case.
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
Oh, that would be great. You need that.
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
Next day I found him in my bed.
...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting---'
I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
You made ourselves to be more than we were.
It's kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
Were there even cows where you grew up?
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.
No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]
No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.
[deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
[with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.'
Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
[imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.
We have to try this out on somebody.
I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.
No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke!
Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
[sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha!
So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she's just on a coffee break.
Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right.
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]
Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'
Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It's gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it's not.  I have to read from the binder.
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
No! You do not talk to him like that!
Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]
How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
What do you do in your free time?
Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs]
Well that is a very safe place for them.
No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
What if I said it wasn't up to them?
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
[reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.
Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I'll take my free stress ball too now.
Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
You never told me you made a movie.
Don't you have a sales call to go on?
Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
