No, he's not funny at all.
Oh, she's very beautiful.
Actually, I'm a lesbian.
[plants kisses all over Michael's face]
So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
No more.
[imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces?
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
Mmm. Do you like movies?
Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.
Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.
It'll probably be a total disaster, but...
Yeah, kind of.
Hey, what's up guys?
What'd you think?
I don't care, free tonight.
No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'
I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
Um, not much.
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
Hello.
Math is hard.
No! No.
No, no, I...
Hi.
You said you would.
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
That's good.
And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
I'm real.
I'm from da future.
AJ gave me that.
Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
We have to try this out on somebody.
Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...
Darryl....
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
Yeah. I love him.
What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
Michael, you don't have to buy them.
I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
I already have.
Were there even cows where you grew up?
Yeah.
Can I talk to you for a second?
[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Look at where my seats were.
Oh.
All right.
I don't think we'd have kids.
Yes. Number three.
Is he okay?
No! You do not talk to him like that!
Michael... [Michael hangs up]
Breaker one-nine, copy?
Well, I just have to get through the binder.
Oh, fancy meeting you here.
I love pie.
Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
Yeah.
Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
[with accent] Wonderful seminar!
No.  I can do it.
It's not a family.  It's a workplace.
Oh, the mall could be fun.
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
[on phone] This is Holly.
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
What if I said it wasn't up to them?
No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
Thanks.
Hey Kevin.
[chuckling] No, that's not what you're grabbing.
Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
Cool! You drive your own car?
How long could we keep that up?
Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
You know... in case if something changes.
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
Uhm.
So we kiss occasionally.
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
Mm-hmm.
Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
You are more.
[in monster voice] Oh, huggy monster!
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
Hold your breath!
You guys, it wasn't my fault.
Yeah.
Dun-der. Dun-der...
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
Hello.
Snuggles.
I don't know.
So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
It's kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
[giggles] Sorry.
Oh, God, no.
Hi.
What are you doing?
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
No more brain damage.
It's a pea shoot...
No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
I just... Um, excuse me.
Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
Next day I found him in my bed.
Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Ex-squeeze me.
[sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha!
...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting---'
We weren't in love last time.
You too.
Okay.
No.
Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?
Great.
Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
No you don't.
Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It's gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it's not.  I have to read from the binder.
Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
I missed you too.
That's so lame they didn't invite us.
You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
Well, some girls go through a phase.
Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
Sorry, Darryl.
Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
Yeah.
It's got you.
What are you doing up here?
He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'
I can imagine.
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
Here you go.
Yoga.
Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
No.
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
I know, but from seven hours away.
Spooning.
Oh that would be great.
Oh...
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
You were sleeping?  You were talking before.
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
We're only halfway?
Put....okay....
Kidding.
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
No.
[imitates a squeaky bed] [laughter]
We live together.
Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
You are.
No.
Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Mmm.
Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.
Yeah.
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
Do you need some help?
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
I don't know.
Listen about earlier ...
I have no idea.
Yes.
No.
It was blue cheese dressing.
Oh that is so sweet.
That is correct!
Okay, yeah.
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
Yeah.
Would you put those out?
In Summer.
Of course. Yeah.
Look, Darryl, lip up.
What do you do?
So, I've gone over corporate policy.
There's too much distance.
Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
Hi.
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
I'm Robert Dunder.
No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
And I like you too.
You still gonna be mean to me?
You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
Ahoy.
Okay, one more quick one.
Okay.
Why?
We punish her?
You're shaking. Are you all right?
Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
Well we could put it in storage... in case.
He is not an idiot!
Yes.
How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Michael, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
Bye.
That is correct!
Two people in love?
Obesity-caused illnesses.
I don't know.
Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
We don't know that.
[tool clicking] Damn it!
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Sounds good.
Okay.
I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
Michael, are you okay?
What do you do in your free time?
Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
Uh... which part?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
Are their egg rolls really that big?
[playing cards] It's time to go.
Yeah.
Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
All right.
Mh hmm.
It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
No, hey.
Oh, that's our Zen garden.
I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off...
Nope.
Yeah?
What am I saying?
Oh, of course you are.
[imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
You think this is funny?
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.
Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
You OK?  You seem kind of...
10 dollars.
It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
I don't think he's funnier than me.
Really?
Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
What happened here?
We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
Okay, great.  I got it.
[as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh]
20
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
Oh I already bought this...
I love you too.
Oh, it's just later.
I love you.
Mm-hmm.
[kisses his temple] Thank you.
Hi.
[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
Yeah.
No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke!
Great.
I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]
Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.
Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Get a life!
Wow! Nice.
Oh, I think that makes us neighbors.
Yep. Just like you.
I've dated four guys last year too.
So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
Ok.
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
Oh.
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Um... Y-yeah. Okay.
Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]
Well who do you have?
I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
What's up?
Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
Which way did he go?
Yeah.
No.
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
No, I don't think so.
Down, and give me 50!
Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
[imitating E.T.] Bummer.
Oh.
You made ourselves to be more than we were.
Yeah.
Well-
13 dollars.
How's she doing?
Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
Yeah.
You're better than betterest.
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
Oh... when did you get here?
Don't you have a sales call to go on?
Oh--- no no no.
[on phone] Hello there!
Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
No. No... no Dad.
No.
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
A little lower.
Oh I'm going.
Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
Ooh!
I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
Who ahh?
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
No.
You're crazy, go crazy.
Not bad.
[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
What?
Good.
A lot of people.
Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.
I love you.
Uhm...
Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
I love the view.
It would help.
Thank you, you too.
Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.
Darryl didn't want any?
Really?
I'm sorry about your friend.
Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
Michael.. [they both laugh]
Yeah, that's good.
Oh, good for you.
[Yoda voice] Oh you mean this?
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Almost got you.
Ohh. Can you get lower?
Yeah, lets go grab them.
Michael called Dad?
[unlocking front door] This is me here.
I remember.
Well, no. Dwight...
Why?
[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
[with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
Crystal cool.
Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.
[overdramatically] Acting!
Well, what do you like to eat?
Okay.
[reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
I do, I think so.
I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.
Ooh, uh...
He knows how to get things. He got me.
Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
For what?
Honey, he's a jerk.
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.
Hindsight.
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Yeah, okay. [extends hand to Kevin]
Michael....
Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she's just on a coffee break.
No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Uh, what?
[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
Michael, I should get back to work.
Nice
Okay. Bye.
Ahh!
She's with Angela.
Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
Mmhmm.
Oh, thanks. I should check that out.
Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi.
Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
Ok.
Almost, Kevin.
Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right.
[laughs] Okay. So good to see you.
I love you too.
It's not gonna work.
Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
Dunder Mifflin.
Let me see.
Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
No.
Let's check there.
Hey there.
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.
In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right?
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
Oh...
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
What do you do here?
You'll be okay
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
Yeah.
Yeah, it was nice.
I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
I know.
Not worried about that.
Hi Dad.
I knew that. OK, bye.
I am?
Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
Yeah, thanks.
Michael I think this is our fault.
[as Curly] I most certainly am.
Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
Unnnnnnngh!
There weren't any laughs.
I loved it.
I'm sorry.
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
What? What are you talking about?
Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
That's certainly opinionated.
Yes, Michael?
It's Mike-raculous.
Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
I don't think we could enforce that.
Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
No, I understand.
Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I'll take my free stress ball too now.
You're better.
Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
Mmm.
Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
You're not touching me.
Yeah.
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
Man, someone doesn't like H.R.
Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
Well, I'm glad we did it.
Hey.
Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
What ah you wicked smaht?
And here.
Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
You do?
No. Mom?
Oh, wow... you went together?
No, you.
No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]
Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
Can I sit?
I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
No this is Holly.
I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
What? AJ!
You must be Todd.
Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
All right.
Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, 'oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.' Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
What's protocol on this?
[hugging Michael] Oh, snuggles!
Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters.
[deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
Oh. Good for you guys.
Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
No, don't touch.
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
Okay.
I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
You will.
What was the dilemma?
Well, I'll be around.
Years?
Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
[to Toby] What did you do to him?
Yeah.
Well that is a very safe place for them.
So you missed something really big.
Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
No touching.
No, you can have your own opinion.
I can't wait.
Wikka wikka wikka what?
Oh, it's very nice.
Hmm...
Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
Oh.
You never told me you made a movie.
[laughs] Lovitz.
[shakes head] No more.
Did Todd tell you to do that?
