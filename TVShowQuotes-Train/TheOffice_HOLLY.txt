Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke!
[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.'
[with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]
[talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper.
He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'
Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
[reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.
[deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...
Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right?
Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
What if I said it wasn't up to them?
Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right.
[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.
No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
[sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha!
I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
Were there even cows where you grew up?
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
[imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs]
Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]
Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
Well that is a very safe place for them.
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.
No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
What do you do in your free time?
Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I'll take my free stress ball too now.
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
It's kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'
If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off...
Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
You never told me you made a movie.
...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting---'
Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters.
Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.
Can I talk to you for a second?
You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
Next day I found him in my bed.
Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
You made ourselves to be more than we were.
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
We have to try this out on somebody.
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.
Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
Well, I just have to get through the binder.
It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
[to Toby] What did you do to him?
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.
Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
Don't you have a sales call to go on?
Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.
Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.
Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she's just on a coffee break.
Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]
Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
Well we could put it in storage... in case.
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
