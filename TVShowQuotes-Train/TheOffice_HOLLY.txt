[unlocking front door] This is me here.
He is not an idiot!
What do you do?
Don't you have a sales call to go on?
No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
Oh that is so sweet.
Get a life!
He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'
[Yoda voice] Oh you mean this?
Yeah.
Michael, I'm sorry.
How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Not bad.
[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
That's certainly opinionated.
[giggles] Sorry.
Not worried about that.
Ahh!
I'm going out with you.
I knew that. OK, bye.
So, I've gone over corporate policy.
[imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
AJ gave me that.
[laughs] Okay. So good to see you.
I have no idea.
And I like you too.
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I'll take my free stress ball too now.
Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Uh, what?
He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
Oh, that would be great. You need that.
I already have.
You said you would.
[as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh]
What if I said it wasn't up to them?
You guys, it wasn't my fault.
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
It's not gonna work.
Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right.
Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.
No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'
Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
Okay. Good night.
Oh... when did you get here?
Mmm. Do you like movies?
I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
Oh, wow... you went together?
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
Hey! Good movie.
In Summer.
Snuggles.
Ohh. Can you get lower?
No, I understand.
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
Oh, of course you are.
Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...
Lemonade sounds great.
[enters conference room] Hello.
You're crazy, go crazy.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, good for you.
Put....okay....
[playing cards] It's time to go.
Well, what do you like to eat?
No more.
Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
I loved it.
Did Todd tell you to do that?
Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]
I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]
Michael, are you okay?
There weren't any laughs.
Michael, I should get back to work.
Ahoy.
You are.
Why?
Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
Who ahh?
Oh I'm going.
No, no, I...
Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
Oh.
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
What happened here?
[tool clicking] Damn it!
Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
Oh. Good for you guys.
I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
[shakes head] No more.
Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
Obesity-caused illnesses.
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.
Look at where my seats were.
It's kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
What's up?
[talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper.
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Dieting's only half of it.
Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
Well-
Two people in love?
I'm Robert Dunder.
So you missed something really big.
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke!
And here.
I don't know.
Do you need some help?
Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.
Hindsight.
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Look I need to talk to you.
That is correct!
It's not a family.  It's a workplace.
[with accent] Wonderful seminar!
Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
Well, I just have to get through the binder.
Yep. Just like you.
I just... Um, excuse me.
Okay.
Were there even cows where you grew up?
How's she doing?
It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
Yes. Number three.
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
Michael, you don't have to buy them.
Yeah.
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
Yeah.
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
[kisses his temple] Thank you.
No, you.
Well who do you have?
Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
No, don't touch.
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
Michael... [Michael hangs up]
It's the gas station on Benet Street?
No.
[as Curly] I most certainly am.
So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
It was just for a few weeks!
That's good.
You are more.
So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
Look, Darryl, lip up.
Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
Oh...
They didn't know?
All right.
You're better.
Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
[imitating E.T.] Holly misses old phone.
Well, no. Dwight...
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
Uhm...
Great.
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
You were sleeping?  You were talking before.
Yeah.
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
[reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
Ex-squeeze me.
I remember.
Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi.
We have to try this out on somebody.
Listen about earlier ...
No.
I'm from da future.
Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
Sorry, Darryl.
What? What are you talking about?
[imitates a squeaky bed] [laughter]
You're shaking. Are you all right?
No, you can have your own opinion.
So we kiss occasionally.
That's so lame they didn't invite us.
How long could we keep that up?
Yeah.
Hi Dad.
We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Yeah, kind of.
Yeah, lets go grab them.
It'll probably be a total disaster, but...
[plants kisses all over Michael's face]
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
Yeah?
Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
Well, I'm glad we did it.
No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
What? AJ!
I've dated four guys last year too.
Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
Okay.
I love you.
Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
Hey, what's up guys?
Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.
You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
No.
Oh, God, no.
Yeah.
No, we're gonna do the long-distance thing.
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
Ok.
Hello.
Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
Down, and give me 50!
Oh, thanks. I should check that out.
Let's check there.
Okay.
13 dollars.
Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
You too.
No. No... no Dad.
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
No this is Holly.
I can imagine.
Okay, great.  I got it.
Next day I found him in my bed.
[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.
I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
No! No.
A lot of people.
I know.
I don't know.
Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Yeah, okay. [extends hand to Kevin]
She's with Angela.
Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
Oh, good.
I love you.
I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
No! You do not talk to him like that!
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
No touching.
Breaker one-nine, copy?
Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]
Yeah.
Almost got you.
Hey there.
No.
Hey Kevin.
A chastity belt.
It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.
There's too much distance.
Okay, yeah.
Honey, he's a jerk.
[to camera] No, he didn't.
Yeah.
Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.
For what?
[imitating E.T.] Bummer.
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
Oh, that's our Zen garden.
Oh.
What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
A little lower.
Actually, I'm a lesbian.
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
You know... in case if something changes.
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
You'll be okay
Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.
Yeah.
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
Really?
Would you put those out?
Spooning.
I can't wait.
Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]
I love pie.
Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
Mh hmm.
What am I saying?
Oh.
Hello.
Mmm.
Of course. Yeah.
Okay. Bye.
Oh.
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
Yeah.
No, I don't think so.
No.
Okay.
They're warm.
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
Well we could put it in storage... in case.
What do you do here?
You OK?  You seem kind of...
Mmm hmm.
Yeah, it was nice.
Crystal cool.
No.
All right.
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
Oh, fancy meeting you here.
Which way did he go?
I am?
[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters.
Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
Oh, it's very nice.
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
You're not touching me.
And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
Oh, she's very beautiful.
We punish her?
What do you do in your free time?
Oh, I think that makes us neighbors.
Yoga.
Michael.. [they both laugh]
Let me see.
What?
No.
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
Wow! Nice.
Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
Yeah.
No.
Well, some girls go through a phase.
[Brooklyn accent] You ahh.
Um... Y-yeah. Okay.
Is he okay?
[laughs] Lovitz.
Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
Hold your breath!
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.
Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs]
I know, but from seven hours away.
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
No, hey.
And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
Mmm.
Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
Yeah, that's good.
Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
I love you too.
Ooh, uh...
[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
No more brain damage.
Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?
It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
Oh that would be great.
Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
Really?
Oh I already bought this...
Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?
I'm real.
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
You're better than betterest.
Yeah.
I love you too.
Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
[with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
Oh, no.
I don't think we'd have kids.
Michael....
[laughs] I can't wait.
Dun-der. Dun-der...
Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
[overdramatically] Acting!
...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting---'
I don't know.
Kidding.
[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
What's protocol on this?
Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she's just on a coffee break.
He knows how to get things. He got me.
Great.
Bye.
[sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha!
Yes, Michael?
Years?
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
[to Toby] What did you do to him?
Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.'
The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
What's wrong?
Okay.
Well, I'll be around.
Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.
I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.
[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
Nice
Darryl....
Um, not much.
No, he's not funny at all.
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
[imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces?
Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
What was the dilemma?
Michael called Dad?
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.
Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
That is correct!
Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
You think this is funny?
It's Mike-raculous.
Can I sit?
Ooh!
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
Man, someone doesn't like H.R.
We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
How do you know when its time?
It was blue cheese dressing.
Here you go.
We weren't in love last time.
Oh--- no no no.
It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
[deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
You will.
Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
I don't care, free tonight.
You never told me you made a movie.
Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Uhm.
What are you doing up here?
It would help.
Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
I'm sorry about your friend.
I missed you too.
I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
Darryl didn't want any?
Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It's gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it's not.  I have to read from the binder.
We're only halfway?
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, 'oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.' Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
No.  I can do it.
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Wikka wikka wikka what?
Cool! You drive your own car?
You still gonna be mean to me?
We live together.
We don't know that.
Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.
It's got you.
I don't think we could enforce that.
I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]
Unnnnnnngh!
I do, I think so.
Well that is a very safe place for them.
Can I talk to you for a second?
[chuckling] No, that's not what you're grabbing.
Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
Hi.
Thanks.
Uh... which part?
No, this is Michael Scott.
Mm-hmm.
Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
Hmm...
This is your moms old stuff?
No you don't.
What ah you wicked smaht?
Why?
No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
Hi.
Yes.
Oh.
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
20
Oh...
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
Yeah. I love him.
Yeah.
Well you don't have to agree.
Ok.
Yeah.
[in monster voice] Oh, huggy monster!
10 dollars.
No. Mom?
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
Yeah.
Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
Sounds good.
[hugging Michael] Oh, snuggles!
