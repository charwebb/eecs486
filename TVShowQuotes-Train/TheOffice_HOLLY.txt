No, this is Michael Scott.
You'll be okay
I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
He is not an idiot!
Oh, wow... you went together?
We have to try this out on somebody.
Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
I'm Robert Dunder.
Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
It was blue cheese dressing.
Okay.
You're shaking. Are you all right?
I have no idea.
[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
I know, but from seven hours away.
No! You do not talk to him like that!
Oh, no.
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
[in monster voice] Oh, huggy monster!
Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.
Well, what do you like to eat?
Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
No you don't.
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
Honey, he's a jerk.
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
Well-
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
I just... Um, excuse me.
What am I saying?
Oh, I think that makes us neighbors.
No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]
Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Hey Kevin.
Oh I already bought this...
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Oh.
[imitates a squeaky bed] [laughter]
Hi.
Yeah.
No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
It was just for a few weeks!
That is correct!
Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
Yes.
Obesity-caused illnesses.
[on phone] This is Holly.
Oh, fancy meeting you here.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
Michael... [Michael hangs up]
Hi Dad.
Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
Ahoy.
She's with Angela.
Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
You're crazy, go crazy.
Well, no. Dwight...
Get a life!
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
I can imagine.
Yeah, thanks.
Michael, are you okay?
No, you can have your own opinion.
Hello.
Snuggles.
[laughs] Lovitz.
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
I'm sorry about your friend.
No.
Yeah.
You romanticize things.
It's not gonna work.
Oh that would be great.
I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Michael, you don't have to buy them.
Oh.
Well, I just have to get through the binder.
We're only halfway?
Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
No more.
[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
Math is hard.
[talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper.
Oh, thanks. I should check that out.
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.
Two people in love?
Oh, she's very beautiful.
Here you go.
I'm from da future.
What do you do in your free time?
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Ooh, uh...
Ahh!
Okay.
No, he's not funny at all.
Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
Are their egg rolls really that big?
10 dollars.
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
You are more.
[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.
[to camera] No, he didn't.
[reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?
Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
Oh no no no. I'll be fine.
Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
It's Mike-raculous.
Uh, what?
It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.
Look, Darryl, lip up.
What's protocol on this?
You must be Todd.
I can't wait.
Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
And I like you too.
I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
Mm-hmm.
[kisses his temple] Thank you.
[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.
What ah you wicked smaht?
No, I don't think so.
No, no, I...
Great.
Ok.
Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.
Ooh!
We punish her?
I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
I'm going out with you.
Oh.
Great.
Ohh. Can you get lower?
Uh... which part?
[unlocking front door] This is me here.
Michael, I should get back to work.
No.
Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
Okay.
Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
No.
What are you doing up here?
You think this is funny?
Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.
I don't know.
Okay, one more quick one.
Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
No. Mom?
Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It's gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it's not.  I have to read from the binder.
[as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh]
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
I am?
Yeah, that's good.
Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
I loved it.
Yeah.
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
Next day I found him in my bed.
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
...Hell yeah.
Oh. Good for you guys.
No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
[laughs] Okay. So good to see you.
No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'
That's good.
I don't think he's funnier than me.
Yeah.
Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Oh, good for you.
Not bad.
Sorry, Darryl.
No, hey.
I'm sorry.
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
A little lower.
Not worried about that.
Okay, yeah.
20
Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right?
Oh I'm going.
And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
Oh.
Sounds good.
No more brain damage.
Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters.
Wikka wikka wikka what?
Yeah, it was nice.
Michael I think this is our fault.
Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.
Um, not much.
I don't think we'd have kids.
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, 'oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.' Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
Yeah.
Dunder Mifflin.
Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
Yeah, lets go grab them.
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
Spooning.
He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'
No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.
What happened here?
Why?
What do you do?
No.
Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.
Hi.
Of course. Yeah.
Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
Mmm.
I don't care, free tonight.
AJ gave me that.
I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
What?
Mmm hmm.
[playing cards] It's time to go.
You're not touching me.
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
Yes, Michael?
We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
Yeah, kind of.
[giggles] Sorry.
What? What are you talking about?
Um... Y-yeah. Okay.
Don't you have a sales call to go on?
What are you doing?
Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?
You are.
Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
Dieting's only half of it.
You guys, it wasn't my fault.
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Cool! You drive your own car?
I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.
Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
Oh, it's just later.
Okay. Good night.
Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
Kidding.
It would help.
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
You said you would.
Thank you, you too.
There's too much distance.
Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
[Brooklyn accent] You ahh.
No touching.
How's she doing?
Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
It'll probably be a total disaster, but...
Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
You were sleeping?  You were talking before.
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
There weren't any laughs.
Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]
It's a pea shoot...
Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]
Who ahh?
Is he okay?
I love you.
No.  I can do it.
No.
Did Todd tell you to do that?
We don't know that.
You OK?  You seem kind of...
Uhm...
Really?
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
I don't think we could enforce that.
[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
No, we're gonna do the long-distance thing.
You still gonna be mean to me?
We live together.
Years?
I'm real.
I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.
Yep. Just like you.
It's kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
Darryl didn't want any?
Okay, great.  I got it.
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
That-That's my car.
No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke!
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
Mmm. Do you like movies?
I know.
Ok.
You're better.
You made ourselves to be more than we were.
I love you.
What'd you think?
Mmm.
Okay. Bye.
It's got you.
Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
It's not a family.  It's a workplace.
Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right.
Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
You will.
Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.
Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
Good.
Well that is a very safe place for them.
Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
Down, and give me 50!
I don't know.
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
Hey there.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
Hey, what's up guys?
Michael.. [they both laugh]
Let's check there.
Hello.
How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Yes. Number three.
[sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha!
I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
Oh, good.
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
I don't know.
Yeah?
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
Yeah.
Michael....
Can I sit?
Do you need some help?
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
What was the dilemma?
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
[hugging Michael] Oh, snuggles!
Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
Would you put those out?
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
Look at where my seats were.
Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
Oh... when did you get here?
I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
Oh--- no no no.
Oh, that's our Zen garden.
Ex-squeeze me.
Hi.
I remember.
Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
Well, I'll be around.
[imitating E.T.] Holly misses old phone.
How do you know when its time?
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Yeah.
No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
Actually, I'm a lesbian.
I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
[on phone] Hello there!
Crystal cool.
All right.
Hindsight.
I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off...
Yeah.
He knows how to get things. He got me.
He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
Michael, I'm sorry.
Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.
So we kiss occasionally.
Michael called Dad?
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
So, I've gone over corporate policy.
Put....okay....
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
Uhm.
[laughs] I can't wait.
Mmhmm.
[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
No, you.
[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]
[plants kisses all over Michael's face]
No this is Holly.
Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
No.
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
Dun-der. Dun-der...
Yeah, okay. [extends hand to Kevin]
And here.
Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she's just on a coffee break.
Were there even cows where you grew up?
Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
[as Curly] I most certainly am.
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
Thanks.
It's the gas station on Benet Street?
[overdramatically] Acting!
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
You never told me you made a movie.
No.
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
[shakes head] No more.
13 dollars.
Yeah.
And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
Almost got you.
Mh hmm.
[imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces?
[tool clicking] Damn it!
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I'll take my free stress ball too now.
You know... in case if something changes.
Oh, that would be great. You need that.
Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
Nope.
Oh, the mall could be fun.
What? AJ!
Oh, it's very nice.
No, don't touch.
Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
What do you do here?
For what?
That is correct!
I love pie.
I love the view.
Yeah.
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.
Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.'
That's so lame they didn't invite us.
A chastity belt.
Breaker one-nine, copy?
Well you don't have to agree.
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
In Summer.
Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi.
Let me see.
I missed you too.
What's up?
We weren't in love last time.
Why?
Yeah.
All right.
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
No, I understand.
Hey.
Well, some girls go through a phase.
[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
That's certainly opinionated.
They're warm.
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
I've dated four guys last year too.
A lot of people.
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
They didn't know?
This is your moms old stuff?
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
Unnnnnnngh!
I knew that. OK, bye.
Really?
Yeah.
Nice
What if I said it wasn't up to them?
[imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
[enters conference room] Hello.
[Yoda voice] Oh you mean this?
Well who do you have?
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
No.
Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
[to Toby] What did you do to him?
What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
Oh...
You do?
You're better than betterest.
Look I need to talk to you.
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
Oh, of course you are.
Hmm...
[with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
Yeah. I love him.
Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.
[deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
I love you too.
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
You too.
