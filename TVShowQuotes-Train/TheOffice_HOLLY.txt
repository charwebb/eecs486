Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.
Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters.
[reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I'll take my free stress ball too now.
Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Well that is a very safe place for them.
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]
Well, I just have to get through the binder.
Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.
Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.
Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'
I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.
You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
[talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper.
Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.'
Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Well we could put it in storage... in case.
[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
We have to try this out on somebody.
Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'
Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
[deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
No! You do not talk to him like that!
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs]
Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It's gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it's not.  I have to read from the binder.
No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, 'oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.' Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
What if I said it wasn't up to them?
Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
[to Toby] What did you do to him?
Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.
We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right.
Don't you have a sales call to go on?
[imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.
Oh, that would be great. You need that.
Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke!
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she's just on a coffee break.
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting---'
I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]
It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
You made ourselves to be more than we were.
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
[with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
You never told me you made a movie.
I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right?
Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
It's kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
Next day I found him in my bed.
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
Were there even cows where you grew up?
[sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha!
You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
He knows how to get things. He got me.
Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
What do you do in your free time?
The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
