No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.
Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was.
Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it. 
What a touching and true song. You know, it's true.  Republicans are ruining the earth.
Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?
Boys, you've got... three hours to get those two back together. Do I need to remind you what will happen if you don't? Carl! 
You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.
Yes! Earth Day is saved, boys! Everything worked out after all!
Alright, we'll come off the speech about the dying whales, and thennn, action!
I'm not sure, but- uh.  Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks. 
We promised people Terrance and Phillip, not a video documentary! You've ruined the earth for the last time, boys! 
Think of all the endangered species that will now vanish because of you! Carl! 
H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie.
Alright. Well, I think I know why most of you tuned in today. How about some Earth Day entertainment?!
