Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.
Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's "fun", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. 
They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?
Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.
We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is.
Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.
But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.
No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!
This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!
Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.
And that's all you know? what else did she say?
Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?
But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- 
Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!
...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.
Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. 
Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. 
Does your mom know you took her car?
Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available.
More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. 
How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!
And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? 
This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos!  There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.
They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!  You're, you know... They're posers!
Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants.  From Lowe's Home and Garden.
I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
Uugh, how could she hang out with them??
It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening. I mean, why now?
You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. 
Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo.  Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned.
Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings.  But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul.
No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.
Ugh. You spit on me, Larry.  Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.
What the hell have they done to you?
Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.
Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! 
No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.
Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was  we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader.
Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?  What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!
So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?
Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.
Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.
Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. 
I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way.
What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!
NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! 
Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. 
Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.
I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
