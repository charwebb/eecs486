Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants.  From Lowe's Home and Garden.
I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?
NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! 
What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!
I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!  You're, you know... They're posers!
...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.
Uugh, how could she hang out with them??
But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.
Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.
Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.
Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is.
All right, Count Fagula, you just do that. 
Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. 
Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?
I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's "fun", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. 
Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. 
And that's all you know? what else did she say?
We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.
No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!
Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!
No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.
Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.
No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.
And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? 
What the hell have they done to you?
Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.
It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening. I mean, why now?
I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo.  Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned.
This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!
This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos!  There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.
More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. 
Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! 
Ugh. You spit on me, Larry.  Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.
But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- 
Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.
Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings.  But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul.
So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?
You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.
Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?  What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!
Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. 
Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.
If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way.
The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?
Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.
Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. 
Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. 
Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available.
