Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.

What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?

I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.

If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way.

Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. 

Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.

The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?

NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! 

Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings.  But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul.

No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.

Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! 

Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.

Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.

Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.

More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?

Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's "fun", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. 

What the hell have they done to you?

Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. 

Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. 

Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.

This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos!  There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.

What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!

This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!

Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?

You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!

Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo.  Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned.

...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.

Look, we  summoned you to help us save the world!

But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- 

All right, Count Fagula, you just do that. 

We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.

Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants.  From Lowe's Home and Garden.

It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening. I mean, why now?

No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.

Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. 

How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!

Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.

Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?  What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!

Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was  we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader.

Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. 

But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.

Ugh. You spit on me, Larry.  Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.

You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. 

Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.

Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. 

No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!

And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? 

They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!  You're, you know... They're posers!

Does your mom know you took her car?

Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!

Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is.

And that's all you know? what else did she say?

So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?

I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.

Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.

I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
