Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was  we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader.
Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.
Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.
Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.
I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!
Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!
Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. 
Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. 
Does your mom know you took her car?
Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. 
You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.
So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?
How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!
Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants.  From Lowe's Home and Garden.
Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.
This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos!  There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.
I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
Ugh. You spit on me, Larry.  Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.
Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is.
You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. 
Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.
What the hell have they done to you?
Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.
No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!
Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. 
More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's "fun", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. 
This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!
Look, we  summoned you to help us save the world!
Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. 
They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!  You're, you know... They're posers!
No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.
I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?
If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way.
Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.
Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo.  Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned.
All right, Count Fagula, you just do that. 
Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.
Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings.  But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul.
NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! 
We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?
Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. 
Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.
But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.
Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?  What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!
I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? 
What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?
And that's all you know? what else did she say?
Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.
Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
