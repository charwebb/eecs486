They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!  You're, you know... They're posers!

That's a huge fucking difference!

Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's "fun", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. 

And that's all you know? what else did she say?

Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?

Ugh. You spit on me, Larry.  Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.

No, see, you're nihilistic.

This fuckin' bitch, man.

Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. 

Ugly! (ugly ugly ugly ugly)

Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.

Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.

Oh my God! They're totally different!

Dude! Michael, are you okay?

Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available.

Whoa... That's pretty hardcore. 

Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!

Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is.

Michael?! You here?

You should probably get out of here. 

Yeah, pull over here. 

What the hell are those kids doing?

I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.

Whattaya mean?

I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.

Hey uh, excuse me?

I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.

This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos!  There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.

No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.

Hey, these are just plants.

Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding.

What?? 

Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!

What the hell have they done to you?

They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!

No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!

Dude, you haven't drank your coffee. 

Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! 

Not now, lady, we're really depressed.

Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.

Really. Do you guys even smoke?

So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?

Oh my Gohhd.

We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.

What?!

What are you talking about?

No way.

Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.

Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!

Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was  we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader.

Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants.  From Lowe's Home and Garden.

This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!

You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. 

...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.

Did she just call us emos?

We aren't trying to be popular!

Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings.  But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul.

Yeah.

God, he is such a downer! 

More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?

Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.

I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.

Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. 

Are they trying to be Goth?

What's VHS?

How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!

Hello?

Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. 

Thank you!

And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? 

Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. 

Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.

Whoa...

Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.

But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.

Uugh, how could she hang out with them??

I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.

It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening. I mean, why now?

You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!

Look, we  summoned you to help us save the world!

Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.

If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way.

What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!

The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?

Did you know about this?

But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- 

Uh, yeah, it kind of does.

NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! 

Yeah. We just got Goth-served.

Does your mom know you took her car?

Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?  What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!

Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.

Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?

Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.

Right!

No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.

What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?

Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.

It's about freaking time. 

I promise.
