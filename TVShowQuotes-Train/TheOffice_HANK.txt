Hello?
I don't think he's gonna take anything.
Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open.
Here's your badge.
This ends now!
Come on man, let's, let's go.
On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.
I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some [bleep] in the break room when you're through.
Welcome, start your morning right with a burst of blueberry. Or try plain.
Thank you. Thank you. You know, it's nice and warm up here.
I don't know what that is.
[drives up to parking lot to notice all the office cars are gone] Son of a bitch.
So what are we talking about?
Where are they?
[inspects the copier] Hmm.
Is that the copier?
[on phone]  Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks!
I don't think so.
Eight dollars.
Hey! Are those skateboarders back?
Got a call about a problem up here.
Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? [Pam nods] You don't think he could've used... it couldn't have been...
No, I don't have a gun.
Look, you want to order something?
I know what a surplus is.
Two.
Thank you.
I'll get ready to leave.
Yes ma'am.
What? That ain't right.
Okay Michael.
Hmm, not much lumbar support.
Well, let me finish.
Yeah.
...Let me see the copier again.
What?
I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.
So, there's no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.
[on phone] Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks!
Yeah.
