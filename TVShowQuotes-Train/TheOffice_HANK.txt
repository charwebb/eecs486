On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.
I don't think so.
So what are we talking about?
Here's your bottle of sparkling cider.
No, I don't have a gun.
Yeah.
[on phone]  Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks!
Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open.
Dwight said this entry was a waste of space.
Welcome, start your morning right with a burst of blueberry. Or try plain.
Here's your badge.
I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.
...Let me see the copier again.
Yeah.
Come on man, let's, let's go.
Got a call about a problem up here.
Hello?
I don't think he's gonna take anything.
Look, you want to order something?
I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some [bleep] in the break room when you're through.
Hey! Are those skateboarders back?
What? That ain't right.
You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.
Okay Michael.
[on phone] Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks!
This ends now!
Thank you. Thank you. You know, it's nice and warm up here.
Where are they?
Yes ma'am.
What?
So, there's no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.
Eight dollars.
I don't know what that is.
Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? [Pam nods] You don't think he could've used... it couldn't have been...
[inspects the copier] Hmm.
I know what a surplus is.
Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.
Two.
Hmm, not much lumbar support.
[drives up to parking lot to notice all the office cars are gone] Son of a bitch.
