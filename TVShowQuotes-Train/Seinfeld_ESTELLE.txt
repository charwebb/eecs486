(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
We were just being nice.
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
Sorry to bother you, Judge.
Uh... the phone broke.
(From another room) Good for you, Lloyd!
George?
Where do you get your genes from?!
So, how are ya, Jerry?
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
Georgie.
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
Where am I going to sleep?
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
You dont feel well?
This is the best thing we ever did.
Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
Here's your omelet.
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
All right...
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
I am, too!
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
The first game?!
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
How many times can you check the car?
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
George, where are you going?!
What extremities?
Did he say "Assman"?
Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
Is it safe to come in?
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
Well, come on!
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
I can't! (screams) I can't!
I thought you were Chinese!!
What's this.
What did you say?
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
Ah forget about them let's just...
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
Oh, I don't care.
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
You think they're coming tonight?
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
I can't tonight, I'm busy.
Sid Farkus.
(Looking at it) Yeah, what is it?
You know how to write?
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
What are you doing here?
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
I want you to go see somebody.
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
Leave him alone!
My coffee table!
Maybe they don't like us.
Georgie. Come here and say hello.
Don't upset me! I can't cry!
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
I pulled it. It doesn't go.
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
It's mine. I'm his mother.
Oh, my God!
Well... then... that changes everything!
Dinner's ready!
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
I'm sorry.
So what?
(From other room) It's junk.
(shouts) You're driving me crazy!
Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.
(giggles) Yes. Who are you...?
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
Oh my goodness.
Here, here's the bra.
(To George) How much is there?!
I know, we were looking at the brochure.
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
Oh, I can't help it!
He doesn't know anything about bras.
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
Hello Seinfelds.
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
Phil Casacof?
I did not smother him.
(Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful.
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
Hello, hello!
(gasps)
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
(on TV) Georgie.
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
I don't swim.
Jerry, did you hear this?
Your father's right. It's beautiful.
Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?
That's the way I always make it.
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
(answers the door) Lloyd?
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
We're moving to Florida.
Physically?
Alright Frank that's enough.
I think you can take him, Georgie!
So what are you gonna do?!
(Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
Oh!
Oh, it was good seeing you.
Oh, really?
(shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
Are you trying to get rid of us?
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
She was a lovely woman.
This is the only time the doctor *has*.
You know
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
I think they are made from lycra-spandex.
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
He looks ridiculous in that thing...
We forgot to bring it in.
Georgie's right. (pats him on the cheek)
You're not Chinese!?!?
Oh, okay.
George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
I don't bet.
Are you sure you're talking about George?
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
What does he want with your swim trunks?
Big? No, just my height.
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
(Getting angry) I said milky white!
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
Fusilli?
I'm having dinner with someone.
Hello
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
(looking inside of the van) Wow!
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
Frank, I'm cold!
Oh, the house looks very nice.
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
All right! All right!
I'm not betting!
Well, what are you doing?
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
Well, I'm out there, George.
He told you he liked it?
Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.
That's as far as it goes.
What is this doing on my bed?!
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
Well, you've seen pictures.
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
More stuff?!
You're back.
Hello Jerry.
Kramer, I love that shirt.
I like tap dancing.
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
I am not giving him a bra.
What's the matter with your arm?
(feigning a Chinese, muffled voice) Chinese food.
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
Somebody's at the door.
Oh, hello Elaine!
I can't sleep in there!
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
(reading the bra) 100% lycra-spandex.
(on TV) Stop squirming.
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
Georgie, can you zip me up?
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
Uh, Bakersoll.
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
(From another room ) You're late!
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
(shocked) Oh, my god!
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
You got ketchup on it!
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
People take buses to get that rye.
(Yelling) George likes the bananas!
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
(calmly) We're not getting divorced.
(answering the phone) Hello?
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
Georgie, I'm a divorcee.
Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?
(steps back, appalled) You're not Chinese!
The NBC guy liked it?
Alright, let's go.
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
All right, I'll get a bra.
The proctologist? Are you okay?
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
(shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie!
So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
I don't like that tie.
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
They picked up the show?
So, is your father excited about coming home?
It was that Chinese woman.
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?
I told you to fix that thing.
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
So George, why are you here?
I want to know what youre doing in there.
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
George what are you doing in there?
