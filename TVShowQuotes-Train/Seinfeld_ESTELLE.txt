(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
I'm sorry.
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
I don't like that tie.
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
I told you to fix that thing.
(shouts) You're driving me crazy!
I know, we were looking at the brochure.
You dont feel well?
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
Maybe they don't like us.
(giggles) Yes. Who are you...?
(shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie!
(reading the bra) 100% lycra-spandex.
Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.
Well, I'm out there, George.
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
We were just being nice.
You got ketchup on it!
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
I don't swim.
What does he want with your swim trunks?
(Looking at it) Yeah, what is it?
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
Ah keep quiet.
I can't! (screams) I can't!
I pulled it. It doesn't go.
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
All right! All right!
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
Alright, let's go.
The first game?!
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?
Physically?
Is it safe to come in?
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
People take buses to get that rye.
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
So, is your father excited about coming home?
Alright Frank that's enough.
So George, why are you here?
Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
(on TV) Stop squirming.
Sorry to bother you, Judge.
Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
George what are you doing in there?
I can't sleep in there!
Oh!
Jerry, did you hear this?
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
(calmly) We're not getting divorced.
I want you to go see somebody.
Big? No, just my height.
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
I'm not betting!
(shocked) Oh, my god!
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
I think you can take him, Georgie!
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
(To George) How much is there?!
Oh, the house looks very nice.
I am, too!
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
Here, here's the bra.
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
I'm having dinner with someone.
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
Uh, Bakersoll.
Ah forget about them let's just...
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
Fusilli?
So, I'm getting an eye job.
I can't tonight, I'm busy.
What's this.
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
(gasps)
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
Well, what are you doing?
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
Phil Casacof?
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
What's the matter with your arm?
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
Are you sure you're talking about George?
Georgie's right. (pats him on the cheek)
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
(shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
Move your crap, I'm comin' in!
You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
Are you trying to get rid of us?
He looks ridiculous in that thing...
Somebody's at the door.
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
The hell with them.
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
I want to know what youre doing in there.
What is this doing on my bed?!
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
Sid Farkus.
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
I don't bet.
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
Let me put your father on the phone.
We're moving to Florida.
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
Well... then... that changes everything!
I am not giving him a bra.
All right, I'll get a bra.
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
Georgie.
Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
Where do you get your genes from?!
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
George?
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
So, how are ya, Jerry?
What did you say?
(steps back, appalled) You're not Chinese!
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
You know
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.
What extremities?
(From another room ) You're late!
It was that Chinese woman.
(Yelling) George likes the bananas!
He doesn't know anything about bras.
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
Hello, hello!
It's mine. I'm his mother.
Oh!
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
That's as far as it goes.
(warmly) Ohhh.
So what are you gonna do?!
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
Yesss?
(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
Georgie. Come here and say hello.
You're back.
I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
Ah, your father...
I thought you were Chinese!!
You're not Chinese!?!?
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
(Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful.
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
Oh, okay.
Oh my goodness.
This is the best thing we ever did.
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
George, where are you going?!
Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
(answering the phone) Hello?
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
Well, come on!
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
Georgie, can you zip me up?
Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
So what?
They picked up the show?
Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)
We forgot to bring it in.
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
You think they're coming tonight?
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.
Kramer, I love that shirt.
Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?
Well, you've seen pictures.
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
Oh, it was good seeing you.
The proctologist? Are you okay?
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
Oh, I don't care.
Don't upset me! I can't cry!
He told you he liked it?
How many times can you check the car?
(feigning a Chinese, muffled voice) Chinese food.
All right...
Frank, I'm cold!
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
Me, either.
(on TV) Georgie.
More stuff?!
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
Hello Jerry.
(shouts) Nooh!
(Getting angry) I said milky white!
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
(From another room) Good for you, Lloyd!
Dinner's ready!
That's the way I always make it.
Uh... the phone broke.
I did not smother him.
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
What are you doing here?
This is the only time the doctor *has*.
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
Hello
My coffee table!
Leave him alone!
You know how to write?
How could they have plans?
Hello Seinfelds.
(looking inside of the van) Wow!
Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
I heard noise.
With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...
She was a lovely woman.
Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.
Did he say "Assman"?
