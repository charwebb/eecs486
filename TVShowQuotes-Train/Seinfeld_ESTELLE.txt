Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
Let me put your father on the phone.
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
This is the only time the doctor *has*.
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
This is the best thing we ever did.
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
I want to know what youre doing in there.
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
How many times can you check the car?
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
What does he want with your swim trunks?
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
Are you trying to get rid of us?
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
I know, we were looking at the brochure.
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
