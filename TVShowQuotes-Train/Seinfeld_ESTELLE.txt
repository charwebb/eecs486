People take buses to get that rye.
Georgie. Come here and say hello.
Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.
Oh, I can't help it!
He doesn't know anything about bras.
I don't like that tie.
Yesss?
Where am I going to sleep?
Somebody's at the door.
I know, we were looking at the brochure.
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
(shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
Georgie's right. (pats him on the cheek)
(Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful.
(Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?
Here's your omelet.
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
Jerry, did you hear this?
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
Maybe they don't like us.
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
All right! All right!
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
Fusilli?
(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
I pulled it. It doesn't go.
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
You dont feel well?
(shouts) You're driving me crazy!
I am, too!
Ah forget about them let's just...
I think you can take him, Georgie!
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
Oh, okay.
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
Dinner's ready!
I'm having dinner with someone.
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
Well, what are you doing?
Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
(steps back, appalled) You're not Chinese!
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
Leave him alone!
The first game?!
You're back.
We were just being nice.
Physically?
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
The proctologist? Are you okay?
George what are you doing in there?
Oh, the house looks very nice.
Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)
Sorry to bother you, Judge.
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
What's the matter with your arm?
We forgot to bring it in.
He told you he liked it?
(feigning a Chinese, muffled voice) Chinese food.
I heard noise.
Let me put your father on the phone.
What's this.
I told you to fix that thing.
Oh!
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
(calmly) We're not getting divorced.
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
Oh my goodness.
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
(reading the bra) 100% lycra-spandex.
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
What did you say?
Well, come on!
Oh, hello Elaine!
Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
(shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie!
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
Uh... the phone broke.
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
Well, you've seen pictures.
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
Georgie, can you zip me up?
Hello, hello!
(warmly) Ohhh.
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
Hello Jerry.
Uh, Bakersoll.
I don't swim.
Oh, I don't care.
(To George) How much is there?!
Well, I'm out there, George.
George, where are you going?!
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
You know how to write?
(on TV) Stop squirming.
(giggles) Yes. Who are you...?
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
Is it safe to come in?
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
(Yelling) George likes the bananas!
Don't upset me! I can't cry!
You got ketchup on it!
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
I can't! (screams) I can't!
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
(From another room ) You're late!
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
I can't tonight, I'm busy.
Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
So George, why are you here?
Phil Casacof?
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
So, how are ya, Jerry?
Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)
Hello
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
Did he say "Assman"?
The hell with them.
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
This is the only time the doctor *has*.
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
You know
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
It was that Chinese woman.
We're moving to Florida.
What are you doing here?
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
All right...
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
I don't bet.
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
(shouts) Nooh!
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
That's as far as it goes.
I want to know what youre doing in there.
Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
It's mine. I'm his mother.
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
(on TV) Georgie.
Oh, my God!
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
They picked up the show?
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
Alright Frank that's enough.
Where do you get your genes from?!
She was a lovely woman.
More stuff?!
Kramer, I love that shirt.
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
What extremities?
How could they have plans?
So what?
I thought you were Chinese!!
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
Here, here's the bra.
So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.
How many times can you check the car?
So what are you gonna do?!
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
I am not giving him a bra.
Your father's right. It's beautiful.
Me, either.
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
Sid Farkus.
This is the best thing we ever did.
All right, I'll get a bra.
She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
Are you sure you're talking about George?
Oh!
I think they are made from lycra-spandex.
What does he want with your swim trunks?
(shocked) Oh, my god!
What is this doing on my bed?!
Oh, it was good seeing you.
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
Well... then... that changes everything!
My coffee table!
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
I'm sorry.
You think they're coming tonight?
I like tap dancing.
(looking inside of the van) Wow!
(From another room) Good for you, Lloyd!
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
So, I'm getting an eye job.
Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
Ah keep quiet.
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
(answers the door) Lloyd?
Hello Seinfelds.
I can't sleep in there!
He looks ridiculous in that thing...
I want you to go see somebody.
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
(Looking at it) Yeah, what is it?
(From other room) It's junk.
Are you trying to get rid of us?
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
The NBC guy liked it?
Ah, your father...
George?
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
That's the way I always make it.
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
(answering the phone) Hello?
Big? No, just my height.
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
Oh, really?
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
(gasps)
(Getting angry) I said milky white!
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
