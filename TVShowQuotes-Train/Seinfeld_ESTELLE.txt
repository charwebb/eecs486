Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
This is the best thing we ever did.
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
Let me put your father on the phone.
What does he want with your swim trunks?
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
I know, we were looking at the brochure.
I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
How many times can you check the car?
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
So, is your father excited about coming home?
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
Are you trying to get rid of us?
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
I want to know what youre doing in there.
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
