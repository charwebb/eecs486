(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
This is the best thing we ever did.
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
This is the only time the doctor *has*.
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
So, is your father excited about coming home?
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
What does he want with your swim trunks?
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
How many times can you check the car?
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
Are you trying to get rid of us?
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
I want to know what youre doing in there.
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
I know, we were looking at the brochure.
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
Let me put your father on the phone.
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
