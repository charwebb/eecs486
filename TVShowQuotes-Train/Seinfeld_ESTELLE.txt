Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
Are you trying to get rid of us?
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
How many times can you check the car?
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
I want to know what youre doing in there.
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
I know, we were looking at the brochure.
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
Let me put your father on the phone.
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
What does he want with your swim trunks?
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
So, is your father excited about coming home?
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
This is the best thing we ever did.
