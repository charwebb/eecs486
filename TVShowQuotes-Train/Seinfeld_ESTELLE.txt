Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
He doesn't know anything about bras.
My coffee table!
The first game?!
So what?
Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
You dont feel well?
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
Oh my goodness.
(on TV) Georgie.
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
(From another room ) You're late!
Big? No, just my height.
Kramer, I love that shirt.
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
I like tap dancing.
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
Georgie.
You know
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
(answering the phone) Hello?
Hello Seinfelds.
Maybe they don't like us.
I know, we were looking at the brochure.
I can't sleep in there!
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
Are you sure you're talking about George?
This is the best thing we ever did.
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
Oh, it was good seeing you.
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
(looking inside of the van) Wow!
Move your crap, I'm comin' in!
Frank, I'm cold!
Let me put your father on the phone.
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
(To George) How much is there?!
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
So what are you gonna do?!
We forgot to bring it in.
So, I'm getting an eye job.
Ah forget about them let's just...
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
This is the only time the doctor *has*.
Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
I want to know what youre doing in there.
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
(From another room) Good for you, Lloyd!
I think you can take him, Georgie!
Me, either.
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
You got ketchup on it!
Leave him alone!
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
Phil Casacof?
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
Yesss?
How many times can you check the car?
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
(reading the bra) 100% lycra-spandex.
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
(answers the door) Lloyd?
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
What extremities?
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
You're not Chinese!?!?
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
I thought you were Chinese!!
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
Georgie, I'm a divorcee.
What did you say?
I can't tonight, I'm busy.
Uh... the phone broke.
So George, why are you here?
He looks ridiculous in that thing...
You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
(giggles) Yes. Who are you...?
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
Oh, I don't care.
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
Oh, really?
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
Where do you get your genes from?!
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
I'm having dinner with someone.
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
I can't! (screams) I can't!
Oh!
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
(Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
She was a lovely woman.
I am, too!
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
Oh!
You're back.
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
We're moving to Florida.
(gasps)
It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
We were just being nice.
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
What is this doing on my bed?!
Hello Jerry.
Here's your omelet.
What does he want with your swim trunks?
Is it safe to come in?
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
Well, you've seen pictures.
I heard noise.
I'm sorry.
Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)
Oh, hello Elaine!
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
Somebody's at the door.
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
Sorry to bother you, Judge.
She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
Well... then... that changes everything!
Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
He told you he liked it?
That's the way I always make it.
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
(From other room) It's junk.
It's mine. I'm his mother.
The hell with them.
The proctologist? Are you okay?
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
So, is your father excited about coming home?
(steps back, appalled) You're not Chinese!
Jerry, did you hear this?
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
Physically?
So, how are ya, Jerry?
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
What are you doing here?
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
Oh, I can't help it!
Georgie, can you zip me up?
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
More stuff?!
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.
I am not giving him a bra.
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
(shouts) You're driving me crazy!
(on TV) Stop squirming.
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
Did he say "Assman"?
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
Well, what are you doing?
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
Fusilli?
Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
Oh, the house looks very nice.
The NBC guy liked it?
Here, here's the bra.
(shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie!
Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.
Hello
(feigning a Chinese, muffled voice) Chinese food.
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
Alright, let's go.
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
(shocked) Oh, my god!
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
Ah keep quiet.
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
Are you trying to get rid of us?
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
Ah, your father...
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.
Georgie. Come here and say hello.
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
(calmly) We're not getting divorced.
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
Oh, okay.
I pulled it. It doesn't go.
That's as far as it goes.
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
Well, I'm out there, George.
You know how to write?
It was that Chinese woman.
(shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
Georgie's right. (pats him on the cheek)
Your father's right. It's beautiful.
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
You think they're coming tonight?
I don't swim.
George what are you doing in there?
(Yelling) George likes the bananas!
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
Hello, hello!
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
I don't bet.
How could they have plans?
(Looking at it) Yeah, what is it?
What's this.
George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
All right...
Alright Frank that's enough.
(warmly) Ohhh.
Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?
(shouts) Nooh!
They picked up the show?
I think they are made from lycra-spandex.
I'm not betting!
Sid Farkus.
All right, I'll get a bra.
Don't upset me! I can't cry!
(Getting angry) I said milky white!
