Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
This is the best thing we ever did.
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
So, is your father excited about coming home?
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
How many times can you check the car?
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
Are you trying to get rid of us?
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
I want to know what youre doing in there.
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
What does he want with your swim trunks?
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
Let me put your father on the phone.
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
This is the only time the doctor *has*.
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
