That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.

Me neither.

Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?

What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!

Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!

Hello!

Except for Cartman - you can keep him.

Oh God! Huh!

They're not better, they're just more expensive.

Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.

It isn't?

What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?

Get away from meee! 

Arrgghh! They took them again!

Oh God! Oh Jesus!

Aaaah!!

You did it!

Oh God!

Agh! God, change it!!

AAH! Uh...

Wagh!

Hrrr!

Everyone in the world?! Rrrr! 

Ow!

That's my last pair of underpants! 

Jesus Christ, we killed her!

Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.

No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! 

Didn't you see them!?

Aggghhh!

Mwaaah! Slavery?

I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg! 

I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.

Haaah!

Oh God! Oh Jesus!

Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??

Rrrr!

You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!

Mine too!

...Inside my room? Oh God!

Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.

AAHH! This is it, man! It's over!

Rrrrh!

Gaaa-hah!

Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!

They're taking my underpants!

Rrrr! What a jerk!

I didn't mean to.

Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president , treasurer , and secretary  have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!

Your van? 

Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!

Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.

Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!

Oh man! This is too much pressure!

I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!

Oh man, you're a lucky guy.

Errh!

No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!

Waagh!

Oh God!

The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants. 

Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!

I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!

You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!!

Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.

Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!

They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!

Oh God!  Change it! Change it! 

Maybe they wanna kill us.

Gahahghah

No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!

Uunnnnhh!

Aaaggghhh! 

Arr!

Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this.  AAAHH!

Then your premiere has no movie!

What the hell is going on?

Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!

I'll... try.

AaaaAAAHH! 

Huh uh!

Agghh!

Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!

Herr. What do you guys want?

Why?

You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.

Wagh!

Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!

I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.

Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.

I'm not! I'm not a team player!

They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.

Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!

Waggh.

Hrrr.

You guys, we have a big problem!

Aaaah! Oh God! 

No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God.  Uh, just a dream.  OH MY GOD!!  GAAAH!! 

They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!

I'm not a chicken!

Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!

I s-I saw! Uuuh!

Rrrr! 

Fifty hats? Oh Jesus! 

Yuh-ugh!

I don't know you!  Ah, AAAH!

Oh my God they're gonna kill us. 

GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?

Oh Jesus! Huh!

...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!

Arrrr!

Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!

NOW what's happening?

You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??

Aaarr! 

Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.

He does?

What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!

Like what, then?

Huh? 

I'm not supposed to talk to you!

Uh-uh huh.

The Ghost of Human Kindness?

Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!

Oh God, no! Not Plan B! 

Huh uh.

You don't?

You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!

Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme-  I can't remember uh-the code word!

Ah, I got rubber bands. 

Nrr. What happened?

Arrrrh!

D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!

Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! 

Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!

You... guys wanted me to meet you here?

No!

Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! 

Okay.

Why?! What did I do?!

Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 

I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!

Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!  Oh Christ!  they might - could get me.

Ga-ahah!

The gnomes!

Oh God.

I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.

AAAghah heheh.

Ah, what?!

I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!

Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!

What do you want?

Cartman likes to play with dolls?

But what if I put it in the wrong place?

Aarrgghh!

NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!

There they are!

So? I don't know him!

Aaarrrnnn!

I need coffee.

They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.

Uurrgh!

Aaaahh!

No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.

Yes, just like hat!!

A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!

Conifer? Walking there would take hours!
