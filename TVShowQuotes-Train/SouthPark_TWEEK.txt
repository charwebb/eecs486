Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!
Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.
Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??
No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! 
Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!
You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!! 
Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
But what if I put it in the wrong place?
Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!
Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!
Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!  Oh Christ!  they might - could get me.
They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.
Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God.  Uh, just a dream.  OH MY GOD!!  GAAAH!! 
I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.
Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme-  I can't remember uh-the code word!
Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!
You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??
Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this.  AAAHH!
Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 
But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.
Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!
What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!
Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.
Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!
A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.
They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! 
I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!
Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!
Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! 
I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!
What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?
They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!
But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president , treasurer , and secretary  have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!
We can do our report on the gnomes.
NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!
You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!
No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!
Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
