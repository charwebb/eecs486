No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! 

But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.

...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!

But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?

Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!

A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!

Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! 

The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants. 

Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! 

Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!

No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.

Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!

Except for Cartman - you can keep him.

I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.

I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!

That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.

You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.

You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!

Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!

They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!

They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!

Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 

Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.

They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.

They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.

Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!

Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this.  AAAHH!

We can do our report on the gnomes.

I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!

But what if I put it in the wrong place?

Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!

Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.

Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!

Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!

I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!

Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.

Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!

Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.

NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!

No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!

What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?

You... guys wanted me to meet you here?

Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?

Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??

Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!

I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!

They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!

Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!

I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.

Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.

GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?
