You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!! 
Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme-  I can't remember uh-the code word!
But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
But what if I put it in the wrong place?
Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.
Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!
You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??
They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!
What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?
No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God.  Uh, just a dream.  OH MY GOD!!  GAAAH!! 
No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!
You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!
Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this.  AAAHH!
Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.
What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!
Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!  Oh Christ!  they might - could get me.
I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!
They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.
Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
We can do our report on the gnomes.
You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!
Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president , treasurer , and secretary  have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!
I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!
No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! 
GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?
Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!
Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!
They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!
Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 
They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!
Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!
I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!
They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!
...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!
Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.
The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants. 
Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.
Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! 
No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.
I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out!
