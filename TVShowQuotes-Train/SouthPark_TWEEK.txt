Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.

But we don't have hats!

The Ghost of Human Kindness?

Wait! I'll fight!

I'm not supposed to talk to you!

No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God.  Uh, just a dream.  OH MY GOD!!  GAAAH!! 

Oh God! Oh Jesus!

No! Don't do it!

NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!

Uunnnnhh!

It isn't?

You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!

You guys, we have a big problem!

They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!

Cartman likes to play with dolls?

O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!

They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!

Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!

Arrrr!

Hrrr!

I didn't mean to.

Dad!

Mine too!

Rrrr! What a jerk!

Oh man! This is too much pressure!

Goohoo!

He did?

Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.

Oh God. They're gonna get me.

Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this.  AAAHH!

Waagh!

I just have grounds.

What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!

Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!

But what if I put it in the wrong place?

Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme-  I can't remember uh-the code word!

Agh! God, change it!! 

What?

Conifer? Walking there would take hours!

Uh-uh huh.

Okay.

Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!

Gaaarh!

A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!

Fifty hats? Oh Jesus! 

Yes, just like hat!!

Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.

Maybe they wanna kill us.

Guh huh huh! 

Rrrr!

Arrrrh!

Gah! Me too.

Nrr. What happened?

Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!

Everyone in the world?! Rrrr! 

I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!

Your van? 

I'm not a chicken!

You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??

What?

I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!

You... guys wanted me to meet you here?

They're not better, they're just more expensive.

Rrrrh!

I guess so.

Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!

No

Well?

Oh God!  Change it! Change it! 

Arrh!  

Aarrgghh!

Jesus Christ, we killed her!

Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!

Except for Cartman - you can keep him.

Huh uh.

NOW what's happening?

Triben fak burushban.

That's my last pair of underpants! 

Hwaaah! 

Uurrgh!

Errh!

Rrr!

Aaaah! Oh God! 

You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!

Oh Jesus! Huh!

Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.

Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?

Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!

Why?

But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?

Guh!

Aaarrrnnn!

Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.

D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!

AaaaAAAHH! 

Aaaah!!

Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!

Mwaaah! Slavery?

Gaaaaah!

My center. My... center.  Calm  Cup? 

Oh man, you're a lucky guy.

I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!

What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!

Oh God.

AAH! Uh...

Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!  Oh Christ!  they might - could get me.

Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?

That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.

Get away from meee! 

Gahahghah

What do you want?

Then your premiere has no movie!

Gaarhrhrh!

Oh God! Oh Jesus!

Arrgghh! They took them again!

Waggh.

No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! 

Aahh!

Me neither.

Ah, I got rubber bands. 

I can't.  You do it.

Jesus Christ, she's dead!!

Aaarr! 

I'm not! I'm not a team player!

Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.

I don't have crooked teeth!

The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants. 

Oh, God. 

I don't know you!  Ah, AAAH!

But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.

Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!

Me too.

You don't?

There they are!

Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.

I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg! 

The gnomes!

Haaah!

Wagh!

Oh God! Huh!

Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!

I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.

We can do our report on the gnomes.

Oh God!

You did it!

Gnaaahahahah!  I pulled out my hair!

Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!

So? I don't know him!

You guys! Sshhhh! 

But we'll starve and die like dogs.

Uunh, it's too much pressure!

AAHH! This is it, man! It's over!

I'll... try.

Herr. What do you guys want?

Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!

Ow!

They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!

Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!

Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 

Hello!

Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!

Oh my God!

They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.

You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!! 

Huh? 

Oh my God they're gonna kill us. 

Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!

GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?

Uugh!

You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
