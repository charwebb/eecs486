Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!
They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!
No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!
Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!
I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!
But what if I put it in the wrong place?
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!
Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.
Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president , treasurer , and secretary  have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!
But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.
You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??
No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!
You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?
Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.
Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!
Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!
Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!
Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!
NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!
They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.
Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!  Oh Christ!  they might - could get me.
Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! 
The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants. 
Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??
You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme-  I can't remember uh-the code word!
No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!

Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!
I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!
Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!
Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! 
Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this.  AAAHH!
You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!!
