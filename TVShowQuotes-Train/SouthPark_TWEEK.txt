I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!! 
Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!
Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!  Oh Christ!  they might - could get me.
I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!
Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 
Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president , treasurer , and secretary  have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!
Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.
Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.
I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.
I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.
Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??
No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!
Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme-  I can't remember uh-the code word!
Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!
They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!
But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! 
Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!
...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!
Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!
No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God.  Uh, just a dream.  OH MY GOD!!  GAAAH!! 
But what if I put it in the wrong place?
No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! 
You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!
Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!
GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?
Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! 
What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?
Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this.  AAAHH!
You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
We can do our report on the gnomes.
But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.
You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??
No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!
They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!
Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!
I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
