What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
(preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.
(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.
(indicating) I've never seen a band like this.
(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
Well, I hope you send him a check.
I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But I'm not.
Oh, they don't care. We all do it.
They said they were sending an Asian woman.
Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.
You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.
What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
(Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.
You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?
(Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.
I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.
Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?
Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
(Leo has "Jerry" written on the fingers his right hand, and "Hello" written on his left. He's doing pull-ups) Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. (Turns to the right, yelling out) Answer that damn phone!
Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.
(Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
