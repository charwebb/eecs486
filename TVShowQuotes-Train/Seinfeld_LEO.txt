Give it to me.
(grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.
What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
You know where I just came from?
Jerry, hello! (Sits down)
(sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)
You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.
I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
I said it once.
(Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But I'm not.
Jerry, will you give me the bottle?
You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
Helloooo!
Oh, they don't care. We all do it.
How's your mom and dad?
You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
Yeah, I hate to give it up.
Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
Why didn't ya say hello?
(Leo has "Jerry" written on the fingers his right hand, and "Hello" written on his left. He's doing pull-ups) Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. (Turns to the right, yelling out) Answer that damn phone!
Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?
Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
Hello...
(Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
Leo.
Ha ha! How are you?
(defensive) One second...
Jerry, you ratted me out?!
They said they were sending an Asian woman.
He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
Nobody got a gun to your head!
Well, I hope you send him a check.
Hello!
What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!
(traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!
You have it on you?
(preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.
Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
Senior citizens. No big deal.
What fifty dollars?
(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
Jerry!
And you walked out without paying.
What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.
No more nuts. Awrghh.....
Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.
Yeah, me too.
The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'
(indicating) I've never seen a band like this.
I love these nuts.
You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
What're you doing here?
(grudgingly) She's awright.
(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.
Hello.
(Bitter) Jerry.
(Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.
You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.
(to Morty) Where's the bathroom?
I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
