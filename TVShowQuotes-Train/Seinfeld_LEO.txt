Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?
I said it once.
Nobody got a gun to your head!
Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
(Bitter) Jerry.
Why didn't ya say hello?
They give you some portion here, huh?
Hi, hi...
(indicating) I've never seen a band like this.
(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
Jerry, will you give me the bottle?
No more nuts. Awrghh.....
I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But I'm not.
Leo.
(preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.
Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.
Oh, they don't care. We all do it.
You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
Jerry!
Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.
(to Morty) Where's the bathroom?
And you walked out without paying.
What fifty dollars?
(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.
Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
(grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.
I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
Senior citizens. No big deal.
Jerry, you ratted me out?!
(sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)
You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
Ha ha! How are you?
You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.
I love these nuts.
I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
How's your mom and dad?
Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
Hello!
Hello.
Give it to me.
(Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
(Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
Well, I hope you send him a check.
Yeah, I hate to give it up.
What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
You have it on you?
The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'
(defensive) One second...
(Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.
You know where I just came from?
You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
What're you doing here?
Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
Jerry, hello! (Sits down)
What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!
Hello...
Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?
He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.
Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.
Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.
If anyone betrays me, I never forget.
Helloooo!
