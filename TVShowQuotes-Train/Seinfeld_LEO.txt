You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
(Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.
Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.
What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
(grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.
(to Morty) Where's the bathroom?
Yeah, I hate to give it up.
(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.
I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
They said they were sending an Asian woman.
You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
Give it to me.
You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
What're you doing here?
What fifty dollars?
Hi, hi...
Hello...
Ha ha! How are you?
Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.
Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
(sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)
If anyone betrays me, I never forget.
(grudgingly) She's awright.
Jerry!
Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
Jerry, hello! (Sits down)
Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?
(defensive) One second...
Leo.
Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.
I said it once.
I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'
Jerry, you ratted me out?!
(preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.
Yeah, me too.
Hello!
And you walked out without paying.
What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!
Helloooo!
Well, I hope you send him a check.
What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
How's your mom and dad?
You have it on you?
(indicating) I've never seen a band like this.
Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.
Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.
Senior citizens. No big deal.
Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.
(Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
(Bitter) Jerry.
Hello.
Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?
You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
Why didn't ya say hello?
(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
(Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
You know where I just came from?
Nobody got a gun to your head!
(traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!
I love these nuts.
They give you some portion here, huh?
