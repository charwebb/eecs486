What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
(grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.
What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
(grudgingly) She's awright.
Leo.
You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
(indicating) I've never seen a band like this.
Well, I hope you send him a check.
(preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.
Hello...
Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.
The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'
Jerry, will you give me the bottle?
Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?
Senior citizens. No big deal.
(traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!
Jerry, hello! (Sits down)
He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
Yeah, I hate to give it up.
Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.
How's your mom and dad?
Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
(sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)
Hi, hi...
(Leo has "Jerry" written on the fingers his right hand, and "Hello" written on his left. He's doing pull-ups) Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. (Turns to the right, yelling out) Answer that damn phone!
(defensive) One second...
What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!
Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.
Why didn't ya say hello?
(to Morty) Where's the bathroom?
Oh, they don't care. We all do it.
If anyone betrays me, I never forget.
I love these nuts.
(Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?
You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
Jerry!
Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.
(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.
Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.
Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.
And you walked out without paying.
What fifty dollars?
No more nuts. Awrghh.....
Ha ha! How are you?
Give it to me.
You know where I just came from?
(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
Nobody got a gun to your head!
Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
Hello.
Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
(Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
Helloooo!
Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
(Bitter) Jerry.
Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.
What're you doing here?
Yeah, me too.
I said it once.
You have it on you?
