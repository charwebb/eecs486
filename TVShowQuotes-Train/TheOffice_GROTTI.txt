But you also got a lot of responsibility
Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?
If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy.
Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?
Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give me a call?

God forbid you...  should have a fire in the warehouse.
Oh! Great. Michael, I'm finishing up your paperwork right now.
How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt! You always think, it can't happen to you, and [drops hand loudly on table] Think about it.
Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back.
As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride.
Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car?
Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you.
