This is one of those half booths, can't-decide-what-it-is type of thing.
I don't get it. How was I scaring you?
Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car?
Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?
Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there's injury.
Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give me a call?
Oh! Great. Michael, I'm finishing up your paperwork right now.
Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back.
God forbid you...  should have a fire in the warehouse.
Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion. [Andy clears throat loudly]  You okay, Pat?
None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss.
But you also got a lot of responsibility
As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride.
You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott.
I'm sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down.
How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt! You always think, it can't happen to you, and [drops hand loudly on table] Think about it.
Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you.
Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?
