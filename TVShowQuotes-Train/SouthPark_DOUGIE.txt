Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman.

Pehpew Pehpew! 

What do we do now?

Simpsons did it!

I like math.

What?

Neato.

So how do we build it?

Okay.

Hey Butters.

No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.

Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!

Do you think someday I can be a reporter?

Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!  We have to get out of here!

How should I know?

Come on, we have to leave!!

Oh, awesome!

...Like, you die.

What dastardly deed are we doing now?

Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! 

This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party.  As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us.  Anything else?

Oh, uh...

Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. 

Professor Chaos!

Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?

Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.

Hey, I'm a real reporter.

I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.

Simpsons did it!

Don't have a cow, man.

No.

...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.

Wow, you mean that?

Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!

Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! 

Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! 

Which Angel am I again?

Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!"

I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.

He's dead for sure.

Cheap XBox Ones? For real?

...Simpsons did it.

I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.

Air shaft.

What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?

Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?

I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!

Oh. 

I wanna be a reporter someday.

Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.

I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.

...Yeah.

Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.

Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!! 

You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.

See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
