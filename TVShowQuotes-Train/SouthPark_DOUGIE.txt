Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! 
You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.
I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!
Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.
You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.
They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!  We have to get out of here!
I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party.  As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us.  Anything else?
Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! 
I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.
Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.
See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.
Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!"
Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. 
I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.
Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?
No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.
What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?
Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?
...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.
