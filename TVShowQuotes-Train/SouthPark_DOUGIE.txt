Don't have a cow, man.

Air shaft.

I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.

How should I know?

He's dead for sure.

Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! 

Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. 

No.

Okay.

I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.

Neato.

...Yeah.

What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?

Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?

So how do we build it?

Pehpew Pehpew! 

Oh. 

You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.

Oh my God...

...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.

I like math.

I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.

This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party.  As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us.  Anything else?

What do we do now?

Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!

...Like, you die.

Simpsons did it!

Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.

Professor Chaos!

Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman.

I wanna be a reporter someday.

Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! 

I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!

Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!  We have to get out of here!

Cheap XBox Ones? For real?

Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!"

Come on, we have to leave!!

It's on all the way.

Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! 

No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.

They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.

Simpsons did it!

See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.

Do you think someday I can be a reporter?

Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.

Wow, you mean that?

What dastardly deed are we doing now?

Which Angel am I again?

What?

...Simpsons did it.

Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!

Oh, uh...

Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?

You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!

Hey, I'm a real reporter.

Oh, awesome!
