Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.
...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.
I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.
See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!
They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party.  As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us.  Anything else?
I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.
Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.
Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!  We have to get out of here!
Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!"
Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. 
Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?
Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman.
Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! 
Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?
You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.
What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?
Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! 
You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! 
Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.
