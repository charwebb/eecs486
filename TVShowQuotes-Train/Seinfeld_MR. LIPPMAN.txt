Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!
(What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?
What is this guy again?
I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.
It's out -
What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?
Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.
I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?
Well, you're really on your way now.
Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.
I want you out of here by the end of the day.
Mike Lubika?
What has he written?
To your promotion.
You're fired.
You want a muffin or not?
Uh, Ya, Have a seat.
Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaine's desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.
Name a couple.
Kramer. Come in.
An-Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didn't do any more of these shows.
How do you read?
Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?
The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh "Regis and Kathy Lee" the other day and -
What is going on here?
Art Vandelay?
Kramer, I'm sorry.
That's a good idea.
So what do we with the bottoms?
Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.
No. No. It is.
You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.
Ya, thank you.
If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?
So you just eat the tops.
Well I'm not bad. Not bad.
She did.
