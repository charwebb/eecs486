I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.
I want you out of here by the end of the day.
Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.
I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?
So you just eat the tops.
If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?
You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.
Kramer, I'm sorry.
Mike Lubika?
No, no, no. I mean authors.
So what do we with the bottoms?
It's out -
Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?
(What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?
Kramer. Come in.
You're fired.
The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh "Regis and Kathy Lee" the other day and -
You want a muffin or not?
No no, we just thought...
Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaine's desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.
To your promotion.
Name a couple.
An-Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didn't do any more of these shows.
Well I'm not bad. Not bad.
Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!
Well, you're really on your way now.
Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.
What has he written?
Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.
No. No. It is.
Kra-Kramer, I -
That's a good idea.
What is this guy again?
She did.
Art Vandelay?
What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?
Ya, thank you.
