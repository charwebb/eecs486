Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.
Uh, Ya, Have a seat.
Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.
Ya, thank you.
Kramer. Come in.
What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?
(What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?
I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.
Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaine's desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.
That's a good idea.
How do you read?
Kramer, I'm sorry.
Kra-Kramer, I -
Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!
What is this guy again?
Well, you're really on your way now.

Mike Lubika?
You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.
What is going on here?
I want you out of here by the end of the day.
You want a muffin or not?
So you just eat the tops.
To your promotion.
Art Vandelay?
I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.
Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?
No, no, no. I mean authors.
You're fired.
The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh "Regis and Kathy Lee" the other day and -
If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?
She did.
So what do we with the bottoms?
