So what do we with the bottoms?
The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh "Regis and Kathy Lee" the other day and -
What has he written?
Uh, Ya, Have a seat.
(What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?
Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.
It's out -
How do you read?
I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.
You want a muffin or not?
That's a good idea.
Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaine's desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.
An-Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didn't do any more of these shows.
Name a couple.
Well, you're really on your way now.
You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.
Kramer, I'm sorry.
Kramer. Come in.
Well I'm not bad. Not bad.
Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?
Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.
She did.
No no, we just thought...
No, no, no. I mean authors.
I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.
If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?
What is going on here?
What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?
No. No. It is.
You're fired.
Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!
Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.
Ya, thank you.
To your promotion.
What is this guy again?
Art Vandelay?
So you just eat the tops.
