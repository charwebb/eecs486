Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?
Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately.
Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million.
All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school.
Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?
This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?
After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages.
You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat.
All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty.
Half his stuff, 2 million from the school.
Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school.
You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million.
Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed! 
Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!
