You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat.
This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?
Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed! 
Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?
Half his stuff, 2 million from the school.
You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million.
Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!
Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million.
After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages.
All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty.
Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?
This is Case No. 47g, Everyone vs. Everyone.  Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski.
All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school.
Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately.
