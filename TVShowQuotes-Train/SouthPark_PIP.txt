Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. 

Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!

Ms. Havisham! But um...

But, if I say that, you'll hit me.

At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.

Gaagghh! 

What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?

Oh.

Thanks to you.

Eho. After you, miss.

Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day! 

Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.

Oh I... rather thought I was.

Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry! 

'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  Lunchy munchies, hmmm?

Don't you wanna play anymore?

Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.

Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?

Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah! 

Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?

Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.

Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--

Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't.

Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!

Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!

...I've come to answer the want ad.

I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?

Boyfriend??

Arrggghhh! 

Uh, Mr. Chef sir?

Oh, that's a splendid mission!

Good day, Damien. How are you?

Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?

Oh. Excuse me.

Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. 

Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me. 

Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.

Yes sir.

Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.

Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?

Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-

Oh, my goodness! 

Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?

Waaah!  Lovely day, isn't it?

Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.

None, sir.

And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.

Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.

...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.

You? But why?

Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.

What do you mean?

Righty-o. What are we going to play?

Right-o.

Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.

Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?

Yes, but... where will I find her?

Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation.

But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.

You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.

Did I do a nice job? Really?

Aaah! 

It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.

We did it! Great job, Angels!

Please, hit me.

Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.

Good-bye, sir.

Oh, what jolly good fun!

Twenty-six baby bunnies

I think you do.

Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. 

Eho!

Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.

Yes. I see.  Hoh, lovely.

Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. 

I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.

There! You see?! You do have a heart!

Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?

Where did everybody go?

Oho. Well, yes, miss.

Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.

Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?

Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar

Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid. 

Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?

Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies!

Uh, Mr. Chef sir?

Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.

This is a sad day for men everywhere.

Because I believe I'm in love with you.

That's a lot of  money-loney.

Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--

Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- 

Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.

Well, I still don't have a helmet.

Piiink eye!

Good evening, Ms. Havisham. 

Terribly sorry, Pocket.

You won't get away with this!

Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.

Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.

Well-uh I, I guess you win.

I'm not French--

Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?

Aaaa!  Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee! 

But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.

What??

I think that's got it.

Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.

Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land!

Now what do we do?

Bosley! Bosley!

Ooowww!

Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!

Well.  Alrighty then.

Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?

Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.

I won!

Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.

Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.

Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. 

Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff. 

Hey, look at this!

I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire. 

Oh, dear.

It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.

They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.

Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.  And besides, I hate French people. 

Um. 

Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.

But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.

So Bosley, what's our next mission?

Well, what do you mean?

Well, uh... I think she's very pretty.

I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!

Righto.

Righto. 

Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.

You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!

Gagghh! 

My, how lovely.

There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.

I think she's rather insulting.

I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.

I'm Pip, sir.

Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongueâ€¦

No um, I guess not.

Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.

If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!

Sorry! Sorry!

Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.

Oh dear.

Joe, do you know anything about girls?

We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?

Joe?

'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!

Who...? Who is that?

But why do you make your daughter hurt people?

Mr. Pocket?

No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! 

Oh, that's a wonderful idea.

Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first? 

Where?

But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.

I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.

Oh. I do believe I found it first.

It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.

Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.

I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There you are.  And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! 

Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?

What?
