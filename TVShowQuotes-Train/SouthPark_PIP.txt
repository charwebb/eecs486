Because I believe I'm in love with you.

Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.

It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.

I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, "Turrah!" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.

You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.

Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me. 

Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?

Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. 

This is a sad day for men everywhere.

I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?

Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.

Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah! 

Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?

Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. 

I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.

Oh. I do believe I found it first.

'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  Lunchy munchies, hmmm?

Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.

Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.

You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!

Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?

Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.

Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- 

It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.

Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!

Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.

But why do you make your daughter hurt people?

No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! 

...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.

But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.

Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.

And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.

Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.

Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?

Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.

I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!

I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.

Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.

Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land!

Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.

Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!

But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.

Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?

Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.

Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--

Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff. 

Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. 

What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?

Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.

Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.

Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies!

At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.

There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.

Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?

Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?

Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--

Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?

If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!

Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.

'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!

Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-

Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.

Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.  And besides, I hate French people. 

Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?

They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.

Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.

Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.

Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar

Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?

Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. 

Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?

Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.

There! You see?! You do have a heart!

Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.

Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.

But, if I say that, you'll hit me.

Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.

Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first? 

But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.

Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?

Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?
