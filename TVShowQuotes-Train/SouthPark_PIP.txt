But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?
Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!
Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.
Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?
Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.
Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. 
Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.
Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?
Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.
Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.
Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
But, if I say that, you'll hit me.
Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-
I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.
'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!
There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.
They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.
Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.  And besides, I hate French people. 
Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?
Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.
Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. 
I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.
Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day! 
I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There you are.  And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! 
Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.
Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?
Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.
But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.
Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first? 
Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?
Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me. 
You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.
Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongueâ€¦
But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.
Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, "Turrah!" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.
We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- 
Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies!
Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. 
It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.
But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.
Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.
Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.
Oh. I do believe I found it first.
Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land!
'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  Lunchy munchies, hmmm?
I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?
Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!
Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.
I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.
Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah! 
Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.
At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.
Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.
Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!
It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.
Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.
Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?
But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?
Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff. 
There! You see?! You do have a heart!
Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.
Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?
Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?
Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid. 
Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?
Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?
You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!
No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! 
If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!
What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?
Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.
Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--
Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.
