Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--
Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?
It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.
There! You see?! You do have a heart!
Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongueâ€¦
Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land!
Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid. 
And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day! 
What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?
Oh. I do believe I found it first.
Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me. 
Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.
I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.
There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.
I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There you are.  And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! 
Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?
Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.
I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.
Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.
Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.
Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.
Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.
Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.
Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies!
Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. 
But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.
Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.
Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?
Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.
Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. 
Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?
Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?
But, if I say that, you'll hit me.
Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.
Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first? 
Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.
I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, "Turrah!" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.
Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?
Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.
...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.
If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!
Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.
It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.
Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff. 
But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?
Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.
I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?
But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.
Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.
At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.
Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.
You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.
We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!
Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!
'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  Lunchy munchies, hmmm?
I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.
Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- 
Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. 
You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!
This is a sad day for men everywhere.
Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?
No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! 
Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.  And besides, I hate French people. 
Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?
Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-
Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?
Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?
Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.
Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.
Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.
