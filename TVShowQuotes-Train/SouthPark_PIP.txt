Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?

'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  Lunchy munchies, hmmm?

Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?

Oh. I do believe I found it first.

And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.

Waaah!  Lovely day, isn't it?

Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.

Oh. Excuse me.

Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.

Um. 

Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?

Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. 

Well.  Alrighty then.

Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. 

No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! 

Hello, Estella.

Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me. 

Oh, dear.

Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.

Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.

Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.

What??

Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongueâ€¦

But, if I say that, you'll hit me.

Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.

Well, I still don't have a helmet.

Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!

What?

Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah! 

Gaagghh! 

Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. 

Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?

But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.

Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!

They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.

There! You see?! You do have a heart!

Where did everybody go?

Oh, that's a splendid mission!

What do you mean?

Mr. Pocket?

Righto. 

Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I? 

...I've come to answer the want ad.

What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?

Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.

Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?

I'm Pip, sir.

Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.

Gagghh! 

Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?

Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!

Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.  And besides, I hate French people. 

Boyfriend??

Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!

Well, what do you mean?

Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. 

Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.

Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!

Because I believe I'm in love with you.

I think she's rather insulting.

We did it! Great job, Angels!

Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.

There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.

Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.

Aaah! 

It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.

Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.

Well, uh... I think she's very pretty.

Oh, dear.

Please, hit me.

Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?

I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?

Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.

I think you do.

That's a lot of  money-loney.

Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. 

Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--

You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!

Oh, that's a wonderful idea.

Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid. 

Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?

Aaaa!  Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee! 

Well-uh I, I guess you win.

Ms. Havisham! But um...

Now what do we do?

Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.

Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.

I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.

Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- 

Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.

Good evening, Ms. Havisham. 

Eho!

Did I do a nice job? Really?

Who is that?

Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry! 

Ooowww!

You won't get away with this!

You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.

Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?

Hey, look at this!

Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land!

Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-

Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation.

Oh dear.

Sorry! Sorry!

'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!

Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar

Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first? 

Oh, my goodness! 

Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?

O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day! 

Righty-o. What are we going to play?

Oho. Well, yes, miss.

Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff. 

Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?

Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.

It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.

Bosley! Bosley!

Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.

I'd love to!

Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.

Yes, but... where will I find her?

Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--

I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire. 

No um, I guess not.

Oh, what jolly good fun!

Arrggghhh! 

Joe?

But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.

But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.

But why do you make your daughter hurt people?

Oh! Oh I think I found one! 

Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.

Uh, Mr. Chef sir?

Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.

I think that's got it.

Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.

If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!

Eho. After you, miss.

Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.

But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.

I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.

Righto.

Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?

Aaaaaaaargh!

I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.

Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.

Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?

Where?

Joe, do you know anything about girls?

I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, "Turrah!" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.

Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't.

...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.

It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.

Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.

Terribly sorry, Pocket.

Yes sir.

Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day! 

Right-o.

So Bosley, what's our next mission?

Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?

Who...? Who is that?

Thanks to you.

This is a sad day for men everywhere.

Piiink eye!

Oh, bother.

Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.

Yes. I see.  Hoh, lovely.

Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies!

At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.

We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
