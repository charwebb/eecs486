Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.
What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?
...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.
Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. 
Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.
Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.
Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!
No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! 
Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--
Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. 
Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!
Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.
Oh. I do believe I found it first.
Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-
Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. 
Because I believe I'm in love with you.
I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.
Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?
Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?
It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.
Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah! 
This is a sad day for men everywhere.
Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?
Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff. 
Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!
Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?
They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.
'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!
But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.
Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land!
Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first? 
But, if I say that, you'll hit me.
Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.
Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.
But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.
Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. 
Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.
Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  Lunchy munchies, hmmm?
Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?
I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?
But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.
Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?
Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, "Turrah!" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.
And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.
Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.  And besides, I hate French people. 
Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?
You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!
At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.
Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.
Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.
Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.
Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me. 
Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?
Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies!
Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?
Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.
But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.
Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongueâ€¦
I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There you are.  And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! 
Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.
Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- 
There! You see?! You do have a heart!
Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.
We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.
It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.
Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid. 
Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?
Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.
Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day! 
Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.
