(Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)
(looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)
(taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?!
In my mind, there's a war still going on.
That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?
I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand)
We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
Except, we gotta do something about the name.
What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)
You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
No, I brought it in. They never put it out.
This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
A woman? What are you out of your mind?
What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?"!!
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.
So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?
(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)
(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?
(shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
(to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!!
Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.
Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!
It's like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm.
No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
(yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.
(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
(shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!
Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.
What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...
George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)
(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.
Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand)
(To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.
Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.
(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.
Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this.
The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!
(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
(disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.
George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
(Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here!
You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?
(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.
(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
Why do you need all that ketchup for?
Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.
I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.
Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...
Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!
(from other room) I never seen people treated like this!
I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.
(Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would)
Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
(shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
(examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?
He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
I had an affair with a Korean woman.
(leaving the kitchen) It's creative black tie. Move, woman.
I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.
Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
(anger) But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!
Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her!
(anger) Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?" (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.
(Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)
(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
(Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.
Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!
It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short.
(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.
What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
I don't think you did such a good job on these...
There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.
Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.
Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.
(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat?
Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!
Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)
Didn't I give you my old record player?
Get the hell out of here. He's getting married?
Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?
The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"
Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?
Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenners here, George is dead, call me back!
It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!
No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
Who put you up to this, was it her?
Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)
Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
You don't even know what they're made from.
My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.
Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!
Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.
They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, " eno enoa juang ". Which means, "this guy - this is not my kind of guy".
And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?
Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!
(anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead)
You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.
You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.
...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I don't need it now...
I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles)
Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!
Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
(on TV) You step on it and it flushes.
I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?
(hanging up) Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.
I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back
How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.
What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?
No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.
No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.
(angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!
How hard could it be to kill this thing?
That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!
You can look for sneakers the next day!
So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
(grabbing the card) Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?
No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!
And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?
Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.
You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.
Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
You sayin' you want a piece of me?
Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
