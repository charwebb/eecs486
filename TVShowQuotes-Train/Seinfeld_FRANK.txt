What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.
(shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.
(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!
Except, we gotta do something about the name.
(hanging up) Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.
Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.
Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.
Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.
Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
(anger) Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
(Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)
You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand)
(yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.
You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? (doorbell rings) Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?
Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.
What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)
This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
No, I brought it in. They never put it out.
Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.
George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
Will you put her to rest for me?
Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
(disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?
No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.
(from other room) I never seen people treated like this!
You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.
We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.
Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
(angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!
You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!
How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.
Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"
I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short.
That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
(anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, " eno enoa juang ". Which means, "this guy - this is not my kind of guy".
He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.
(shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!
(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.
No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.
I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand)
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!
What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!
I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!
They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her!
(Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)
Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)
You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.
(Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)
A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.
You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.
(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.
Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
(to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!!
Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.
I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles)
I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
It's like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm.
Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
(taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?!
Okay, THAT'S IT! "oki on awa" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.
Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!
Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!
(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
Didn't I give you my old record player?
You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!
No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!
Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!
Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!
How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
You sayin' you want a piece of me?
It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.
Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)
(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?
Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?
Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.
Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
(Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here!
(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?
(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.
(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
(shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
Your arm moves like this? (does the nudging motion)
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenners here, George is dead, call me back!
I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.
Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
You can look for sneakers the next day!
How hard could it be to kill this thing?
Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
Get the hell out of here. He's getting married?
(jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!
(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.
Who put you up to this, was it her?
I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
(Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this.
What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back
(To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat?
(putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt.
(Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would)
If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!
C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.
(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?
Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.
And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
(examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?
Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.
Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...
I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.
That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?
The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!
George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?
In my mind, there's a war still going on.
My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
I had an affair with a Korean woman.
(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...
(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)
Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead)
How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.
No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
(Drawing a zero under George's name) This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.
...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I don't need it now...
Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?
Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
(grabbing the card) Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?
(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.
Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?
(Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?" (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.
Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?
(anger) But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!
And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
Why do you need all that ketchup for?
(on TV) You step on it and it flushes.
You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
(looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.
Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
You don't even know what they're made from.
