(disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)
Your arm moves like this? (does the nudging motion)
I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her!
It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?
(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat?
Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back
(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)
(shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.
(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!
Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!
Okay, THAT'S IT! "oki on awa" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.
Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
You sayin' you want a piece of me?
Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
How hard could it be to kill this thing?
Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.
Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
(anger) Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.
I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?" (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.
You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.
Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)
(putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt.
The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!
...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I don't need it now...
George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?
What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?
No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
(jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!
Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
(on TV) You step on it and it flushes.
(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.
(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!
Will you put her to rest for me?
Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...
Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
A woman? What are you out of your mind?
Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand)
What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?
Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.
You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?
(leaving the kitchen) It's creative black tie. Move, woman.
Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this.
What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.
Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
(Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
(anger) But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!
Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
Except, we gotta do something about the name.
Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?
(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.
No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.
And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)
Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!
My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
(shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!
Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.
(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?
Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)
(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.
Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.
I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.
(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.
I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.
You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.
(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.
(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenners here, George is dead, call me back!
(Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)
George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.
Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.
They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.
You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!
You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.
I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?
Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!
George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?
I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.
(Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)
I had an affair with a Korean woman.
I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
In my mind, there's a war still going on.
He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
(Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
Didn't I give you my old record player?
I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.
(angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.
(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand)
The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
You can look for sneakers the next day!
Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
(anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.
Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.
I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles)
(Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would)
Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.
It's like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm.
(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
(taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?!
You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.
(examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?
Get the hell out of here. He's getting married?
No, I brought it in. They never put it out.
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.
Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
You don't even know what they're made from.
You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.
I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
(yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!
Who put you up to this, was it her?
(Drawing a zero under George's name) This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.
Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.
Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!
(from other room) I never seen people treated like this!
(shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead)
He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!
Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
(To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!
What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short.
What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?"!!
Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?
(Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here!
Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!
How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? (doorbell rings) Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?
(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!
I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.
Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)
Why do you need all that ketchup for?
No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!
How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.
So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
