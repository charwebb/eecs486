Serenity now!
I'd know him anywhere.
With whom?
You still need a cook?
In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short.
So far.
We'll go out for dinner tonight.
How did you know?
It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
Why'd you take my TV Guide?
(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
We still haven't finished the first game.
I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?
Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
You like to gamble, Cosmo?
I don't think you did such a good job on these...
We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
All right! All right!
What was that?
You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?
(shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.
(hanging up) Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.
How hard could it be to kill this thing?
Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.
That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back
George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
(putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt.
I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
Take a look.
In my mind, there's a war still going on.
Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead)
Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!
They're not coming?
So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
Assman? I'll get him, Assman!
If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!
Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
Where am I supposed to sleep?
He was my lawyer.
You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand)
We're having an upscale dinner.
Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
Queens is full of mosquitoes.
Manssierre!
How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.
No, I brought it in. They never put it out.
Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
(Drawing a zero under George's name) This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.
That's another one of my shirts!!
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!!
(Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would)
It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
How 'bout uh... the mansiere?
You were the one who smothered him.
(shouting) You have no eye for fashion!!!
(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.
Who put you up to this, was it her?
How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
Not really.
(Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
Yes?
Tired.
(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
What, they brainwashed you?
I don't know what you mean.
Who is this?
Okay, where's my boy?
I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
I had to make a living!
We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
No, bro's no good. Too ethnic.
I didn't read his resume.
And stay away from those squirrels.
(looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
Well... thank you very much!
She's not pretty?
That's perverse.
(Taking off his sweater) Let's rumble!
Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.
(from other room) I never seen people treated like this!
(Yelling) That's not a booth!
(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
(to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!!
What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
Okay...
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.
I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)
Where's your friend Kramer?
You can look for sneakers the next day!
Definitely velcro.
(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
Who's this Rudy?
What is this thing anyway?
Also internal problems.
Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?
I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.
Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
Well, we got to get moving.
How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
Blow out the candles!!
I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.
Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
Five dollars a game, huh?
I'm sure she's pretty gorgeous.
You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.
Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!"
How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?
You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
(Complaining) I can't make anything..
Why should they go to waste?!?
It's like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm.
Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.
Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!
I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand)
Get the hell out of here. He's getting married?
Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
We call it.. the, uh..
I had an affair with a Korean woman.
It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
You don't even know what they're made from.
...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I don't need it now...
The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.
(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
I like mansiere.
Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
Or, the mansiere.
Yeah. I'll take some.
Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!
(Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)
You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.
It's Carlo. I found him!
Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
(Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)
I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles)
They didn't say hello?
You never mentioned them to me!
You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!
Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, " eno enoa juang ". Which means, "this guy - this is not my kind of guy".
You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?
Can I talk to her, please?
Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.
You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
I will not tolerate infestation.
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
Get outta here! We have a booth.
Who's Rudy? What clothes?
What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
Where the hell is my paper?
Here, Cosmo...
And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
I fell on some Fusilli.
You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.
That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
We're cuttin' you lose.
We have a catered affair.
(anger) But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!
Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.
Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?
George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)
What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.
That's right. That's me on the left.
What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
Follow through? What do you mean?
Serenity nowww!
(Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
You come here.
I got things to do, too.
Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!
I feel ten years younger.
(yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
And it was safe.
Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
Didn't I give you my old record player?
Yeah. So what?
We'll work something out.
Maybe?
Why not?
A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?
Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.
My clothes don't have moths!
Youve been in there an hour.
Huh?
There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.
It's a Coupe de Elegance.
Okay, THAT'S IT! "oki on awa" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.
This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
Yeah.
Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.
Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.
He's not family. It's different, psychologically.
How'd you get yours?
You were having sex on our bed?!
(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.
Like you wouldn't believe.
And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.
I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!
(to Kramer) That's what we figured, huh?
What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
Do you think you can handle it?
Why do you need all that ketchup for?
I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?"!!
Well it sucks.
How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)
Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.
Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
No! Follow me.
It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"
You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.
I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
It's him! (Standing up) It's Carlo Costanza!
Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.
Where's the powdered sugar?
Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!
It's cruise wear!
What is that, like a little chicken?
Moths, ate three boxes?
Manssierre! You...!
(shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!
(angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!
The Maestro? What Maestro?
Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...
(anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
You sayin' you want a piece of me?
Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.
I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
She was.
They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.
Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?
George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
No it isn't!
2 o'clock.
(disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
It's dry.
Kim?
What d'you mean, busy?
Let me see it.
A woman? What are you out of your mind?
You want me to wear a bra?!
(looks up to heaven) She's deceased.
Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
Eight ball.
Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!
Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!
Kasha?
What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her!
Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
Where's the mail?
Elaine took it?
Order a hot dish.
Costanza, you're white hot!
What stain?
Ya got T-Fal?
Okay.
Hey! Lloyd!
And I can breathe easier, too.
Aah!!!
I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
She'd never make it.
(on TV) You step on it and it flushes.
Gamebird?
What's that?
What the hell does that mean?
(To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!
Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
Except, we gotta do something about the name.
That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?
They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
(indicating a chair) Put it over there.
This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.
The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!
George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?
(taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?!
How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? (doorbell rings) Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?
So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
It's a slap in the face.
Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.
Serenity now!
Will you put her to rest for me?
(anger) Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.
He's gonna see it.
Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)
So, what am I supposed to say?
Let me see it.
Thank you.
No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?
Your mother recommended him.
(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat?
Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?
(Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here!
First Kramer, then Elaine?
You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.
Will you stop it?
Thank you, Kramer.
Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.
But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
Stop crying, and fight your father!
To a woman?
You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!
Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)
Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?
I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!
Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?" (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.
I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.
George! George!
What?
We had some good times.
(shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
Let's do it!
This is the best Festivus ever!
...I got one at home.
No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!
(examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?
Under arrest? What for?
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenners here, George is dead, call me back!
This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this.
(jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!
Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.
So, we're blowing it all.
(Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this.
(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.
