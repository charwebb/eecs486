Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
(Looks up) Where's that breeze coming from?
It's cruise wear!
(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!
Assman? I'll get him, Assman!
(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)
Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.
This feels very comfortable.
Who is this?
(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!
But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...
It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
I don't think you did such a good job on these...
Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?
Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.
(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?
You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
Yeah. I'll take some.
It's like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm.
He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
(Yelling) That's not a booth!
(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?
Okay.
To a woman?
Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
Will you stop it?
(Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)
Follow through? What do you mean?
You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
(hanging up) Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.
And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
I'm the father.
Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
(indicating a chair) Put it over there.
(Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this.
Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand)
I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.
No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.
Manssierre!
George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.
Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
Youve been in there an hour.
You want me to wear a bra?!
Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!
I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
(disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
I don't know what you mean.
Why'd you take my TV Guide?
I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!
Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
Stop crying, and fight your father!
Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this.
What is that, like a little chicken?
Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
Didn't I give you my old record player?
You were having sex on our bed?!
Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, " eno enoa juang ". Which means, "this guy - this is not my kind of guy".
Have you seen the pole, Kruger?
(Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
Order a hot dish.
My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.
We call it.. the, uh..
I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand)
(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)
It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.
Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.
I like mansiere.
She was.
(Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
He's gonna see it.
What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.
I feel ten years younger.
Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
(on TV) You step on it and it flushes.
No it isn't!
Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
Eight ball.
(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
George, open the door.
What d'you mean, busy?
All right! All right!
Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)
I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.
His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
2 o'clock.
With whom?
And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
The Maestro? What Maestro?
Well it sucks.
You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
That's another one of my shirts!!
I had an affair with a Korean woman.
Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?
Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!"
I'd know him anywhere.
Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.
He said I was dead?
My clothes don't have moths!
I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I don't need it now...
Under arrest? What for?
Why do you need all that ketchup for?
That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?
They're not coming?
Your mother recommended him.
You never mentioned them to me!
This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
Thank you.
(to Kramer) That's what we figured, huh?
Hey! Lloyd!
(shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
She's not pretty?
The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
Let's begin.
What was that?
(anger) Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
Hello, woman. (leaves)
No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!
Will you put her to rest for me?
Why not?
How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
You like to gamble, Cosmo?
Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?
He was my lawyer.
Serenity nowww!
Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
(shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
Let me see it.
Blow out the candles!!
We have a catered affair.
Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
How did you know?
I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
(angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!
Kim?
Kasha?
You don't even know what they're made from.
Your arm moves like this? (does the nudging motion)
Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?
This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
Who's Rudy? What clothes?
We still haven't finished the first game.
Who's this Rudy?
Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.
Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
Okay...
Huh?
How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
So, we're blowing it all.
Manssierre! You...!
Tired.
How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.
In my mind, there's a war still going on.
You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.
(Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here!
Thank you, Kramer.
Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)
We're cuttin' you lose.
Costanza, you're white hot!
Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.
Where am I supposed to sleep?
I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
No, I brought it in. They never put it out.
Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.
I'm sure she's pretty gorgeous.
(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.
I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.
(looks up to heaven) She's deceased.
Where's the powdered sugar?
Who put you up to this, was it her?
(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
(grabbing the card) Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?
Well... thank you very much!
Gamebird?
I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
And stay away from those squirrels.
Okay, where's my boy?
Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
No! Follow me.
Yeah. So what?
Ya got T-Fal?
You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?
You sayin' you want a piece of me?
(examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?
It's a Coupe de Elegance.
(jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!
The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!
Here, Cosmo...
(Taking off his sweater) Let's rumble!
I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.
(shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!
So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.
You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!!
(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
I didn't read his resume.
What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?
Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
Five dollars a game, huh?
You still need a cook?
What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her!
Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)
That's perverse.
(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
Yeah.
That's it! You're grounded!
Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
I still say we're related.
You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.
Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.
A woman? What are you out of your mind?
Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
(Drawing a zero under George's name) This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.
Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
(looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
Not really.
Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
(To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!
(yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
So, what am I supposed to say?
Let me see it.
She'd never make it.
How 'bout uh... the mansiere?
Also internal problems.
I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
(to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!!
Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
It's him! (Standing up) It's Carlo Costanza!
(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat?
(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!
Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!
No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.
I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles)
Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.
(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
(Complaining) I can't make anything..
We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
They didn't say hello?
Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
It's a slap in the face.
What, they brainwashed you?
Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
I fell on some Fusilli.
I got things to do, too.
Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...
George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?
That's right. That's me on the left.
That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?
It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"
Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!
It's dry.
Let's do it!
No! You never said milky white!
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!
Serenity now!
You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
Yes?
I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?" (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.
What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?"!!
I had to make a living!
What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)
George! George!
No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.
Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
What stain?
Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
Well, we got to get moving.
So far.
You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.
C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.
Queens is full of mosquitoes.
(from other room) I never seen people treated like this!
How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? (doorbell rings) Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?
Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.
You were the one who smothered him.
What's that?
Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!
It's Carlo. I found him!
Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
We'll work something out.
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenners here, George is dead, call me back!
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
And I can breathe easier, too.
He's not family. It's different, psychologically.
Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
Moths, ate three boxes?
We'll go out for dinner tonight.
No, bro's no good. Too ethnic.
How'd you get yours?
(Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would)
Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!
It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
What the hell does that mean?
How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
You can look for sneakers the next day!
(taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?!
Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead)
We had some good times.
No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
Where's the mail?
Or, the mansiere.
Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
(anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
Get outta here! We have a booth.
Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?
What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?
(leaving the kitchen) It's creative black tie. Move, woman.
(anger) But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!
There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.
Aah!!!
Can I talk to her, please?
And it was safe.
Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!
They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
Elaine took it?
And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
They made a derogatory comment about me.
(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.
(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.
First Kramer, then Elaine?
Take a look.
Yeah, we worked it out.
Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
Definitely velcro.
Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.
(shouting) You have no eye for fashion!!!
What is this thing anyway?
...I got one at home.
I will not tolerate infestation.
