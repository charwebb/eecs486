(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
She was.
Also internal problems.
You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!
How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?
(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
Do you think you can handle it?
Yeah. I'll take some.
What, they brainwashed you?
This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.
Will you put her to rest for me?
(shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
Okay...
(shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.
I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.
Yes?
Queens is full of mosquitoes.
He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
That's right. That's me on the left.
(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
(shouting) You have no eye for fashion!!!
Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.
Serenity now!
What the hell does that mean?
Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)
Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!
(Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would)
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.
(Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
Well it sucks.
Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
(indicating a chair) Put it over there.
What is that, like a little chicken?
Manssierre! You...!
How'd you get yours?
Moths, ate three boxes?
(examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?
Didn't I give you my old record player?
I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)
Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.
Okay.
How did you know?
So, we're blowing it all.
How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? (doorbell rings) Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?
Okay, THAT'S IT! "oki on awa" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.
Elaine took it?
It's Carlo. I found him!
In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short.
Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
Who's Rudy? What clothes?
Assman? I'll get him, Assman!
(Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)
Where am I supposed to sleep?
A woman? What are you out of your mind?
You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!
What is this thing anyway?
I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
The man on the tape wasn't specific.
Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
We call it.. the, uh..
Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!"
I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
You're not kidding it's a good move!
(Looks up) Where's that breeze coming from?
Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...
Why not?
What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her!
Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?
Well... thank you very much!
I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.
Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?
What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?"!!
Who's this Rudy?
What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
With whom?
I didn't read his resume.
(disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenners here, George is dead, call me back!
Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.
(to Kramer) That's what we figured, huh?
We have a catered affair.
(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?
No, bro's no good. Too ethnic.
(on TV) You step on it and it flushes.
Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
In my mind, there's a war still going on.
I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
What?
I'm sure she's pretty gorgeous.
(to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!!
The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!
Why'd you take my TV Guide?
No, I brought it in. They never put it out.
Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?
Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
I fell on some Fusilli.
She's not pretty?
Kasha?
Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
(putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt.
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.
George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?
You were having sex on our bed?!
There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.
Where's your friend Kramer?
Your arm moves like this? (does the nudging motion)
You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.
You can look for sneakers the next day!
No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
So, what am I supposed to say?
(Taking off his sweater) Let's rumble!
Thank you.
No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.
George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back
George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
Order a hot dish.
(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.
I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.
I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles)
We'll work something out.
Blow out the candles!!
Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!
Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead)
And stay away from those squirrels.
Take a look.
This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.
He was my lawyer.
I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
And it was safe.
It's a Coupe de Elegance.
(Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here!
Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.
What stain?
What was that?
How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)
C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.
(Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)
That's another one of my shirts!!
Well, we got to get moving.
It's dry.
Except, we gotta do something about the name.
I'm the father.
You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
We'll go out for dinner tonight.
Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
So far.
Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)
It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
Read that poem.
I got things to do, too.
You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
I had to make a living!
Can I talk to her, please?
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.
Who is this?
Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...
Let's do it!
You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.
All right! All right!
If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!
So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!
Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
How 'bout uh... the mansiere?
(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this.
You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?
Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.
This feels very comfortable.
His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?
I don't think you did such a good job on these...
(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.
Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.
Where's the mail?
You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
(angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!
What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
It's cruise wear!
Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
(grabbing the card) Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?
(anger) But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!
No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!
It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"
It's him! (Standing up) It's Carlo Costanza!
To a woman?
Where's the powdered sugar?
Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!
What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
We're cuttin' you lose.
Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
Will you stop it?
(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
Gamebird?
(Yelling) That's not a booth!
My clothes don't have moths!
(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
George! George!
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
(Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this.
Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
Follow through? What do you mean?
He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.
This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
Get outta here! We have a booth.
We're having an upscale dinner.
Tired.
Thank you, Kramer.
(taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?!
Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
Get the hell out of here. He's getting married?
Ya got T-Fal?
(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I don't need it now...
Like you wouldn't believe.
Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.
They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.
(looks up to heaven) She's deceased.
(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat?
Serenity nowww!
Have you seen the pole, Kruger?
(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!
Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
(Drawing a zero under George's name) This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.
Why should they go to waste?!?
What d'you mean, busy?
Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
I like mansiere.
Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
(anger) Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
Serenity now!
I will not tolerate infestation.
It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
2 o'clock.
(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.
Where the hell is my paper?
That's perverse.
My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.
How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
Costanza, you're white hot!
(shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!
Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
No it isn't!
Under arrest? What for?
I had an affair with a Korean woman.
(from other room) I never seen people treated like this!
It's like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm.
Kim?
Youve been in there an hour.
No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
(Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
I'd know him anywhere.
Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
...I got one at home.
Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
Your mother recommended him.
We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
She'd never make it.
Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, " eno enoa juang ". Which means, "this guy - this is not my kind of guy".
Manssierre!
But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
They didn't say hello?
You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.
You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
Stop crying, and fight your father!
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
He said I was dead?
You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
He's gonna see it.
No! You never said milky white!
Eight ball.
(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)
That's it! You're grounded!
No! Follow me.
Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?
Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!
We still haven't finished the first game.
(jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!
(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!
No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
(To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
Yeah. So what?
I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.
That's your mother's new car.
And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
(leaving the kitchen) It's creative black tie. Move, woman.
You like to gamble, Cosmo?
(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
This is the best Festivus ever!
Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
Who put you up to this, was it her?
Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!
Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.
(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
You don't even know what they're made from.
Not really.
Here, Cosmo...
Let me see it.
And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.
Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)
They're not coming?
Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?
The Maestro? What Maestro?
What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?
Huh?
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!
He's not family. It's different, psychologically.
(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!
Maybe?
It's a slap in the face.
I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
Why do you need all that ketchup for?
First Kramer, then Elaine?
Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!!
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.
You never mentioned them to me!
What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!
Let me see it.
You come here.
Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand)
What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.
Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
George, open the door.
I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
Or, the mansiere.
(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?
Aah!!!
(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.
Yeah.
Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?
Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
I don't know what you mean.
Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.
Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.
Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.
