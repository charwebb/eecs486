Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!
Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. As well as he should be, as I will now jam my thumb up his butthole.
Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching.
As we steer our boat down , looking for these dangerous predators... Boy, there's a king croc right here.  He must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long at least.  This croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off.
No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake.  This is the most poisonous snake in this entire region.  Now, what I'm gonna do, is carefully sneak up on him, and jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey!  Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now!  Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right!
Now for the coup de gras. I'll just... get my... thumb up... here.
I'm gonna jam my thumb it its butthole now! This should really piss it off!  Oh, yeah, that pissed it off, all right!  I've gotta be careful!
If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole.  Oh, boy, it's pissed off now.
Wait a second.  I think he came through here recently.
This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.
