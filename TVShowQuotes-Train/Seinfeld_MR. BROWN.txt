Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.
We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.
I'm sorry, Michael. We're actually out of time.
Stop it!
Oh right, more like 200 years.
Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.
Does anyone have anything else at all? Anyone besides Michael?
Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?
Don't worry about dating.
Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...
Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
HERO, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Um...
Great. We're all set.
Does this company have 100 years to erase?
I can't leave until you do.
Beautiful.
Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.
Oh, nice.
Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
Great.
Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
No, no, no, no. An outsider's perspective would probably be pretty helpful.
No. With more ignorance.
Mr. Brown.
So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.
Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.
Well, we only have an hour.
Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.
Okay, Michael, I just...
Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.
That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.
Michael, can I talk to you candidly?
OK. Thank you.
Yeah, but it's not appropriate. This is not helpful as a memory aid.
Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
Oh, my sorry. That is not appropriate.
Right. OK.
Wait a second.
Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.
OK.
Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.
Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.
