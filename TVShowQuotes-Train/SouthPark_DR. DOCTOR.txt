Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!

Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine.

Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left.

Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in.

Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist. 

It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.

There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!

Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.  Oops, he's hemorrhaging. 

He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.  Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?

There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see. 

I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital.

Yes, it was pretty severe.

Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life!  Get a cold towel on that pink belly!

Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck.

I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma.

Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT. And get something for the kid, too.

Yes?

Oh, yes. Where is Stan?

Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something. 

Good. Head towards it. Team A out.

Can I talk to you outside?

Well, what food have you been eating?

No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment.

Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated. 

Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry.

We just got the X-rays back.  He mostly got served here  and here . But the worst serving was here in the pelvis region. The road to recovery will be a long one.

The what?

...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?

It's a stick.

Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?

One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat! 

Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die.

We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.

Hold on, hold people people, please!  We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!

Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal.

We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.

My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.

We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.

Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery.  If you'll just sign this release. 

Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach.

No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep. 

Well, this is about all I can do for him.

Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die.

I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle.

Suction! 

Ooo! His head fell off.

This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours. 

Of course. Nurse? 

And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us. 

This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.

Let's not validate his delusions.

Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?

Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer.

It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now.

No, it isn't strep...

Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release.

We believe that you might have a problem.

We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure.

Give the child to me. 

He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo.

Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?

She'll be fine.

Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!  Oh, sorry.

He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.

Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!

Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.

Mr. and Ms. McCormick.

I'm afraid he's... running out of time.

Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly.

Do you know anything about surgery?

For what?

My God, that's a hell of a storm. 

Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed.

There there now, it's not your fault.

Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs.

Roger, Team B.  He's reached the backup generator.  Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?

Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage.

There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of. 

I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do.

Yes, fat camp.

Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-

Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days. 

It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy.

It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.

Nurse, I could use some help in here!

Look! He's coming around again.

Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.

It's his time. It's ...running out.

Quickly! Get the scanner running again!  We've got a chance now!

We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show.

He got served. Worst I've ever seen.

He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine.

Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.

You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time.

He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.

That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact,  there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle.

Alright, send him in.  Oh, Stanley.

What?

Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank.

Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--

I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn.

Sorry, son, it might be a while.

How can I help you?

Give the poor kid some morphine. 

Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me.  Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms.  Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?

You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes.

Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition.

I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter.

It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.  I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side. 

What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives.

We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly. 

It's ali- 

From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride.

He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while.

We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son. 

Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart.

Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied.

Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?

Why, hello there, Eric. 

You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick.  It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life. 

Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma.

Your prescription for what?

Yep, you check out fine.

He needs to have more time.

It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?

We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.

Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.

No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands.

We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny.  Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.  Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here  where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here.  Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?

I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored.

No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed. 

Oh, hello Coach.

Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays.

I'm going to prescribe a laxative.  But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful.

Jesus Christ.  What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup.

I can see its head!
