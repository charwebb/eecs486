Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
Yeah, you should.
To look good for Val!
Hey Michael. This ain't over.
There's other pencil's in this office.
Give me your job.
Really? That is messed up man.
Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
That bothers me too.
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Is she sick? How are her poops?
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
Shh! Movie's almost over.
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
She's trying.
Guess I���m going upstairs.
Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim���s company.
I loved it.
And the game's over seconds later.
Yeah.
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
Stairs. Oh, man....
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
Again, never agreed upon.
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
What's it say?
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
It's ok.
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
$30.00
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
Loyalty.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Andy, who punched you?
One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
What have you done for me?
Processed.
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
Oh, I never sing with soul.
Yo.
Oh?
Eat. It.
It's like Driving Miss Daisy, you know?
There you go.
It can.
It���s not pizza.
Yeah, that���s crazy.
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
Dracula.
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
That's crazy money. I'll take forty.
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
Right in here?
It's so strong.
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
[clears throat] Notice anything different about me?
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Huh?
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
Thank you.
Are you with us Mike?
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
You want to dance?
Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
Exactly like this.
Oh, oh, I���m sure we did.
Cool.
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
Dude.
No.
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
Why is the forklift in the wall?
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
All right, this is just messed up.
It's cool really.
I can't--- what, Mike?  Are you---
Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.
[speaking Spanish] Por favor, tequila seoor.
What?! Really?
How would you like it if we booed you?
Are you kidding? You wait.
19, serving 4. [serves and scores]
Cool.
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
Curl up with your favorite DVD.
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
Yes.
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
Happy hour. My pleasure.
Snap, for real?
Condoms.
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
I got it. I'm doin' it.
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
Whoa! Hold on.
Why can't I just... tell you?
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
Like what?
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
How do I do that?
Da  na na na na .
I know, I know. It's just hard.
No.
Da  na na na na.
Back off! I got my reasons.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
You popped one kernel.
If you loan me some money.
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
I'll put you down for shortbreads.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Mike you'll drive this every weekend?
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
Yep. Take care.
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
Nice scatting, man.
[clears throat]
Still no plan.
Thanks T-Man, later.  [fist bumps Toby}
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
That was cold.
Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
Hello, hello.
Please...
Action!
Make it happen, cap'in.
You need to get back on top.
You know, get it right.
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
Yeah.
You could be.
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Uh weight lifting yeah.
All right, what's up Mike?
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
Yeah.
Hope it's all right.
I believe I want to go home.
I would.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
[laughs] That's a text. [high fives Andy]
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
Just getting a tea bag.
She's six.
Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
I'll take him.
Tacos.
Yeah.
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
What?
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
Sounds all right.
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
Is that grease on my floor?
What up?
Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
Da  na na na na.
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
Please call me back.
Block, block, block!
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
I'm good.
You ready for me?
[on phone] This is Darryl.
Oh, hey.
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
I thought that was your job.
Something full of acid.
Thanks, man.
Perfect.
Oh yeah.
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
Bang.
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
It's getting bigger.
Darryl is dating Val... still.
Yeah, we did it.
Da  na na na na!!
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
Thank you.
That's my office.
I hate myself.
It's trivia.
[Low singing] Old, mill, stream.
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
Who?
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
Cool.
[reads text] 'Are you watching this?' Seriously?
We can look into it.
Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
Actually, you did.
A buyout.
Hell yeah!
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
He died.
Hey, Andy.
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
You should stop calling yourself 'baby daddy.'
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
Should you drive the forklift?
I can go get us some tacos.
So you still missing Ryan?
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
Nice.
Mmmmm.
C'mon Gwenneth.
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
What's under your shirt?
Iverson. Yeah, always man. It's very important.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Cool.
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
What do you mean ���they left���?
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
I agree. I think it's superb.
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
What? [Jim shrugs] How about yesterday?
Make a delivery.
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
You went to Cornell?
Something wrong with the doll?
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
I got Source Code on the way back.
No, um... I have.
Then why did you say 'Jackson Five?'
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
Think that through for a sec.
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
It's bad.
When did I get so fat?
What, you don't like the blues?
Sold! To Jim.
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
You can owe me.
But you're singing it.
I���ll take a look.
To the arcade.
I thought you'd wear a sweater.
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Daaamn!  Mad respect for my brotha!
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
Dunder Mifflin.
Good luck to you.
Tell 'em your story, Hide.
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
Yes.
Get under your chin first. Yeah.
That's good.
I got a game. Cow surfing.
Did you hire 'em?
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
Ahem!
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
Do you understand that?
Excuse me?
All right, let���s get this over with.
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
Which me am I gonna be today?
Do it!
Damn that was cold.
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Because I wanted you to like me.
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
Yeah where is it?
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
Oh my goodness.
Welcome to the warehouse.
Cool.
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
No no no no.  I like her.
[to camera] There it is.
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
Got it.
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
Yeah.
You remember? Yes!
Hey, let's call this what it is.
[to Jim] What are you doing?
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
Hey!
2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
Thank you go much.
[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
What's up man?
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
We're going skating.
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
Uh��� yeah. Depending on traffic.
Be quiet.
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
That's my go-to thermos. That's all.
Go ahead.
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
This is not a good idea right here.
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
I'm out. And so is Toby.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Oh, thanks. Thanks. No.
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
They have fast food in Philly.
No. No.
Hey, what���s up?
Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
What?  I can't hear you.
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
Damn!
No.
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
You���re gonna po��� mouth
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
Hmhmm.
Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Nine first.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
This is too good.
Oh, don't worry about it.
Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
Come down, okay?
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
I find you absolutely ribbiting!
This is the last of it.
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah. Mo'fo, mo'fo.
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
Hunger for hamburger.
Hey Mike.
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
Oh [bleep] yeah.
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
OK, great.
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
No.
This was your freshman year.
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
Look, would ya... look.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
This trip was longer than I thought.
Good morning.
Things? People?
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
You a baby daddy?
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
Okay.
That's okay, Mike.
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
That's it.
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
Silent. Look, congratulations.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
OK, don't fire me.
Kelly ordered this online.
Song's about truth.
You're on.
It's all good, we got this.
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
OK.
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
What's wrong with you?
Taking a load off huh?
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
All right. Thanks, man.
Sup?
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.
We got an offer on the table.
Yeah. We're cool.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
So?
You wanna make me happy? Huh?
What's something you really care about?
That felt really good, actually.
[trying not to laugh] Okay.
Right.
Would you just fire me, man?
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
Who knows what the belt is for?
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
We're friends. We're friends.
Toby! Dwight!  Is that them?
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
Start over.
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
I didn't say anything.
What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.
Hey, get off.
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
Mmhmm. [points at gabe] Caramel soy latte.
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
Dwight.
I'll be there.
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
I say we have a parade.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
You haven't even introduced yourself.
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
I'm not mad. Are you mad?
Oh, hey. Hey, what���s up, y���all?
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Pam.
What else could you possibly be forgetting?
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
All right.
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
Cool. Hey, thanks���
Yeah, I've seen Santa.
It says decaf. You get me decaf?
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
That there's a woman's suit.
Looks that way.
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
Good luck with that.
You didn't have to boo him.
What's his name?
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
I had to. I needed defense.
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
Roy left years ago. What's his name?
Mike.
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
Both.
Take your shot man!
That could work.
Dunder Mifflin.
Are you serious?
I'm very busy here, man.
Dwight!
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
[playing ping-pong] Game, son!
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
Paper business.
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
Hey, Pam! How are you?
Michael.
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
Why?
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
[laughs] Are you serious?  You're earning this?
I know, right.  Merry Christmas.
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
What have you done for me?
[rubs face in exasperation]
Uh, 'The moon is huge tonight.'
What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
You want me to invite Matt?
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
OK.
Make that face he likes.
How about you, man.  Comfortable?
Yeah.
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
That's what we gotta do.
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
No do not touch it!
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
No. I was clearing my throat.
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
Has that ever happened? Ever?
I was in The Whiz in high school.
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
Scoopity-splash!
I wasn't.
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Yeah, well, watcha gonna do?
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
Thanks, it's cool. So...
It's Lejon Brames.
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
Oh yeah.
Forget it, man.
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
I'll come with you.
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
What? You making bread?
I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
This is what you want?
You chose one thing?
Summing up.
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
[sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
What do we have here?
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
Kind of embarassing.
I���m lifting.
I did.
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
I'm in.
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
Four hours. Almost halfway there.
Yeah, this isn't happening.
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
There you go.
One, two, three, hit it.
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Good slam.
My priority is safety.
I���ll introduce you.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
Thank you.
No, no, no...
J-j-j-ju...
Are you wearin' lady clothes?
Ho-ho!
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
But we get paid a lot less.
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Well, it's effective.
You gotta include me in the conversation.
You're such a great friend.'
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
Why, did you meet someone?
OK.
Alright, we outta here.
Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Help me!
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
Slow down, think it over.
Here you go.
Good morning.
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
That���s what I���m talkin��� about.
Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
WHAT!?
This... [removes camera headset]
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
If you don't mind.
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
[sighs] Dinkin' flicka.
She was about to turn 97.
This party���s tight.  The fog is cool.
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
We're loading at one.
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
That sounds awesome!
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
Who knew, right?
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
Uh huh.
I was still thinking of going back to school.
It is worth it.
Every day.
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
Yup.
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
Eat it.
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
Thank you.
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
No man, we are.
She thought I was McNabb. [laughing]
I don't
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
Goodnight.
No big deal. No big deal.
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
We wanted to give you something.
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it.
[watching you tube video, laughing]
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
It's not even a thought���
[setting stopwatch] Go.
Everybody got a government cow.
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Damn!
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
What's
Hey, are we doing this thing?
You're the tutorial.
Mm hmm.
What's rap?
Oh, ok.
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
I hate that too.
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
Hey.
She's got a boyfriend.
Put it on, man.
Subway sandwiches.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Thinking about my grandmother a lot.
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
Hey.
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
Yeah!  Da  na na na na.
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
Popsicles?
The space dust does it.
And?
It has been processed.
What's up, Mike?
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
Hey man.
Sounds great.
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
No.
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
Yes. How did he do?
Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
No.
Cheeseburger or hamburger.
It���s ok E-Dog, just who called?
Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Alright, yeah fine so whatever...
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
What?
I've seen this, that's not you.
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
I included some time saving ideas...
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
That happens a lot?
Oh yeah.
Yeah. [music starts]
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
Fun.
Mmm. [they clink cups]
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
Yeah.
Wrap it up, Gabe.
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
I can videotape it.
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
Seriously?
No.
Fourteen years long.
Make a real gym.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
I can't. You know that.
Mm-hmm
That was never agreed upon.
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Mike.
Hey.
You too... Darryl.
No, no, no.
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
Hey.
Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers.
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
That's a great plan.
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
I wouldn't enjoy that.
Hey what's up? You called?
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
Send me one too.
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
I don���t do that anymore.
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
Can���t do what?
Yes sir. Thanks.
Well, it���s been great.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
Here we go. Go get him, Mike!
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
Congratulations, baby!
How about the sales department is the sails?
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
I'ma call Roy, man.
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
What?
[to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack.
Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.
What's wrong with a level playing field?
[entering] What are y���all doing?
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
Nah. I play for pleasure.
Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
What? All right!
Clever, Mike.
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
All right, I made it up.
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
I worked at a Jiffy Lube.
You���re a bad man Andy Bernard.
Boo! Boo!
All right. Se you later...
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
To push this bar up.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
YEAH! Da  na na na na.
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
Good policy. Sensible. Smart.
Thanks man.
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
You guys lost four pounds.
Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
Um, where did you get that story?
Man, hook you up.
It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.
Who needs it?
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I���m gonna let them think the other thing.
All right.
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
Life hacking, man.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
You feel connected to his baby over there?
Yes.
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
I know who did that.
Val. You made it.
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
Hey, what's up?
My bad.
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
Yeah.
My daughter.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
No! No no no no no!  I said
Then I think you should fire me.
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
You must be pretty strong, huh?
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
I don't understand the point of a hat.
I don't know.
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
Who's it?
[sighs]
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
I���m going for a walk.
Getting my sweat on.
Correct.
Good times.
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
The experience...
What college did you go to Mike?
Alright! [high fives Pam]
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
It's defense.
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
Da  na na na na.
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
You know.
The coconut's pretty subtle.
No. You're wrong.
So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.
Look man this is a bad idea.
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
You did good. Real good.
[Looking at Jim confused] That's great.
Sure, sweetie.
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
Right on, son.
Yeah, I guess���
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
You said no to this one!
The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
What are you doing here, Gabe?
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
Yeah, she ended things.
What are you doing with my lunch?
I got that cutie behind the counter.
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
Mm, it's not that big.
Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
[whispering] They're a bunch of jackals.
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
Uh, no.
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
Hey Andy.
Not really.
Rachel from the party?
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
I can hear you.
Comfortable, Mike?
Let���s get a drink in you, huh?
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
Hey, Mike.
She did?
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
This is gonna make him feel better.
Next exit isn't for five miles.
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Nah, nah...
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
No.
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
I'm telling you how to do this man.
No, I'm good. Keep them.
I'm sitting right here.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
What do you say?
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
They smell so bad.
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
And I will take you all down.
Three Kings.
Looking good, RC!
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
You don't say?
Hey, how'd you do?
Oh, hey Val.
Way
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Hmm. Yeah right
Yeah.
[pats Andy on the back] Thank you.
If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
You done?
Hiding from his momma.
What's up, Roy?
127 hours. It's about this guy who-
[Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo!
Cool. It should be taller though, right?
Boo! Boo!
Let me see it!
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
Yeah.
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
You talk to Wade and Colin?
Yeah, it's a little much.
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
Obviously, so happy for them both.
Look how happy he is.
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
Jim really doesn���t want to come?
What?
You could go downstairs and ask them?
Correction: we don't care.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
You gotta stop texting me so much.
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
Let me see it.
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
What's up man? I'm Darryl.
Newsies.
That was a good one.
He���s been sailing for two days.
Hi.
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
Paper material, ma'am.
I shall come by at your convenience.
[sighs] I���m gonna miss the paper business.
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
We���re in play, baby.
You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
No.
You missed a spot.
Sure.
I'll take one of those pink pouches.
How much did you pay for that?
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Yes, Shawn Marion.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
You think you could beat me up?
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
He does not like that wall.
Thank you. Thank you. No.
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Why do you wanna work here?
Were the boxes near each other?
Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.
Show them what you brought, Mike.
I didn't say 'a'ight.'
Maybe forever. Anyhow���
Oh, yeah?
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
I'll be your croak monsieur.
What?
Mike.
Okay. I'll keep working.
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
Take them at the same time.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Except my warehouse.
No, no, no. Maybe just later.
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
So how was the drive in?
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
Me.
He's got to go, Mike.
My pleasure.
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
What?
What kind of job?
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
Why would you think a lady is me?
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
Really?
Yes, this is the one.
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
[tears welling up in his eyes]
Dallas indeed.
Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
But... [Val kisses Darryl]
I haven't hired anyone.
There's nothing out here man.
Alright.
We should play it.
Andy, sing us another song.
Rosebud?
How much?
Presbyterian.
Yeah.
More universal.
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
Yes, yes, yes.
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Dwight, come back and spot me.
Why?
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Dreaming he's a dog on a island.
