Uh, yeah. What is it?
[laughs] Thank you.
Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap]
OK.
Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
Spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh]
Dive in right here.
[knocks Erin off Dwight's shoulders] Yes!
What?
Yeah!
Andy! Hey!
Whoo!
Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.
Bye [kiss]...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.
You guys ready?
Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office.
Oh! [laughs] Oof!
I'll see you at home?
It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Go away.
What are you doing here?
Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
I can't say it doesn't make sense...
Oh.
[to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.
Here we go! [knocks Erin over] Yes!
You're breaking up with me?
Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?
Oh
Hi.
OK [laughs] Bye.
Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?
[sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?
Yeah, come on!
Okay. You don't know what you're doing.
Did you not...
That's uh, that's the girl you dated.
I'll let him know.
[looks at pool] Wow.
I dunno.
Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.
No, she, she seems fine.
Hey.
My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
I cannot believe it either.
Ah..[laughs]
OK
Hey.
Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
No, show me.
