They'll do it.

Hi, Satan.

Oh! But he's not ready yet.

Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride...

Doing great kids! Come on! 

And to you, my friend. 

Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!

Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses.

And I'm telling you there's more to this than you think!  And if you want to save your marriage, and your face, you need to figure it out quick.

Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back!

I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight.

Terry, I'm your friend. And I'm not just your friend, I'm also your boddy

Waaaah!

If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-

Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise!  And... Proper Diet. 

Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet. 

There's more to this, Terry. A lady never queefs in her lord's face without some major cause. You started as the Canadian Minister of Health and three months later your wife queefed in your face. There's a connection.

Oh, don't thank us. We failed you.

Well, okay, but, you are a hater.

Naturally.

Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!

Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!

Hey kids!

Bubbye. 

You're a dick, Scott!

Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?

They can lose the weight if they try.

Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan,  who's another weight counselor! 

Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?

I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?

Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd. 

I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.

Tom, I'm standing in front of the jelly school, where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl. We're being told if she doesn't stop the-

I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get yo oriented.  I'll take care of him from here, ma'am.

Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place!

Wait a second.  Do you kids hear something?  I could've swore that-

Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!

Well, it's alright with me. Parents?

Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is  fun, right gang?

You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.

All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.

Is it working?

So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT

And we're gonna reach for the sky... 

Have you and your wife seen a therapist together?

What's happening?

Iiii...
ate my son for a Blu-ray play-er
With a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle jang-le
My son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho! 
Ho ho jingle jing-le
Jingle jingle jang-le
Jingle jingle jingle ho ho!

It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!

Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein!

Good-bye, Chad.

A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks.

Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave.

And up to the sky... 

It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong-

Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!
