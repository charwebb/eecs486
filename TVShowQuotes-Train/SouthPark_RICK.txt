Yes, yes that's right, we had to eat him. We were all sort of starving out here, so we drew straws, and he drew the shortest one.

I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get yo oriented.  I'll take care of him from here, ma'am.

They can lose the weight if they try.

Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise!  And... Proper Diet. 

So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT

Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!

Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back!

And I'm telling you there's more to this than you think!  And if you want to save your marriage, and your face, you need to figure it out quick.

If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-

All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.

Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is  fun, right gang?

Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses.

Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?

It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!

I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?

Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!

There's more to this, Terry. A lady never queefs in her lord's face without some major cause. You started as the Canadian Minister of Health and three months later your wife queefed in your face. There's a connection.

Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave.

You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.

Tom, I'm standing in front of the jelly school, where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl. We're being told if she doesn't stop the-

Wait a second.  Do you kids hear something?  I could've swore that-

Terry, I'm your friend. And I'm not just your friend, I'm also your boddy

That must be it. Don't you see, Terry? That health care integration system has made you defensive and hostile, and your wife's been puttin' up with it.

I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight.

Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan,  who's another weight counselor! 

Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time!

Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd. 

Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!

I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.

Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!

Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?

It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong-

A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks.

Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride...

Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet. 

Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place!
