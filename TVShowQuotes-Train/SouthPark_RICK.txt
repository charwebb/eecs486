Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet. 
Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd. 
A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks.
Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?
I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.
Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses.
I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?
Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!
Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back!
That must be it. Don't you see, Terry? That health care integration system has made you defensive and hostile, and your wife's been puttin' up with it.
Have you and your wife seen a therapist together?
Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise!  And... Proper Diet. 
Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!
Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave.
It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong-
And I'm telling you there's more to this than you think!  And if you want to save your marriage, and your face, you need to figure it out quick.
They can lose the weight if they try.
Terry, I'm your friend. And I'm not just your friend, I'm also your boddy
All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.
Yes, yes that's right, we had to eat him. We were all sort of starving out here, so we drew straws, and he drew the shortest one.
So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT
Wait a second.  Do you kids hear something?  I could've swore that-
Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time!
Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?
I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get yo oriented.  I'll take care of him from here, ma'am.
You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.
Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere.  Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some  crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, "How did this happen?" 
Tom, I'm standing in front of the jelly school, where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl. We're being told if she doesn't stop the-
Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!
If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-
Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is  fun, right gang?
Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride...
Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place!
Iiii...
ate my son for a Blu-ray play-er
With a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle jang-le
My son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho! 
Ho ho jingle jing-le
Jingle jingle jang-le
Jingle jingle jingle ho ho!
Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan,  who's another weight counselor!
