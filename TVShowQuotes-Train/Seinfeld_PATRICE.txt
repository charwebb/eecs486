No, I asked for the truth. Thank you for being so honest.
Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help you but I'll need the copies.
You're just trying to take it all back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here.
I know what you said. You can't change that.
Everyone in my family's creative. And even though I'm working as an accountant now I'd really like to eventually live exclusively on my pappe-ay mache-ay hats
You're not telling me the truth. I must have done something.
I prefer to go alone. How much do I owe?
It's my creative outlet. One of my passions.
And you didn't comment on the chop sticks.
They're art. You hang them on the wall.
So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?
Don't give me cliches. I have a right to know. What did I do wrong?
Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?
