Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved.
I sometimes have sick fancies.  And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play.
Things aren't always as they seem, Pip.  Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?
And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you! 
Come closer, Pip.  My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?
Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip?  Look at the way he holds her hand.
Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall "play" some more. 
Yes. Cry away, males.  Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete.
Yes. Tell me about the pain.  Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.
Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe.
Come closer. Look at me.  Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?
Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces.
Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well.  She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her? 
Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.
Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin.
Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip. 
And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper.  Lover her.
There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!
Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it.
