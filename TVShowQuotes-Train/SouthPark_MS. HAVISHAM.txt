Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device.  You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation.
There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!
Things aren't always as they seem, Pip.  Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?
Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin.
Yes. Tell me about the pain.  Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.
Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip. 
Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it.
And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper.  Lover her.
Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well.  She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her? 
Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces.
I sometimes have sick fancies.  And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play.
And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you! 
Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?
Come closer. Look at me.  Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?
Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved.
Yes. Cry away, males.  Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete.
Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe.
Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall "play" some more. 
Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip?  Look at the way he holds her hand.
