Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhand. How can you have hand like a scissor, huh? Show me one person who's got hand like a scissor.
Did you get it? (comparing the hairs) Oh you done good Newman.
You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.
Take your time. (Gino leaves) You happy with the haircut?
Yea. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.
I'm going to kill the both of you.
Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up.
It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.
Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair.
It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been with me for so long. You're so loyal.
(He pulls Jerry into the barber chair. Jerry is trying to get away but can't.) Eh, what's the difference. It takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special for you.
You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like the funny business.
Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? (yelling) What are you going to do on the toilet?
