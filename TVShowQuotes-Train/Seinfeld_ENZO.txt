It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been with me for so long. You're so loyal.
Yea. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.
Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up.
You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.
You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like the funny business.
Did you get it? (comparing the hairs) Oh you done good Newman.
I'm going to kill the both of you.
How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.
Take your time. (Gino leaves) You happy with the haircut?
Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhand. How can you have hand like a scissor, huh? Show me one person who's got hand like a scissor.
It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.
Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair.
