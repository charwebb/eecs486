Ha!  So! You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh? I guess now you're gonna start torturing me! Well!  Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don't squeeze them anymore!
How dare you call me crazy! This means war! 
Yeah...  I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?!
Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first.  But I won't tell you where I keep my money.  You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!
Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You wanna get outta here? Talk to me. 
I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!
You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!
Ha! So you do intend to torture me, huh?!  Well go ahead! Do your worst!  You still won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out!
I have to use that money to build my church! I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church! And do you know why?! So I can play banjo!  Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!
You can't not like The Passion! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home. 
Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!
You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you?  Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!
