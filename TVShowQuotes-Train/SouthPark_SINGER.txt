A big, fat turd or a stupid douche. Which do you like best?

Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all
I got to buy ChinpokomonI got to buy it, I got to buy it! 
We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future begins with you and me.
We can start to make a difference if we want it for our children
Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins with you and me.

The day is approaching to give it your best
You've got to reach your prime!
That's when you need to put yourself to the test
And show us the passage of time
We're gonna need a montage (Montage)
A sports-training montage (Montage)
And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.
Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?)
And with every shot, show a little improvement
To show it won't take too long
That's called a montage (Montage)
Even Rocky had a montage (Montage)
In any sport, if you want to go
From just a beginner to a pro
You'll need a montage (Montage)
a simple little montage (Montage)
Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)
If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)
Montage (Montage)
We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.
He's right. It's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing.

Lemmiwinks, King of Gerbils, stop your brother of doom!
He's still lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time... 
He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.
