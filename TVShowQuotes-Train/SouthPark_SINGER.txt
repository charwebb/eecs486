Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it steal your soul away.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Light the fire. Take control.

Don't let it take your soul.
Burn down, burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
And take control.
Burn down... Hot Topic.
Burn it down... Hot Topic.

Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all

Goin' to try to ride all day long, but I'm goin' to fail'Cause it's Wild Wacky Action Bike!

The future begins with you and me.

The Catholic Boat's gonna be headin' on out today.
The Catholic Boat. Time to throw all of your cares away.
Get some hot Christian action; it'll make you-

We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.

(over the Braniff Airlines logo) Bye bye buh-buh-buh-buh-buh chicken!

(Jackin' it, jackin' it, jackin' it jack
Spankin' it, spankin' it, smackin' it smack
A whackin' it, whackin' it, whackin' it whack
Smackin' it, jerkin' it, smackin' it smack)
The cars are passin' me by, they're honkin', say hello.

Destroying all he sees

A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward, Lemmiwinks, or you will soon be dead.
The journey before you may be long and filled with woe
But you must escape the gay man's ass so your tale can be told.
Lemmiwinks. Lehehemiwinks Lemmiwinks Lemmiwinks-

I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon! 

Ultura Lenardu Marutin! 

Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.

You and the dark one, Cthulhu

Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me,
Calling me all the time like Blondie.
Check out my Chrissie behind,
It's fine all of the time.
Like sex on the beaches,
What else is in the teaches of peaches?
Huh, what?

The evil hate-filled Cthulhu, from a dimension far away.Flying through gates of madness and into your heart

...and the home of the... brave! 

Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free.I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.

Never-

Turning dreams into nightmares

So much sufferin'... 

I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.

He beat the wife and sleeps it offAlabama Man!

I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...

''Wikileaks, the bum hacker with a heart of doom.Everyone knows the gerbil king, but no one ever speaksOf Lemminwinks's brother, the evil Likiweaks...

We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.Take the first step and you will see the future-

A smuggy day in San Francisco town.

You and the dark one, Cthulhu
Sharing adventures and smiles,
It's a magical bond two pals can share.
Soon the whole world will be made aware of
You and the death lord, Cthulhu
Makin' the world a better place.
Together you will have so much fun

But in the end we know we're good for each other
Two peas in a pod, Future Self -n- MeFuture Self -n- Me, Future Self -n-
Me

He's still lookin' good, with all those... sub sandwiches... 

He's right. It's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing. 

Here we are, face to face, "My Future Self -n- Me" 

One of them's messy, the other one's clean!
Gettin' along isn't always easy, sometimes we disagree

Let's get out the vote! Let's make our voices heard!
We've been given the right to choose between a douche and a turd.
It's democracy in action! Put your freedom to the test.
A big, fat turd or a stupid douche. Which do you like best?

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.

The day is approaching to give it your best
You've got to reach your prime!
That's when you need to put yourself to the test
And show us the passage of time
We're gonna need a montage (Montage)
A sports-training montage (Montage)
And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.
Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?)
And with every shot, show a little improvement
To show it won't take too long
That's called a montage (Montage)
Even Rocky had a montage (Montage)
In any sport, if you want to go
From just a beginner to a pro
You'll need a montage (Montage)
a simple little montage (Montage)
Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)
If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)
Montage (Montage)

Chinpokomon! 

He can bowl, he can drink, he can drink and bowlAlaba-ma Man!

Veins swell
You know me, Ellen
Enough to tell
Five steps, you're over

What's goin' on in this world o'mine?There's a whole lot of killin' in this world o'mine. Somebody's gotta help this world o'mine...

You've got the strength, you've got the courage
Even with a dead fetus on your head
You carry on
You fight for tomorrow
Dead fetus or no, you never let go
You're my conjoined-twin-dead-thing-hanging-off-your-head woman

He's still lookin' good!
His name is Jared
His name is Jared and he likes to eat the sandwiches...

If I could swim with the dolphins, the soft and gentle dolphins...Why can't I swim with the dolphins?

He's still lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time... 

We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future begins with you and me.
We can start to make a difference if we want it for our children
Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins with you and me.

Bar-bura, Bar-bura! 

The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
