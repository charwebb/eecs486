Oh? What happened?
Here's my card.
(howling with laughter) Stop it, you're killing me!!
Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.
It was really nice meeting you.
Yeah, I know!
So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
No.
Hello!
It's delicious.
I'm handling his case!
I gotta go.
I think it's curdled.
Non-fat?
Oo.
That's so sad. What do you do?
Ping is my cousin!
Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.
Ha hea.
How about this?
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.
No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.
Please don't.
That's right!
Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.
Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.
I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.
Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.
He never said anything funny.
Was he Chinese?
I understand.
I'm very attracted to him.
Is your last name Benes?
I thought he was dark and disturbed.
Would you like to join us?
Nice meeting you.
