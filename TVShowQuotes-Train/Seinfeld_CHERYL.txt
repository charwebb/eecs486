Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.
Oh? What happened?
How about this?
Ping is my cousin!
That's right!
It was really nice meeting you.
I'm very attracted to him.
That's so sad. What do you do?
Is your last name Benes?
I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.
Was he Chinese?
I understand.
I thought he was dark and disturbed.
I gotta go.
I'm handling his case!
Ha hea.
Non-fat?
No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.
Nice meeting you.
Hello!

Here's my card.
Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.
It's delicious.
Hi.
Would you like to join us?
Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.

Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.
He never said anything funny.
Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.
You're a very serious person, aren't you?
Oo.
So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
Do you ever laugh?
