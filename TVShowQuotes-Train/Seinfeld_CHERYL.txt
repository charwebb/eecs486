Non-fat?
Oh? What happened?
Ping is my cousin!
So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
I'm very attracted to him.
I think it's curdled.
Is your last name Benes?
Yeah, I know!
It's delicious.
Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.
Hi.
I thought he was dark and disturbed.
That's so sad. What do you do?
Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.
No.
I gotta go.
Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.
I understand.
(howling with laughter) Stop it, you're killing me!!
How about this?
Do you ever laugh?
Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.
He never said anything funny.
Please don't.
Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.
Here's my card.
I'm handling his case!
Was he Chinese?
You're a very serious person, aren't you?
Nice meeting you.
Would you like to join us?
It was really nice meeting you.
No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.
Oo.
Ha hea.
