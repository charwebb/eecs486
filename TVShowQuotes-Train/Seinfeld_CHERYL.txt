He never said anything funny.
Was he Chinese?
Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.
No.
Do you ever laugh?
Hello!
I understand.
Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.
I thought he was dark and disturbed.
Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.
I'm handling his case!
Would you like to join us?
No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.
That's so sad. What do you do?
Is your last name Benes?
Non-fat?
Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.
Yeah, I know!
So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
I think it's curdled.
Here's my card.
You're a very serious person, aren't you?
Ping is my cousin!
Nice meeting you.
Oo.
Oh? What happened?
How about this?
Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.
I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.
I'm very attracted to him.
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.
It's delicious.
It was really nice meeting you.
That's right!
I gotta go.
Ha hea.
