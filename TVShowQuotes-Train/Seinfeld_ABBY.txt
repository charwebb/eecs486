Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while.
Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much.
He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore.
Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor.
You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship.
Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to have an advisor.
I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Bania Saturday and then catch his act.
And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a protg?
I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.
Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think it's over.
My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.
Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protg is a hack.
I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me.
I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.
