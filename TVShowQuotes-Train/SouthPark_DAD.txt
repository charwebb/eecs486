All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon!

Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!

Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?

What the heck? 

The baby!

Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby.

Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person.

Okay, my turn.  Ooo, five!  One two three four five. Uh, awww, lost yor mortgage, pay ten thousand dollars! Oh no! 

Well, we'll get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right? 

You're making a mistake!  Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack! 

You have to share your room with the baby!

Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.

This is the oddest holiday special I've ever seen.

I'll leave you two alone.  Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were.

And we all know what happened then, don't we?

We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and-

I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim.

Okay, then. 

Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.

Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!

In the dining room Michael! Let's go!  Have a seat, son.  Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while.

Yeah, we've got a commenter window in our living room. How do I get rid of that?

Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan. 

Oh?

Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school.

Jim, it's your father!

Jimmy?

Jimmy, were you masturbating?

...Gosh.

Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world?? 

This damn TV! What is that window doing outside the holiday special?! 

Okay. Well, you have a visitor. 

All right, you rascals. Gather round.  Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s.
