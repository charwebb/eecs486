What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady!
Well, we'll get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right? 
I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim.
Okay, my turn.  Ooo, five!  One two three four five. Uh, awww, lost yor mortgage, pay ten thousand dollars! Oh no! 
All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon!
Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan. 
Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school.
Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby.
Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.
All right, you rascals. Gather round.  Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s.
You're making a mistake!  Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack! 
This is the oddest holiday special I've ever seen.
We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and-
Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!
And we all know what happened then, don't we?
In the dining room Michael! Let's go!  Have a seat, son.  Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while.
This damn TV! What is that window doing outside the holiday special?! 
You have to share your room with the baby!
Yeah, we've got a commenter window in our living room. How do I get rid of that?
Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person.
Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world?? 
Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor!
I'll leave you two alone.  Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were.
