What the heck? 

All right, you rascals. Gather round.  Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s.

...Gosh.

The baby!

This is the oddest holiday special I've ever seen.

All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon!

Okay, my turn.  Ooo, five!  One two three four five. Uh, awww, lost yor mortgage, pay ten thousand dollars! Oh no! 

Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?

Oh?

Okay. Well, you have a visitor. 

Okay, then. 

In the dining room Michael! Let's go!  Have a seat, son.  Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while.

Yeah, we've got a commenter window in our living room. How do I get rid of that?

Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!

I'll leave you two alone.  Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were.

Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.

Jim, it's your father!

What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady!

Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan. 

Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person.

Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.

Well, we'll get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right? 

This damn TV! What is that window doing outside the holiday special?! 

Jimmy, were you masturbating?

I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim.

And we all know what happened then, don't we?

Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school.

Hi Stan!

You have to share your room with the baby!

Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world?? 

Jimmy?

Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!

We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and-
