Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?

And the Lords of the Underworld!

The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.

Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top! 

Ey, shut up, tubby!

Hey dudes. 

Mmmmm 

Hey man, don't be shy.

You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said! 

Huh-I don't know, man.  Whoaaa!

Ye Yeah-ha.

What the hell is this?!

Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe!  'Sup Mark?  'Sup up. Jonesy? 

Give it up, babe!

What the? 

Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.

We've just gotta practice more.

No clothes, right.

It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!

Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.

Red Rocket spills my icy soul.
Demons from Hell seek the chosen one!

Beat it, chubby!

Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on!  I don't need Timmy!  I'm goin' solo!

Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?

Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!

Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!

Listen to them. They really love me.  Wooo!!

1 2 3 4 

If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there!  Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!

O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?

Shut up! 

I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar.

I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them. 

You a singer, man?

Bridge!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of Shelly
Shelly!

Don't you know? Isn't...

Yeah?

Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will!

Huh?

I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head... 

Why the hell not?!

You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you!  Umph  Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh!  Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!

Mmmmm 

They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld. 

What do you say, Timmy? 

Yeah! Come on! Give it up!

Yeah!

Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run. 

Mmmmm. 

Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the best of its kind, and not a scratch on it. 

Right here, Miss Hayek!

Yes! I'm a rocker! 

But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.

Come on, babih!

Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot. 

Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice. 

Yeah. All of them chanting "Timmy, Timmy."

Mmmmm. 

Uh, thanks man. See ya.

And I still don't get any action.

Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly. 
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly, Shelly.

Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room. 

No! Don't try and stop me, man!  I'll see you on fame's backside.
