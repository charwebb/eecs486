They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld. 

Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.

You're not putting out for me?

Ye Yeah-ha.

The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.

Hey man, don't be shy.

What the? 

Mmmmm 

No! Don't try and stop me, man!  I'll see you on fame's backside. 

I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head... 

Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot. 

It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!

Bridge!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of Shelly
Shelly!

Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!

Give it up, babe!

Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room. 

But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.

Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God damnit!  Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night!  My guitar! NOOOOO!

Yeah?

What do you say, Timmy? 

Huh?

Listen to them. They really love me.  Wooo!!

Mmmmm 

1 2 3 4 

Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?

Uh, thanks man. See ya.

Huh-I don't know, man.  Whoaaa!

Mmmmm. 

Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice. 

Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run. 

You a singer, man?

If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there!  Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!

Don't you know? Isn't...

Yes! I'm a rocker! 

Yeah!

I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them. 

Right here, Miss Hayek!

I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar.

Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe!  'Sup Mark?  'Sup up. Jonesy? 

Shut up! 

Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!

You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you!  Umph  Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh!  Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!

Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top! 

Hey dudes. 

Mmmmm. 

We've just gotta practice more.

And the Lords of the Underworld!

You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said! 

O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?

Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on!  I don't need Timmy!  I'm goin' solo!

And I still don't get any action.

Yeah. All of them chanting "Timmy, Timmy."

What the hell is this?!

Yeah! Come on! Give it up!

Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla.

Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?

When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff.

Come on, babih!

Beat it, chubby!

Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?

Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly

Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.

Why the hell not?!
