Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room. 
The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.
Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the best of its kind, and not a scratch on it. 
Red Rocket spills my icy soul.
Demons from Hell seek the chosen one!
I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar.
If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there!  Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!
Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?
Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly. 
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly, Shelly.
You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you!  Umph  Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh!  Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!
Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on!  I don't need Timmy!  I'm goin' solo!
Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly
When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff.
Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God damnit!  Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night!  My guitar! NOOOOO!
Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe!  'Sup Mark?  'Sup up. Jonesy? 
I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them. 
Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!
You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said! 
They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld. 
But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.
Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice. 
Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will!
Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top! 
It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!
O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?
Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?
No! Don't try and stop me, man!  I'll see you on fame's backside. 
Bridge!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of Shelly
Shelly!
Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!
I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head... 
Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.
