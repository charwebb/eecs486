You think so? Let me see it  Maybe I can kill it.
I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.
Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but  you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment.
It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip.  He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very  I'm  leaving. 
That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.
I don't want to kill any more of them.
We're going to play a little game called, "Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."
Pip, you must know that I have no heart.
Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden. 
You may kiss me if you like.  Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden. 
Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?
I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!
Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?
Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.
I suppose.  So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?
