Three dollars and fifty cents.

So I chased the monster down the street, you see...

The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no...  Cock!

Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light.

This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids.

Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, "What do you want from me, alien?!" and do you know what he said?

It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-

Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!

Could I have your attention please?  Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady.  I'm very happy for them both.  Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now.

and I yelled. I said, "What do you want from us, monster?!" And the monster bent down and said, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty." 

And is this the children you told us about?

Over here!

Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, "tree-fitty." And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!

Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.

Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing.

Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!

Cocknut! Augh... Stupid shit!

Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, "Poppa, poppa!" I said "What do you need, Chef, my boy?", and he said, "...I need about tree-fitty."

Help us with the drones spying on us!!

Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit!

Hold on, now, I'll see if I have tree-fitty!

Mom, can we just go home, please?

Well come on in out of the cold now.  There's heavy fog on the moors tonight.  Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nelly.

And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-

...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that.

She gave him a dollar.

There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now!

But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.

It's okay, honey.

She's a goddam Succubus!

I said, "Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!" It said, "how about just two-fitty?" I said, "Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!"

It's okay honey, the-

How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!

Damn right, I was angry!

Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw Christmas, there it goes again!

I want tuh go!  Shitfag!

Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we could Kenny's soul into its body. 

Raisin oatmeal, and I said "We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?" And she looks at me and she says, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty."

Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!

That's right. I said "I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"

In the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free!

All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!

Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents  Aw shit!  My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.

Aw shit!

Yes, right now. 

Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the...

Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!

You know what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone!

You've got a problem, Stotch!

Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!

So, thuh so you flew it back here in time.

Asshole ASSHOLE.

Aah, shut your mouth, woman!

Oh.

Oh for God's sakes!  Goddamnit get the hell out of here!  That DOES IT!

N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!

Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!

Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.

Aw shit! COCK!

I said, "Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!"

I'll "Oh" whoever I want! 

Suck it! Asshole licker dickfart!

What is this sword?

Well these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! 

Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!

God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!

With who?

Come on out hyow! It's safe!  Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh! 

And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-

Stupid shit! Cock! 

You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!

We're here to find out why?!

No. Cocknose!

You would?

Mom, let's just go. Shhhit!

August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-

What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
