How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!
Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.
Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we could Kenny's soul into its body. 
Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!
That's right. I said "I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"
Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!
Well these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! 
What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids.
Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the...
Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!
Help us with the drones spying on us!!
Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.
Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, "Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?" He said, "My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it." I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!
Could I have your attention please?  Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady.  I'm very happy for them both.  Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now.
Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!
Well come on in out of the cold now.  There's heavy fog on the moors tonight.  Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nelly.
N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!
So I chased the monster down the street, you see...
But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.
...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that.
Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw Christmas, there it goes again!
So, thuh so you flew it back here in time.
You know what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone!
Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!
But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.
Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman!  The soul's comin' out hyuh!  It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child!
Well, let's see here now.  Mhm, mhm, mhm.  Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there.
Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, "What do you want from me, alien?!" and do you know what he said?
Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, "tree-fitty." And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!
Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.
It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-
Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light.
and I yelled. I said, "What do you want from us, monster?!" And the monster bent down and said, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty." 
And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-
Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!
Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!
Hold on, now, I'll see if I have tree-fitty!
Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents  Aw shit!  My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.
I said, "Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!"
Come on out hyow! It's safe!  Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh! 
You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!
Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!
And is this the children you told us about?
I said, "Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!" It said, "how about just two-fitty?" I said, "Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!"
Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing.
Raisin oatmeal, and I said "We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?" And she looks at me and she says, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty."
Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, "Poppa, poppa!" I said "What do you need, Chef, my boy?", and he said, "...I need about tree-fitty."
