Oh for God's sakes!  Goddamnit get the hell out of here!  That DOES IT!
N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!
But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.
In the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free!
Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.
Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!
Well, let's see here now.  Mhm, mhm, mhm.  Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there.
I said, "Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!"
Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light.
Could I have your attention please?  Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady.  I'm very happy for them both.  Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now.
Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the...
Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!
How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!
Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw Christmas, there it goes again!
So I chased the monster down the street, you see...
God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!
Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman!  The soul's comin' out hyuh!  It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child!
Help us with the drones spying on us!!
Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, "Poppa, poppa!" I said "What do you need, Chef, my boy?", and he said, "...I need about tree-fitty."
and I yelled. I said, "What do you want from us, monster?!" And the monster bent down and said, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty." 
Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, "What do you want from me, alien?!" and do you know what he said?
You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!
...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that.
Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents  Aw shit!  My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.
Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.
Hold on, now, I'll see if I have tree-fitty!
Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we could Kenny's soul into its body. 
This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids.
Come on out hyow! It's safe!  Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh! 
Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, "Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?" He said, "My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it." I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!
Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!
Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!
But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.
Well come on in out of the cold now.  There's heavy fog on the moors tonight.  Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nelly.
Well these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! 
Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!
What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, "tree-fitty." And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!
August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-
So, thuh so you flew it back here in time.
And is this the children you told us about?
And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-
Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!
Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!
And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-
That's right. I said "I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"
It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-
Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!
