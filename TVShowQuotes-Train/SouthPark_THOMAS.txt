Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.

N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!

Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!

But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.

It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-

Well come on in out of the cold now.  There's heavy fog on the moors tonight.  Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nelly.

Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!

August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-

Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.

Help us with the drones spying on us!!

And is this the children you told us about?

Well, let's see here now.  Mhm, mhm, mhm.  Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there.

Could I have your attention please?  Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady.  I'm very happy for them both.  Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now.

This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids.

So I chased the monster down the street, you see...

Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman!  The soul's comin' out hyuh!  It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child!

Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, "tree-fitty." And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!

Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we could Kenny's soul into its body. 

In the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free!

Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, "Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?" He said, "My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it." I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!

Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the...

...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that.

Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!

Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!

Oh for God's sakes!  Goddamnit get the hell out of here!  That DOES IT!

and I yelled. I said, "What do you want from us, monster?!" And the monster bent down and said, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty." 

Well these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! 

Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!

Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light.

You know what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone!

But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.

And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-

God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!

Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!

Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw Christmas, there it goes again!

Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents  Aw shit!  My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.

That's right. I said "I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"

What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!

Hold on, now, I'll see if I have tree-fitty!

Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing.

And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-

So, thuh so you flew it back here in time.

Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!

I said, "Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!" It said, "how about just two-fitty?" I said, "Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!"

Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, "What do you want from me, alien?!" and do you know what he said?

Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, "Poppa, poppa!" I said "What do you need, Chef, my boy?", and he said, "...I need about tree-fitty."

Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!

Raisin oatmeal, and I said "We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?" And she looks at me and she says, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty."
