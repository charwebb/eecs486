You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away. Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves. It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us. 
It's too late for that, Mr. Kim. Your wife is now our property. We taking her to Los Angeles, where she will work in massage parlor.until she works off the debt.
We smuggled your wife into the United States for you. You were to pay us ten thousand dollars for that service. Yet, we have yet to be paid.
Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice is so beautiful.  To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing. 
Mr. Ru Kim, it appears we have a problem.
Enough!  I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
You don't wanna tell us where she is? All right. Puh la! Ching ga wai pan! 
We quit too.  It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.
Tell us where to find her, Ru Kim! You have no choice.
You thought you could run from us, did you? 
I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business.
Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
