Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low.
Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell! 
I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!
We're done here! Set course for the set of Avatar 2
You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here!
James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron.  James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron. 
This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five.
S.S. Cameron! This is James Cameron! I've found it! My God I found the bar!  Divert all power to sub systems! Two percent oxygen left!  The bar is too heavy! Aaaaagh! Come on you bitch!
Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?
Then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters?  How do YOU account for... Honey Boo Boo? The bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom. If anyone can go down there and raise it back, it's ME.  Let her go!  UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on.
