I caught it.
Honey, I am not sleeping with-
And delivered.
It's how it has to be.
Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy.
Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work.
No.
That's what I'm sayin'.
Alright.
Thanks for the coffee.
Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
OK.
[comes up from under water] How was that?
That's messed up.
It has been delivered.
Isn't that just for popsicles?
Me neither. Come here. [she hugs Darryl, and Darryl smiles behind her back]
Yeah. Thanks.
OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.
Thanks, they're from my mom.
Brandon!
Calm down, he's not.
Ok, thank you. Is that all?
No, I'm good. Thank you.
You're wearing the beanie. You like it?
Hey, Darryl.
Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
Yeah, sure.
Are you really this lazy?
Thank you.
Hey.
Not bad fellas, you're better than you look.
Yeah.
I think the music left without you.
You're not. I believe in us.
Yeah, that's her.
Hey.
Can I help you?
How you doing?
That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab.
Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?
[laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon.
Yeaha���yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.
[stands next to him] Right here?
Can't wait.
Uh, Brandon?
Yup, yup.
You know, you are just as dumb at night.
Great. It was really fun.
Okay, thanks.
Oh I've got him!
Wow. Those are really nice.
Cashmere.
Since when does a sweater mean ���dressed up���? Am I your grandson?
All right guys, clear out.
Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?
Promise me you're going to clean up.
I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim?
Promise me that-
Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out.
As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.
I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?
You in?
Okay.
