Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out.
Me neither. Come here. [she hugs Darryl, and Darryl smiles behind her back]
You know, you are just as dumb at night.
Yeaha���yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.
Since when does a sweater mean ���dressed up���? Am I your grandson?
Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
[laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon.
Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy.
I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?
I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.
That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab.
The Doc crew���s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
[comes up from under water] How was that?
Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Not bad fellas, you're better than you look.
Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?
