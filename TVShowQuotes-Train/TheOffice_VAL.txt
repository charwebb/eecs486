Great. It was really fun.
How you doing?
That's what I'm sayin'.
Thanks, they're from my mom.
Not bad fellas, you're better than you look.
As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.
All right guys, clear out.
Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy.
Yeah. Thanks.
I think the music left without you.
You're not. I believe in us.
It's how it has to be.
Yeah.
[comes up from under water] How was that?
What should I wear?
It has been delivered.
Yeah, sure.
No, I'm good. Thank you.
That's messed up.
And delivered.
Cashmere.
Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
Can I help you?
OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.
Me neither. Come here. [she hugs Darryl, and Darryl smiles behind her back]
Okay.
Uh, Brandon?
I caught it.
Are you really this lazy?
Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out.
Hey.
[stands next to him] Right here?
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?
Alright.
You know, you are just as dumb at night.
Thank you.
That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab.
Since when does a sweater mean ���dressed up���? Am I your grandson?
Ok, thank you. Is that all?
Hey, Darryl.
Promise me you're going to clean up.
Brandon!
Are you asking me on a date?
No.
I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?
[laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon.
Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Isn't that just for popsicles?
Yeah, that's her.
Okay, thanks.
I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work.
You in?
Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?
Wow. Those are really nice.
Hey.
You're wearing the beanie. You like it?
Yup, yup.
Yeaha���yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.
Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Can't wait.
The Doc crew���s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
Calm down, he's not.
Don't quit. [Darryl eavesdropping, nods]
