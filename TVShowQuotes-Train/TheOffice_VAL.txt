I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?
You know, you are just as dumb at night.
OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.
Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy.
[laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon.
That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab.
Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work.
Yeaha���yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.
[comes up from under water] How was that?
I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out.
Me neither. Come here. [she hugs Darryl, and Darryl smiles behind her back]
As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.
Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
Not bad fellas, you're better than you look.
Since when does a sweater mean ���dressed up���? Am I your grandson?
