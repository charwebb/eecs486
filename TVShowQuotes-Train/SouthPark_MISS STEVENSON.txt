I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic.
Ike, we have to get out of here! They'll never let us be together. I think... I think we should go to Milan, like we always talked about. 
Oh uhh, we were just heading back in.
Get your things together. We don't have much time.
Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!
No, but my uncle used to ask me and my twin sister to loss and he'd take pictures.
I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class. 
Okay, just continue with your macaroni pictures. Teacher has to step out for a second. Uh Ike, could you help me out, please?  Oh Ike, I just had to have a second alone with you.
You who don't believe in true love don't understand.
I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do.
I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students.
Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?
I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.
But what about me? I want to talk. 
Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.
You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity.
I'm afraid you're too late.  Are you ready, my love?  Here we go! One, two, three, aaaahhh!  Ike?? 
It's all over, Ike. Milan, the house in Tuscany. They'll never let us be together! We have to go with the backup plan.
