I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic.
I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.
Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.
But what about me? I want to talk. 
It's all over, Ike. Milan, the house in Tuscany. They'll never let us be together! We have to go with the backup plan. 
Okay, just continue with your macaroni pictures. Teacher has to step out for a second. Uh Ike, could you help me out, please?  Oh Ike, I just had to have a second alone with you.
I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do.
I'm afraid you're too late.  Are you ready, my love?  Here we go! One, two, three, aaaahhh!  Ike?? 
Get your things together. We don't have much time.
I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class. 
You who don't believe in true love don't understand.
Oh uhh, we were just heading back in.
I'm at the police station. They say they found some evidence. I'm so scared.  Listen, I want you to know it's okay. If anybody tries to talk to you, you don't need to say anything. Just leave it to me. I know a way out of this.
Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!
Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?
You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity.
I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students.
Ike, we have to get out of here! They'll never let us be together. I think... I think we should go to Milan, like we always talked about.
