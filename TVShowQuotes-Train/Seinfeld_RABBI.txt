Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions.
Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him
You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.
Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?
Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.
My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps
A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.
Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.
Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again.
You know my temple has many single functions.
Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch.
You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?
Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled.
Good evening. And how does this evening find you?
Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.
(On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.
Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .
I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine.
Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going "to happen" for you.
Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.
