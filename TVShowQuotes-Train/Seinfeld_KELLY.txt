That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
How is this a pizza party?
We���re running off into the sunset.
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
You really would?
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
Uh huh. Hold me.
What?
Sometimes.
You did? I wanna see the cake.
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
Ice Cream.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]
Why?
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
Hello.
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
Oh my God, when is it?
She's so wonderful.
Yep. [spreads tablecloth]
It's Eric and Megan.
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
Oh yeah, she loves that headband.
Bye, Angela!
Why is it so tight?
1... 2... 3
Screw you.
Finn.
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
Second opinion on what?
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
Yeah, but everyone else-
Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
Okay, role-playing time!
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Oh, good, that was from me.
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
Ignore her, those glasses are so cool.
What are you referencing?
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
Dwight, get out of my nook!
What?!
Punch him, Toby!
Let go of me!
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
Hi.
Everybody hates those endings!
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
...that I thought you should know ...
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
You're so funny.
What?
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
I just had the longest meeting.
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
That idea sucks.
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
Yeah, what are you doing here?
That's not that bad actually.
But then we wouldn't have any meetings.
Hi-yah!
Ugh, no that thing is
I'm okay!
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
Apology accepted! [hugs Angela]
My resolution was to get more attention.
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
Are you kidding me?
Take that! ��Not so pre-violent anymore!
I do, I do. This isn't right.
You know, some place romantic and expensive.
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
And...
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Definitely, definitely, Jim.
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
Yeah, your nephew is so lame.
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
Big mistake! Huge!'
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
Don't even listen to them. They're so...
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
Cake.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
I get that. I get that.
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
All the time.
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
I was raped.
[in accent] Absolutely!
Screw you.
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason?
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
Michael get to the good part.
Oh, art show!
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
Hey! Is that his scarf?
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
Who's eating all these apples?
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
Well, I think I have that persona.
Yeah.
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
I don't know. Dwight's so weird.
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
What's going on?
Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
I don't know.
I eat beef.
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
On it.
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
Umm, see you later tonight.
Pam, he's just not that into you.
Bye. [Andy barks]
Cool.
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Okay. Bye, Toby.
We're like best friends now!
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Have a seat, I'll write it down.
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
Hell yeah.
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
Yeah, thanks.
OK.
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
This is a fast food receipt from April.
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
God, how many number nines did you order?
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
Well why don't you invite your friends?
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
And you're sorry.
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
Yeah.
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
Eighty-six. Eighty-seven. [singing] Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine.
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
So, you're dumping Michael? Smart.
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
Andy Bernard??
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
I know, obsessed with me much?
Wait, Michael?
This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This
No, seriously Pam, wake up.
Stop yelling at me!
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
I thought they were kind of cute.
What?
[whispering] Come on!
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
Ask where he's from.
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
I don't have any, assh***.
[opening door] Hey guys, sorry I'm late.
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
What emails are you talking about?
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
I hate it.
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
A lot. Black guys mostly.
Ahhh! What's going on?!?!
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Oh, my God...
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
Hey.
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
[gasps] I love it!
1, 2, 3!
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
[mouth full of cake] Me too!
Well, Toby and I did, yeah.
No. I'm gonna count to 3.
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
Rachel.
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
OK. Volley for serve, P. [serves]
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
See? I wasn't lying.
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
Why not?
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
What keeps your glasses on?
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
Why are you eating stem first?
[texting] What song was it?
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
Can we just take those first two things?
I invited him.
Team U.S.A.!
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
[mumbles]
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
How about you Pam?
Oh.
Thanks.
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
Can I be your bridesmaid?
Yeah bitch.
[unwrapping the poster] Yikes.
Thank you, Dwight.
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk.
Can't do what?
I do find that offensive, actually.
Wha���what's Dwight's mothers name.
Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?
Was he still there?
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
I know.
You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
She looks awful.
Oh, god.
Yeah, where are your kids?
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
Mm-hmm.
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
Namaste.
[Screams]
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
Yeah.
Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
[cries, slams fist on desk] Why?
So where's the ring?
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
Mmhmm.
Yeah, it was a great deal.
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
Do you think I should diet?
Oh, my god!
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
Do they still get paid?
What! [cheers]
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
Is Ryan going?
[shakes her head no]
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
[shaking head] Weird.
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
Blankets, what am I, five?
Um, customer service.
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
Good one, Kev.
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
Thank you. [Gabe mumbles]
Because they acted all tough and everything...
Hey, Ryan!
Are you accusing me of something?
[giggles] Thank you.
Oh, hello Ryan.  You look well.
Look, I'm gonna count to 3.
Well help me, OK? Just, uh take...
What happened? Is there a ring?
Should I seduce him?
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
Yeah, it was.
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
What?
Bye, Andy. [kisses his cheek]
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
Eww, what is that?
Oh.
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
It was you.
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
Isn't Gettysburg like three hours away?
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
Me, too Oscar.
Never marrying.
Blow my brains out.
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
Have we met before?
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
[laughing] I love you too.
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
That���s a tablecloth.
Well, his heart was in the right place.
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding]
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
Oh, that is so good.
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
So, how's your day been?
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
Spicy Curry', what's that mean?
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
This doesn't look good.
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
So unnecessary.
...what else do people like?
What'd you say h[bleep]?
What?
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
You prayed for this?
Yeah, he's weird.
Hey, guys.
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
I never know when you're kidding.
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
For you.  I'm with Darryl.
No!
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
Oh my God, I'm so worried.
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
Andy, pick up the phone!
Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly]
Mmhmm.
That's all he wrote.
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
WHAT??
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
Nothing's going on.
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
[bang] Whoa.
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
Definitely some place you can swim.
You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.
Can we speak privately about our relationship?
You're such a ditz.
OK, That's cool. I completely understand.
[doing make up and irritated] What?!
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
I took the tags off already.
She manipulates you.
What are you talking about?
I am so cold.
Come on Scott, please? It's me.
Not so much anymore.
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
Screw you guys. You're dead to me.
No!
Pam?
No.
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
I look
And that, is how it's done.
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
Well then, what's the one true rumor?
Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
I try not to think about it.
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
When Deangelo's around.
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
Cool.
Oh! You scared me!
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
You are so mean.
What drama?
And that is what you call a meet cute.
Decorating.
I know but there was an emergency.
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
Good.
Nope.
It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
Okay, bye honey.
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
Uh, thank you.
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
No problem.
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
Enjoy the snow losers.
Mmm hmm.
Okay?
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
Oh, can I come?
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
Tu Bishvat!
Sparkles...
Hope she's OK.
Fine.
[to Ryan] You're so cool.
Six.
Hey, what's going on?
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
I hear whispering.
I'll text you!
Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
It's
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
I will steal the iPod.
I was kickin' it.
That hotel, it looks so romantic.
Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
This is a bowler-
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
Yeah. It was.
OK. Bring it on.
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
She's from 'What a Girl Wants.'
I didn't do anything!
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
I feel weird.
You're killing him, Michael!
I just told you.
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Ooooh!
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
What did yours say?
Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
If you take it back, I'll scream.
It has almost no calories.
I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
Really?
I think I'm gonna stay here.
We have a date!
You told us we had to.
You look so pretty.
Pitiful.
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
Oh my God what song was that?
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
I'm going to have some cake.
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
I was lying.
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
Do you think I'm a slut?
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
Can I have a turkey burger?
[voice cracks] I'm so happy for you...
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
He's rubbing his neck.
Who?
For you maybe.
So you should be heading back to your desk.
Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
We're screwed.
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
Dwight: What are you doing?
[enters conference room]
Ryan, we're doing the dance!
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
...and you call me, to calm you down...
But parody is always derivative.
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
What did I say?
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
Cause it's like, really...
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
Oh, great.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
Michael, it's time.
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
You look so handsome.
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
I'm too excited to sleep.
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
Oh.
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
Dwight!
Oh it was?
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
Just reiterating what you said to me.
I don't care. They can just vote.
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
The show's back on, what happened?
I can���t get down.
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
Only three tickets.
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
Looks like salmon.
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
[bleep] me!
Having fun.
Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
Oh, my God. You scared me.
That'll work.
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
So you're dumping me?
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
Is that traffic school?
I don't want to hit the big rock!
Ryan, I changed my mind.
Damn girl! Your body!
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
Ryan?
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
Good. And the dry cleaners?
Try 'Jesus.'
Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
Think you can handle this?
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
Oh!
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
Boring.
Oh, he's also super-insecure about his height.
I...
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
Hello, Ryan.
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
What?
Why is that?
You have to stop.
Stop squirming.
Oh God. [takes off ring]
No, he's a freak.
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
Okay. [makes out with Darryl]
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
Damn it.
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
That was really cool. [they make out]
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
Give me that thing, I want to try.
Hi, Michael.
[sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww!
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
Cool.
Oh, from the insurance commercials!
That's Buddhist.
Wow.
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
Sorry?
And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
Guess whose boyfriend it is?
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
He's not saying anything!
[crying]
Like, an Indian Halloween?
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
Is that a blow torch?!
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
Who, what?
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
We're back together again baby.
Good luck Michael!
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
I thought you read these every week.
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Why would he say that?
Which time?
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
Oh, God, please stop!
Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
What? I'm not Muslim!
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
Did Michael get them for you?
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
Drake is your baby���s name?
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
Yo.
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
Oh, so I'm crazy now?
Hi David! [group hellos]
Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
You had carbs?  That's awful.
Andy, that was just the ice.
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
This point system is really insulting.
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
You always say that, and I almost never know.
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
Yeah.
Isn't that like your third soda today?
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
I wasn't going to interrupt.
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
Good. Let���s go.
Because I never forget anything.
I love your tie, Michael.
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
Are you moving back here?
What?!
But you're an accountant too.
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
Just leave me alone!
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
Ryan.
That looks, cool, where is that?
Oh my God, kill me!
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
Waaay too tight.
So, I was looking so hot...
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
Is Brad okay?
Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.
Thank you.
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
Where?
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
I don't understand what the big deal is.
You chose this job over that job?
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
But I--it's not right.
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
Did you hear something?
I was a twelve year old bully.
I don't understand.
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Jim!
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
It's a small office.
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
She's 23.
What was that?
Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.
