Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?
You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)
You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.
Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.
Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.
I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?
Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?
No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor.
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.
..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
I was going to kiss you good night.
There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
The results of your sperm test are in.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
