And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
(Lets go) Oh, sorry.
No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
That's probably what did it.
Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor.
Yeah.
I've looked at your X-rays.
Oh, exactly the same.
Those can be very refreshing.
She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
Saying what?
One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
Its my favorite toe.
Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.
No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
Ah--that's not necessarily true.
May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
Huh?
Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
It happens.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.
Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.
Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
Yes
Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
Nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms.
Excuse me , Are you the husband?
Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
No youre not.
She expired.
There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
I've examined you.
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
I was going to kiss you good night.
(Thinking to himself) "Fungicide"? Fungus?
You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.
I said, good-bye.
Oh uh, wheres the bathroom?
I'll need a urine sample.
Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
Yes , of course.
A biopsy.
We, could put him to sleep.
He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?
We have to...
Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits)
Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
Hi Roy.
Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.
Well , I'm sorry.....She's gone.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)
A-hu. (The doctor is at a loss)
All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
No, not really.
Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
First thing you should wear boxer shorts.
Which one is the son?
The results of your sperm test are in.
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
