All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
Ah--that's not necessarily true.
That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
(Thinking to himself) "Fungicide"? Fungus?
That's probably what did it.
Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
(Lets go) Oh, sorry.
Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor.
Excuse me , Are you the husband?
Yes
We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
She expired.
Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?
I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
I said, good-bye.
I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
A biopsy.
Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
We have to...
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
Yes , of course.
Which one is the son?
Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
No youre not.
Its my favorite toe.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
Well I don't know what it is.
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
No, not really.
I've examined you.
Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?
Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
I'll need a urine sample.
You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)
And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?
Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.
Saying what?
I was going to kiss you good night.
Hi Roy.
Huh?
First thing you should wear boxer shorts.
May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
It happens.
Nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms.
Well , I'm sorry.....She's gone.
Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
Oh uh, wheres the bathroom?
Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.
I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.
Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
The results of your sperm test are in.
And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
We, could put him to sleep.
You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.
From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
A-hu. (The doctor is at a loss)
I've looked at your X-rays.
I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
Oh, exactly the same.
(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
