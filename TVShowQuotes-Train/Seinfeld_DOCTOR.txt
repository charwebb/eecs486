From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?
Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.
Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits)
I was going to kiss you good night.
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?
May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?
Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.
That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.
There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
The results of your sperm test are in.
Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
