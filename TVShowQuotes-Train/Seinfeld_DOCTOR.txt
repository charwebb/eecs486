Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
I was going to kiss you good night.
All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?
Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.
We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits)
Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.
Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?
Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor.
Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
The results of your sperm test are in.
