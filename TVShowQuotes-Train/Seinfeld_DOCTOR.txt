Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.
You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)
I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor.
And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
The results of your sperm test are in.
I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits)
From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.
One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?
May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
