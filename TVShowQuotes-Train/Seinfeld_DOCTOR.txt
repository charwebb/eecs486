Ah--that's not necessarily true.
Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
No, not really.
A biopsy.
Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
Its my favorite toe.
Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.
(Thinking to himself) "Fungicide"? Fungus?
I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
Well , I'm sorry.....She's gone.
..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)
And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
It happens.
No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
I've looked at your X-rays.
(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
She expired.
Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
Saying what?
(Lets go) Oh, sorry.
Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.
Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor.
Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.
First thing you should wear boxer shorts.
That's probably what did it.
All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
Yeah.
One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits)
Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
I was going to kiss you good night.
Excuse me , Are you the husband?
Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
Hi Roy.
Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
We, could put him to sleep.
Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.
Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.
From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
We have to...
Oh uh, wheres the bathroom?
Yes
Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
I've examined you.
Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
I said, good-bye.
Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
Huh?
Yes , of course.
I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
The results of your sperm test are in.
Oh, exactly the same.
There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?
Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
What?
I'll need a urine sample.
He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?
I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?
Well I don't know what it is.
Nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms.
Those can be very refreshing.
