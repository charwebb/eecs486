She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits)
One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
I was going to kiss you good night.
Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor.
He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?
And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.
(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?
May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.
All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.
Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.
Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)
I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
