You two better watch yourselves.
It could be out of your hands Michael.
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
That's not what a hate crime is.
I agree.
I don't want it.
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
So we've got what, another 20 minutes?
Holiday wishes.
Some actress, whether shes hot.
I don't know. [They shrug and leave.]
Hey!
Something wrong, Michael?
Is this an overnight?
You don't have our attention.
Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.
No.
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
I think I did.
Can't say.
No [crosses arms], the blue team.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
Big.
I think I do.
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
It's my bio-feedback machine..
Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
Boy, I will hammer spank your rear.
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
Heh, heh, heh.
From Argentina.
Why is it so hot in here?
I'm with Pam. Chairs.
No, Michael, No. [beeping speeds up]
Michael?  A word?
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
Mailboxes, Etc.
I don't care what you call my team.
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
Liquid.
What we're doing.
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
I didn't hear a phone.
I don't know.
Oh, my god. It���s called a garbage can.
Yes, what is this about?
Are you trying to kill me?
Hmpf!
uh-huh.
There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
And me.
About time.
In January?
And it's been lonely.
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
What's he measuring?
I'm back.
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
[quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?
You said, we could bring our families.
I love Philly. Dirty town.
I will NOT. [throws ball back]
We sell better?
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
Get the damn phone.
Yep, looks that way.
Show some pride. This is crap.
Who's Carla Fern?
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
[walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword]
What is?
To the.
Ooh, bring it over.
I would die.
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
Fantastic.
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
What?
Oh, great.
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
[groans] We'll see you tomorrow.
[sighs]
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
That's right. [laughs]
Are those purchase orders signed?
[eating soft pretzel] We've all changed.
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
Where did you get these facts?
They said I should talk to you.
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
I'm listening.
All right, I'm done now.
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
They���re like the new Jim and Dwight.
Who am I supposed to be?
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.
I admire your culture's success in America.
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
A little fishy?
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
Hmm.
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
Yes...
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
[gives Phyllis a look]
Excuse me?
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
I had Mexican food.
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
I am not going to apologize to you.
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
What's a seven letter word for purse?
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
Pass.
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
Or do you only drink with your kids?
Hmm, come here much?
You lucky son of a bitch.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
It���s all gone. I didn���t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
We get to go home?
Eh...
No. Um-um.
You could feed the hungry. Us.
Uh huh.
I mean I'm learning nothing.
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
He was good.
Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.
Stanley Hudson.
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
[at the table] Oh, not again.  Melissa!
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
How ���bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
Not again...
Okay. It's called Who Would You Do?
I'm the same way with horny people.
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
It's not right.  I don't like it.
Are you out of your damn mind?
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
How did you get in my car?
Is it nice outside?
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
Super.
Pass.
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
I will not work in a roach billboard.
Michael, don't listen to them.
You want us to apologize to you?
How is that going to work?
You just ignore their carp.
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
[flashback] I'm done. Goodbye.
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
Mm, how many bedrooms?
What does that mean?
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
A sale.
I...
Mmhmm, happy birthday.
Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming.
I think it's because of my sales record.
We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.
What have we here?
Why are you calling me here at home?
Fantastic.
[flashback] Not maybe. Yes or no.
You said bring a toothbrush.
I'm on the phone.
But... why Dwight?
I am not changing the way I do my files.
Are you serious?
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
In the African-American community-
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.
It's your job.
Still behind.
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
About what?
I want my money back.
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
I'm counting on you, Michael.
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
A little bit more and I would have had it.
That is a dangerous precedent.
Is it white wine?
You said we were getting bonuses.
No, you didn���t. Sick of you and your���ooh���
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
It's collard greens.
That's right.
Would ya, would ya step back please
She's in middle school.
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
No.
This is an abomination.
[holding a crossword puzzle] Yes.
Why not just go one for the year?
This is ridiculous.
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
You can't cancel a holiday.
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
I'm... um, Catholic.
They aren't salespeople!
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
I'm going to die.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
I'm not disabled and neither are you.
Fine. How are you?
[flashback] Are you from another planet?
Money.
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
Need a hand?
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
I'm outta here.
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
It wasn't me.
Let me get back to my desk right now.
I knew it. Haha! [they high five]
Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
Yeah.
I don't like cake anymore
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
No.
When will that be?
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
I'm about to die!
More meetings and-
Okay, I need a drink.
A toaster, you?
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
What���s that?
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
There he is!
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
Last year, five years ago...
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
Chocolate.
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
You must have been scared out of your mind.
Just big.
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
I do not think that is funny.
Trust me. It only gets worse.
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
What kind of food?
Michael?
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
That's one book. You've got two others.
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
He ain���t coming.
Big.
What are you doing?
I missed you too.
I know how to plug something in.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
No, that was you.
Where's my five dollars?
Hmmm...
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
So I'm not fired.
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
Unbelievable.
No.
I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.
Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
No I didn't.
Perfect, isn't it?
That doesn't make you a boss.
I heard that.
Leave it woman!
EAT IT! [Jim begins eating black licorice]
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
I like what we have.
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
[chuckles]
Amen.
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
Ooh-hoo, look at that baby���
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
If you don't smell this, you're fired.'
Can't you see I'm urinating?
It's too little. Use the phone.
Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.
I am going back to my desk...
I usually take a siesta about now.
Yup.
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
The Kardashians is a good show.
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
How did I end up back in Crazytown?
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Now we���re talkin���.
[drinks a 5-Hour Energy shot and groans]
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
[growly noises, Jim looks terrified]
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
I'm done.
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
Why should we help you?
Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.
What about confidentiality?
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
That���s none of your damn business.
Get us out of this!
Why would this affect our bonuses?
Is he still doing his boycott?
What are you talking about?
Me too. [holds up four fingers]
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
These are all the same?
Fine.
Hello Meredith.
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
She's upstairs talking to Charles.
You find anything?
Why'd you do this?
I have.
What?!
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
Oh, sweet mother of God.
You really like her, huh?
No. Are those purchase orders signed?
Thank you, Michael.
Or him.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
There is a butterfly on this. Why?
I'm okay with the logic of it.
Is that it?
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
Can you promise that?
Pigeons.
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
I didn't say that.
Seems recent.
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
Huh? What?
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
Zero.
I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
Yes, please let us know.
[flashback] Did I stutter?
I'm going back inside.
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
Dwight.
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
Okay, um...
Why don't you mind your business?
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
I'm taking my dumplings.
Mmm! [struggles] Ugh!
[singing] Closing time every new beginning���
That's where nosey'll get you.
This is not natural.
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.
Just transfer the damn call.
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
Mm, swish.
Make it 100.
No. I want Tropical Christmas.
Not enough lobster. Side order.
Excuse me?
Are you crazy?
... I'll take the kid.
It's my birthday.
[whispers] Click the 'x'
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
You're always asking for our attention.
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
[to Toby, who's filming] You fallin' behind.
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
No, I'm done.
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
Oh, I don't know.
Can I also be a boss?
It's a bad bet.
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball.
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
Four Splenda. Are you crazy?
No.
[angry] Yeah wow!
Good news that you found our leads?
Texas justice.
Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
What?
Why can't you guys do it?
Don't talk to me.
No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
So?
You have just spit on my face.
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
Oh my God!
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
No, no, no, no.
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
I'm sorry?
Goooood bye.
Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
Hey guys.
[Stanley's fork breaks.] Of course.
Michael, are you that blind?
Co-manager of what?
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
We all think you don't have a surprise.
American Diabetes Association.
Oh, for the love of God.
I���m on break.
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
Oscar!
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Do we have to play?
Do you want us to look for 'em?
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
How did a mosquito get in here?
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
When are we getting to sales topics?
What's under the cloth?
I have an idea for your weekend.
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
Eee.
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
Oh, sure, we talk all the time.
Atlanta.
Oh, my ankle!
Oh, is today Recyclops Day?
Booyah! [laughs]
What's happening?
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
mm-hmm. [about to leave]
Can���t you just leave?
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
When is my birthday?
Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
No way.
Do not care.
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
Hmm?
Just some chef.
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
Marry me Holly.
A beautiful family.
This is Pretzel Day.
I was.
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
You've been meatballed! [laughs]
This meeting.
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
I need to know...
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
Why can't you just do regular sit-ups?
And we are grateful.
I did, my wife's name is Terri.
Hmmm. [glances at Andy] Thank you.
DID I STUTTER?
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
Has it really been ten years?
Michael.
Nope. Starts with an H.
You want the lead?
Oh, thanks.
Hmmmpt.
We'll never have to buy meatballs again.
And I think, 'there's no possible way--
No.
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
We get that every year.
Did you say 'Koi pond'?
What?
Good day.
What the hell is going on here?
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
What's that supposed to mean?
Annoying.
Do I need my jacket?
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
Is he right about that?
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
Oh my God.
That���s pizza.
Not me.
It's just that we need to know.
And what did you say?
Ninety nine cases..yeah.
Thank you. [reaches for bagel]
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
[kicks ball toward Phyllis] Now it isn't.
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.
Keep talking all you want.
No you will not.
[chuckling] What a messed up world.
Get off me!
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
Ooh.
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
[flashback] No way. Uh-uh.
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
Please. A little further.
Put that away and learn.
Who's a native?
I know, I just read it on the sign.
Goodnight.
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
Don't tell me how to do my business.
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
Excuse me.
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
Excuse me?
Somebody's always got to be a hero.
Yes.
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
I don���t know, because we���re not friends.
Hmmm...
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
[throwing ball back] Nope.
I'm out.
Are you ready for some meatball?
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
Great.
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
Did I say 'Messina?' [tires screech]
Why 'of course'?
Put those away before you hurt yourself.
Not a gun.
Uh hmmmm... .
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
We deserve to know.
Mmmm... chewy.
[in pain] Oh. Go away.
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
I'll get over it.
Money.
Woman, you've had a computer for years!
Oh my God!
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
Oh, I do.
Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders'
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
Are you giving us our clients back?
Don���t be pushy Jim. It���s tacky.
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy]
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
Hold it!
I do not know.
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
No.
Is that it?
Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
I got one queen size bed.
Leave me alone, dammit.
You brought balloons to a play?
Oh, good one. [laughs]
[insincerely] Good to be back.
Shh!
Thank you! [takes pretzel]
If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
It's fine.
