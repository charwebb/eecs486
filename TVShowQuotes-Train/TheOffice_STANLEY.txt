I admire your culture's success in America.
Don't talk to me.
How did I end up back in Crazytown?
You lucky son of a bitch.
Not maybe. Yes or no.
Uh huh.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
They���re like the new Jim and Dwight.
I had Mexican food.
Who's Carla Fern?
I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.
I think I do.
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
Who's a native?
Yup.
Way to go, Ryan!
What are you talking about?
Zero.
[chuckles]
Michael?  A word?
[singing] Closing time every new beginning���
I don't know. [They shrug and leave.]
Okay, um...
Ooh-hoo, look at that baby���
It's all about my bonus.
I didn't say that.
What have we here?
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
You ran over an employee.
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
Now we���re talkin���.
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
It's collard greens.
And I think, 'there's no possible way--
Mmhmm. What?
Why should we help you?
It's collard greens.
I don't like cake anymore
We all think you don't have a surprise.
No.
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
That's ok.
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
No.
This meeting.
Mm, how many bedrooms?
Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.
Oh, I do.
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
Big.
We deserve to know.
Is that it?
Money.
I'm outta here.
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
I do not think that is funny.
I'm listening.
Shuckin��� your peas.
Hold it!
[at the table] Oh, not again.  Melissa!
Fine.
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
He was good.
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
Thank you! [takes pretzel]
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
Is it nice outside?
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
What���s that?
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
Perfect, isn't it?
Aw, let him do it.
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
I'm okay with the logic of it.
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
No. Are those purchase orders signed?
It wasn't me.
[walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword]
About time.
Good news that you found our leads?
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
Excuse me.
Do we have to play?
I don���t know, because we���re not friends.
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
Oh, good one. [laughs]
Last year, five years ago...
Annoying.
Get the damn phone.
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
I'm not disabled and neither are you.
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
Not me.
Yes.
Ooh, bring it over.
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
[whispers] Click the 'x'
Do I need my jacket?
Not your staff, Michael. You.
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
And me.
[sighs]
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.
Michael.
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
Not enough lobster. Side order.
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
Are those purchase orders signed?
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
Has it really been ten years?
I have an idea for your weekend.
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
New File System'.
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
Goodbye. [walks away]
Goodnight.
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
No way.
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.
[groans] We'll see you tomorrow.
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
I don't know.
Texas justice.
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
I didn't hear a phone.
We sell better?
I like what we have.
[chuckling] What a messed up world.
Why are you calling me here at home?
Why'd you do this?
Four Splenda. Are you crazy?
Is it white wine?
Shh!
I was.
I'm sorry?
[insincerely] Good to be back.
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
That is a dangerous precedent.
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball.
I think I did.
I'm... um, Catholic.
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
They said I should talk to you.
Yes, what is this about?
That's right.
Hmmm. [glances at Andy] Thank you.
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
How ���bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
Michael, don't listen to them.
Get off me!
I heard that.
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
Money.
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
Hello Meredith.
Ooh.
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
I'm the same way with horny people.
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
There he is!
If you don't smell this, you're fired.'
What is?
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
Oh, actually no I don't Michael.
Atlanta.
[flashback] Are you from another planet?
I'm taking my dumplings.
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
Me too. [holds up four fingers]
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
Liquid.
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
What kind of food?
Do not care.
[drinks a 5-Hour Energy shot and groans]
That's where nosey'll get you.
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
Hmmm...
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming.
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
That's not what a hate crime is.
Oscar!
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
I mean I'm learning nothing.
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
Cancel wallpaper.
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
What does that mean?
It's just that we need to know.
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
You really like her, huh?
When is my birthday?
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
I do not know.
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
It's not right.  I don't like it.
Why is it so hot in here?
No, that was you.
That���s none of your damn business.
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
We all saw you do it.
In January?
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
No I didn't.
Yes, please let us know.
We sit close.
Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
I'm in. [sits back down]
You just ignore their carp.
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
Who let this boy on the phone?
Fantastic.
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
They aren't salespeople!
Amen.
Excuse me?
Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
Oh, sweet mother of God.
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
Make it 100.
DID I STUTTER?
I will NOT. [throws ball back]
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
A toaster, you?
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
Marry me Holly.
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
A sale.
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
[flashback] Did I stutter?
Are you ready for some meatball?
Holiday wishes.
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
[to Toby, who's filming] You fallin' behind.
This is an abomination.
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
Why don't you mind your business?
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.
You must have been scared out of your mind.
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
Don't tell me how to do my business.
Why can't you just do regular sit-ups?
[growly noises, Jim looks terrified]
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
Leave it woman!
It could be out of your hands Michael.
No, no, no, no.
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
No.
No, you didn���t. Sick of you and your���ooh���
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
Leave me alone, dammit.
No.
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
Can't you see I'm urinating?
Uh hmmmm... .
Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.
[throwing ball back] Nope.
But... why Dwight?
You can't cancel a holiday.
Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.
Oh, I don't know.
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
Hmm, come here much?
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
This is ridiculous.
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
These are all the same?
Excuse me?
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
Oh, is today Recyclops Day?
What?
What are you doing?
Let me get back to my desk right now.
That doesn't make you a boss.
Michael, are you that blind?
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
Are you out of your damn mind?
There was a car.
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.
Pass.
Big.
I am not changing the way I do my files.
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
Hmmmpt.
Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.
Show some pride. This is crap.
Michael?
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
What's a seven letter word for purse?
Oh, great.
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
Mmhmm, happy birthday.
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
She's in middle school.
What?
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.
I know, I just read it on the sign.
You have just spit on my face.
Yeah.
Some actress, whether shes hot.
You don't have our attention.
Or him.
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
No.
I don't care.
You want us to apologize to you?
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
It's your job.
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
I would die.
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
Are you serious?
I'll get over it.
In the box.
Where's my five dollars?
That���s Benji. Oh, he���s precious. That���s a healthy-looking baby.
We do not wanna hear about this.
Pigeons.
I will not work in a roach billboard.
There is a butterfly on this. Why?
Thank you, Michael.
It's too little. Use the phone.
Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
A little fishy?
No, I'm done.
I'm going back inside.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
Hmpf!
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
How did a mosquito get in here?
[holding a crossword puzzle] Yes.
So?
Stanley Hudson.
Hmm.
I know how to plug something in.
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
All right, I'm done now.
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
Or do you only drink with your kids?
Are you trying to kill me?
[quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
Do you want us to look for 'em?
When will that be?
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
What?!
Fruity and delicious.
Can���t you just leave?
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.
Why 'of course'?
I am not going to apologize to you.
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
When are we getting to sales topics?
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders'
No. I want Tropical Christmas.
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
Something wrong, Michael?
Is that supposed to be me?
I'm on the phone.
Can I also be a boss?
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
I knew it. Haha! [they high five]
I'm out.
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
Why can't you guys do it?
Need a hand?
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
I'm with Pam. Chairs.
Not again...
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
Ninety nine cases..yeah.
Hmm?
Seems recent.
Hmmm...
[on phone] There are a hundred packs..
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Yep, looks that way.
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
[flashback] No way. Uh-uh.
Why not just go one for the year?
No. Um-um.
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
I'm done.
I agree.
Still behind.
Oh my God!
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
What about confidentiality?
So we've got what, another 20 minutes?
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
Hmm?
And it's been lonely.
... I'll take the kid.
Mmmm... chewy.
Booyah! [laughs]
Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
This is not natural.
I did, my wife's name is Terri.
Mmhmmm.
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
I'm back.
Would ya, would ya step back please
Nope. Starts with an H.
He can top that.'
No I'm not.
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
Pass.
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
You said bring a toothbrush.
Boy, I will hammer spank your rear.
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
You said, we could bring our families.
No.
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
Hey guys.
No.
Mmm! [struggles] Ugh!
Night, everybody.
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
Just transfer the damn call.
Just some chef.
Ohhh���
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
What we're doing.
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
I'm counting on you, Michael.
Mm, swish.
It's fine.
Thank you. [reaches for bagel]
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
Oh my God!
We get that every year.
They are not.
Goooood bye.
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
I don't want it.
Helllloooo!
Put that away and learn.
Are you giving us our clients back?
And what did you say?
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
I have.
No [crosses arms], the blue team.
I���m on break.
Did you say 'Koi pond'?
It���s all gone. I didn���t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
You've been meatballed! [laughs]
More meetings and-
That���s pizza.
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
Just big.
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
[eating soft pretzel] We've all changed.
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
I think it's because of my sales record.
Woman, you've had a computer for years!
[gives Phyllis a look]
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
About what?
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
Hi, Michael.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Can't say.
Fine. How are you?
This is Pretzel Day.
[murmurs] Thought it was worth a try.
You said we were getting bonuses.
Dwight.
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
You want the lead?
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
Is he right about that?
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
uh-huh.
I...
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
Can you promise that?
Is he still doing his boycott?
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
[angry] Yeah wow!
I don't care what you call my team.
No, Michael, No. [beeping speeds up]
mm-hmm. [about to leave]
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
The flirtatious tickling.
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
What's under the cloth?
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
Are you crazy?
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
So I'm not fired.
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
She's upstairs talking to Charles.
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
Yes...
You're always asking for our attention.
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
Super.
I missed you too.
Unbelievable.
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
Look for your stapler!
No you will not.
Good day.
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
Is this an overnight?
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
The Kardashians is a good show.
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
You could feed the hungry. Us.
[Stanley's fork breaks.] Of course.
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
Why would this affect our bonuses?
What's happening?
[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
Excuse me?
EAT IT! [Jim begins eating black licorice]
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
Oh my God.
From Argentina.
Try mose1234.
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
And we are grateful.
Next stop pies! [group joins in]
We'll never have to buy meatballs again.
It's my birthday.
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
Somebody's always got to be a hero.
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
That's one book. You've got two others.
What's he measuring?
Did I say 'Messina?' [tires screech]
A beautiful family.
Okay, I need a drink.
I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
Don���t be pushy Jim. It���s tacky.
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
I got one queen size bed.
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
Put those away before you hurt yourself.
We get to go home?
What.
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
Chocolate.
Fantastic.
Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
American Diabetes Association.
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
[flashback] I'm done. Goodbye.
I need to know...
Who am I supposed to be?
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
To the.
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
Eee.
Huh? What?
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, my god. It���s called a garbage can.
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
I'm about to die!
I am going back to my desk...
[kicks ball toward Phyllis] Now it isn't.
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
It's my bio-feedback machine..
I want my money back.
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
