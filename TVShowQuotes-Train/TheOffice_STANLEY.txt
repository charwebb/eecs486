Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
Do you want us to look for 'em?
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
It could be out of your hands Michael.
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
Don't tell me how to do my business.
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Why not just go one for the year?
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
Let me get back to my desk right now.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
I don't care what you call my team.
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
A little bit more and I would have had it.
Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
No, you didn���t. Sick of you and your���ooh���
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
You must have been scared out of your mind.
I am not changing the way I do my files.
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
I am not going to apologize to you.
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
It���s all gone. I didn���t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
That���s Benji. Oh, he���s precious. That���s a healthy-looking baby.
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball.
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
I think it's because of my sales record.
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
I know, I just read it on the sign.
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
Why are you calling me here at home?
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders'
If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
