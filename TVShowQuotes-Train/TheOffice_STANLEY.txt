I will not work in a roach billboard.
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
Oh, my god. It���s called a garbage can.
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
Do you want us to look for 'em?
Don't tell me how to do my business.
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
I know, I just read it on the sign.
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
Why are you calling me here at home?
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
Why not just go one for the year?
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
It���s all gone. I didn���t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
I think it's because of my sales record.
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
I am not changing the way I do my files.
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
I don't care what you call my team.
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
It could be out of your hands Michael.
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball.
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
How ���bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
You must have been scared out of your mind.
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
That���s Benji. Oh, he���s precious. That���s a healthy-looking baby.
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
How did I end up back in Crazytown?
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
Let me get back to my desk right now.
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
We all think you don't have a surprise.
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
Or do you only drink with your kids?
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
A little bit more and I would have had it.
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
