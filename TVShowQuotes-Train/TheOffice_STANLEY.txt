[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
I know, I just read it on the sign.
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
I am not going to apologize to you.
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
How did I end up back in Crazytown?
Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
How ���bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
You must have been scared out of your mind.
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
Why are you calling me here at home?
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
Oh, my god. It���s called a garbage can.
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
I will not work in a roach billboard.
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
I think it's because of my sales record.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
We all think you don't have a surprise.
I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders'
I don't care what you call my team.
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
I am not changing the way I do my files.
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
Do you want us to look for 'em?
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
It could be out of your hands Michael.
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
