Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
Are you crazy?
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming.
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy]
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
Are you serious?
Why would this affect our bonuses?
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
Is he right about that?
I do not know.
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
No. I want Tropical Christmas.
Eee.
You two better watch yourselves.
What are you talking about?
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
I am going back to my desk...
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
I am not going to apologize to you.
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
I'll get over it.
You have just spit on my face.
[kicks ball toward Phyllis] Now it isn't.
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
It's my bio-feedback machine..
Yes, what is this about?
Shh!
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
Is that it?
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
It's my birthday.
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
I'm counting on you, Michael.
A little fishy?
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
Zero.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
Chocolate.
Four Splenda. Are you crazy?
Don't tell me how to do my business.
No.
Somebody's always got to be a hero.
Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
Hold it!
This is ridiculous.
More meetings and-
Try mose1234.
I heard that.
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
Is it white wine?
I think I did.
That's ok.
It's a bad bet.
[groans] We'll see you tomorrow.
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
[singing] Closing time every new beginning���
mm-hmm. [about to leave]
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
Not maybe. Yes or no.
Uh huh.
Pass.
She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
Okay, um...
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
[holding a crossword puzzle] Yes.
Are you trying to kill me?
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
I didn't say that.
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
Mmhmm, happy birthday.
A little bit more and I would have had it.
Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
She's in middle school.
Hmm?
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
Are you ready for some meatball?
This is an abomination.
Oh, for the love of God.
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
I do not think that is funny.
What the hell is going on here?
It's your job.
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
That's where nosey'll get you.
Excuse me?
I knew it. Haha! [they high five]
No question.
[flashback] Are you from another planet?
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
A sale.
Why 'of course'?
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
Let me get back to my desk right now.
I'm the same way with horny people.
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
Do we have to play?
There is a butterfly on this. Why?
And I think, 'there's no possible way--
That's right. [laughs]
Or him.
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
Who let this boy on the phone?
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
The Kardashians is a good show.
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
Why can't you just do regular sit-ups?
I'm going to die.
Ohhh���
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
What.
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
Still behind.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
Money.
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
I don't care.
Yes.
That is a dangerous precedent.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
Who am I supposed to be?
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
Oh my God!
Hmmm...
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
Oh my God!
No, no, no, no.
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
I missed you too.
Need a hand?
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
Oh, I do.
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
Excuse me?
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
DID I STUTTER?
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
Super.
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Michael?
Not enough lobster. Side order.
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
You said bring a toothbrush.
[to Toby, who's filming] You fallin' behind.
You could feed the hungry. Us.
I'm with Pam. Chairs.
Why'd you do this?
Is this an overnight?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
No, Michael, No. [beeping speeds up]
From Argentina.
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
That���s pizza.
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
You brought balloons to a play?
And what did you say?
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
I think it's because of my sales record.
Hmm?
Oh, good one. [laughs]
Big.
Holiday wishes.
I don't know. [They shrug and leave.]
Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
There was a car.
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
What is?
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
In the box.
Do not care.
Is he still doing his boycott?
Cancel wallpaper.
Is that it?
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
This is Pretzel Day.
Michael?  A word?
What's a seven letter word for purse?
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
Get the damn phone.
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
What?
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
Fruity and delicious.
But... why Dwight?
I am not changing the way I do my files.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
In January?
How is that going to work?
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
A beautiful family.
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
If you don't smell this, you're fired.'
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
How did you get in my car?
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
You can't cancel a holiday.
Now we���re talkin���.
Put that away and learn.
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
How ���bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
I'm outta here.
You find anything?
All right, I'm done now.
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
No [crosses arms], the blue team.
I will not work in a roach billboard.
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
[flashback] No way. Uh-uh.
Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.
I mean I'm learning nothing.
I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.
When is my birthday?
These are all the same?
You must have been scared out of your mind.
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Who's a native?
I had Mexican food.
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.
I love Philly. Dirty town.
Mmhmmm.
[flashback] Did I stutter?
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
Money.
I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.
[walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword]
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
Fantastic.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
It's not right.  I don't like it.
I will NOT. [throws ball back]
Has it really been ten years?
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
[on phone] There are a hundred packs..
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
What?!
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
I like what we have.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
It could be out of your hands Michael.
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
Good news that you found our leads?
What have we here?
They are not.
Why not just go one for the year?
So I'm not fired.
Amen.
Mmm! [struggles] Ugh!
No. Um-um.
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
No.
That's right.
[insincerely] Good to be back.
[chuckles]
Hey!
Can I also be a boss?
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
We all think you don't have a surprise.
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
Oscar!
No.
Hmm.
Not me.
Would ya, would ya step back please
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
A toaster, you?
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
[Stanley's fork breaks.] Of course.
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
EAT IT! [Jim begins eating black licorice]
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
No you will not.
[throwing ball back] Nope.
They���re like the new Jim and Dwight.
He was good.
I would die.
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
Goooood bye.
Hmmm. [glances at Andy] Thank you.
They aren't salespeople!
What���s that?
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
Can't say.
Hey guys.
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
Some actress, whether shes hot.
Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
Atlanta.
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
I didn't hear a phone.
What's he measuring?
No, you didn���t. Sick of you and your���ooh���
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
No.
Pass.
What kind of food?
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
I admire your culture's success in America.
Why are you calling me here at home?
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
It wasn't me.
I have an idea for your weekend.
We get that every year.
Yeah.
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
[in pain] Oh. Go away.
To the.
Excuse me.
Do I need my jacket?
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
Not again...
Ooh-hoo, look at that baby���
I'm back.
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
Something wrong, Michael?
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
... I'll take the kid.
When are we getting to sales topics?
You want the lead?
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
We sit close.
Keep talking all you want.
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
Marry me Holly.
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
You just ignore their carp.
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
You don't have our attention.
Mailboxes, Etc.
Ninety nine cases..yeah.
Big.
We sell better?
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
Me too. [holds up four fingers]
It's too little. Use the phone.
Ooh.
Get off me!
Not your staff, Michael. You.
Heh, heh, heh.
Michael, don't listen to them.
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
Oh my God.
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
Way to go, Ryan!
I���m on break.
Hmmmpt.
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
Why should we help you?
Show some pride. This is crap.
Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.
We deserve to know.
Okay, I need a drink.
I'm listening.
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
Michael.
Mmmm... chewy.
Oh, I don't know.
I'm taking my dumplings.
Trust me. It only gets worse.
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.
No. Are those purchase orders signed?
Mmhmm. What?
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
Shuckin��� your peas.
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
[eating soft pretzel] We've all changed.
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.
Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.
I...
Hmpf!
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Fine. How are you?
[gives Phyllis a look]
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
We'll never have to buy meatballs again.
Hi, Michael.
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
Where did you get these facts?
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
What's happening?
[at the table] Oh, not again.  Melissa!
It's collard greens.
Oh, sure, we talk all the time.
That���s none of your damn business.
No way.
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
That doesn't make you a boss.
Is that supposed to be me?
Did you say 'Koi pond'?
I'm on the phone.
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
No, I'm done.
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
What we're doing.
Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
Goodbye. [walks away]
No, that was you.
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
I want my money back.
I need to know...
Annoying.
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
Are those purchase orders signed?
Yep, looks that way.
Aw, let him do it.
That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
I don't know.
Just transfer the damn call.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
Co-manager of what?
I'm okay with the logic of it.
Are you giving us our clients back?
You ran over an employee.
[sighs]
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.
What's under the cloth?
She's upstairs talking to Charles.
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
Liquid.
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
Why can't you guys do it?
I'm done.
What about confidentiality?
What does that mean?
I'm about to die!
No.
Or do you only drink with your kids?
No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
Unbelievable.
It���s all gone. I didn���t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
[murmurs] Thought it was worth a try.
Oh, thanks.
[flashback] I'm done. Goodbye.
Uh hmmmm... .
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
Woman, you've had a computer for years!
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
I did, my wife's name is Terri.
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball.
I don't like cake anymore
Please. A little further.
Excuse me?
Can you promise that?
I usually take a siesta about now.
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
Yup.
In the African-American community-
It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
We do not wanna hear about this.
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
No I'm not.
It's fine.
How did I end up back in Crazytown?
You lucky son of a bitch.
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
Hmmm...
I don't want it.
When will that be?
I have.
Fair enough.
Not a gun.
Pigeons.
I'm going back inside.
I don���t know, because we���re not friends.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
I'm out.
Fantastic.
I'm... um, Catholic.
[whispers] Click the 'x'
uh-huh.
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Just some chef.
[quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
Seems recent.
I was.
Who's Carla Fern?
Do you want us to look for 'em?
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
It's collard greens.
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
We all saw you do it.
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
Just big.
How did a mosquito get in here?
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
They said I should talk to you.
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
This meeting.
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
I'm sorry?
Oh, my ankle!
Can't you see I'm urinating?
I think I do.
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
Texas justice.
Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.
Yes...
Leave it woman!
I know how to plug something in.
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
New File System'.
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
Goodnight.
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
He ain���t coming.
American Diabetes Association.
Nope. Starts with an H.
I'm in. [sits back down]
Can���t you just leave?
Make it 100.
Why don't you mind your business?
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
No.
Huh? What?
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
There he is!
I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
Stanley Hudson.
That's one book. You've got two others.
Put those away before you hurt yourself.
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
No I didn't.
You're always asking for our attention.
Did I say 'Messina?' [tires screech]
It's just that we need to know.
The flirtatious tickling.
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
Mm, swish.
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
No.
You've been meatballed! [laughs]
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
Don't talk to me.
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
[drinks a 5-Hour Energy shot and groans]
We get to go home?
Dwight.
I'm not disabled and neither are you.
I don't care what you call my team.
[growly noises, Jim looks terrified]
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
I know, I just read it on the sign.
Boy, I will hammer spank your rear.
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Hmm, come here much?
I got one queen size bed.
Booyah! [laughs]
What?
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
Hello Meredith.
He can top that.'
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
Thank you! [takes pretzel]
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
Where's my five dollars?
It's all about my bonus.
Last year, five years ago...
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
About time.
Okay. It's called Who Would You Do?
And it's been lonely.
Oh, my god. It���s called a garbage can.
This is not natural.
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
So we've got what, another 20 minutes?
