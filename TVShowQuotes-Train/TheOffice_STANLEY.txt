I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
Let me get back to my desk right now.
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
Do you want us to look for 'em?
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
I don't care what you call my team.
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
I think it's because of my sales record.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
I am not changing the way I do my files.
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
A little bit more and I would have had it.
Why are you calling me here at home?
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
Oh, my god. It���s called a garbage can.
Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.
How did I end up back in Crazytown?
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
We all think you don't have a surprise.
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
That���s Benji. Oh, he���s precious. That���s a healthy-looking baby.
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders'
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
I am not going to apologize to you.
We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
Don't tell me how to do my business.
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
I know, I just read it on the sign.
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball.
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
How ���bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
It���s all gone. I didn���t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
Why not just go one for the year?
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
You must have been scared out of your mind.
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
It could be out of your hands Michael.
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
