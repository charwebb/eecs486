We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
It���s all gone. I didn���t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
How ���bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
That���s Benji. Oh, he���s precious. That���s a healthy-looking baby.
Or do you only drink with your kids?
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
Don't tell me how to do my business.
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
I will not work in a roach billboard.
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
Why not just go one for the year?
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
I am not going to apologize to you.
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
I think it's because of my sales record.
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
Let me get back to my desk right now.
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
How did I end up back in Crazytown?
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
No, you didn���t. Sick of you and your���ooh���
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball.
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
I know, I just read it on the sign.
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
Why are you calling me here at home?
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
A little bit more and I would have had it.
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
I don't care what you call my team.
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
Oh, my god. It���s called a garbage can.
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
I am not changing the way I do my files.
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders'
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
You must have been scared out of your mind.
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
We all think you don't have a surprise.
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
