Oh, oh very good choice. Very good.
So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels were in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here.
Yes, yes, they give me job thanks to you.
You had my Visa application?!
You see how I listen. I work very hard, borrow more money.
The wheels are in motion?
No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man!
