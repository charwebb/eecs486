Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk.
Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer?
Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity.
Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?
We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing?
Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S.
It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.
But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to be an employee of South Park Milk,  which to date has found over a hundred thousand missing kids, and, led the way in the fight against curdling. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, your son grew up not knowing who his parents were.  But he was strong and resilient,  and ended up becoming very successful. I think it will amaze you as it will all of us to learn that your son... is Ben Affleck! 
Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years.
Scan databanks for children who reported their parents missing.
