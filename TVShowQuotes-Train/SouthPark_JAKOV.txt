Hello, son. How was your day?

Ready.

Awww, did I lose?

But what about our clothes? Shouldn't we pack first?

What?

I am?

O-kay. I like South Park best of all. We're staying!

I don't know!

Turkey sandwich!

No, in the boss's lap. 

Well, all right, then. 

What?

Thank you!

Cool beans!! 

You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.

Hooray!

Me, Jun and the family are heading to the Promised Land of Memphis.

No, it's my fault. I'm sorry.

It would?

Great, Eric! We're moving.

I don't know. I like South Park a lot. What do you think, honey?

Memphis?

Yeah.

You're a nut! Let me see that letter.  It's from a game show. The Mayor has invited me to compete. 

I do? 

Ooohh.

What? You mean MTV played a video that wasn't Will Smith? 

Sorry.

Okay, we'll move to Memphis!

Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond. 

Cool beans.  Oopsie. I'll be right back. 

You guys know what?  This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit-

Junjun!

Woo, woo! 

Sure! If a free trip is involved, can my whole family go?

Huhello, guys. I love new friends. 

Forty-seven! 

Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay! 

I don't know what to do!

What??

Now I can be like all the other guys in South Park!

Sure. You got money?

Hi, Eric! Okay, bye, then! 

Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!

Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys!

I have seamen? Where's their boat?  Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr! 

Sor-ry!

Werrr. 

Hi, honey! I'm home!  Wooooo!  Boy, it was rough at work today. I've never seen so much coffee.

Oooops!

That's called a mailman. He takes care of mail.
