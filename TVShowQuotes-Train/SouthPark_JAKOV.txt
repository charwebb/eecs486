I don't know!

Werrr. 

Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond. 

But what about our clothes? Shouldn't we pack first?

You're a nut! Let me see that letter.  It's from a game show. The Mayor has invited me to compete. 

O-kay. I like South Park best of all. We're staying!

Sorry.

I don't know. I like South Park a lot. What do you think, honey?

What?

Go Niners! Ni-ners!

What? You mean MTV played a video that wasn't Will Smith? 

You guys know what?  This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit-

Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay! 

Me, Jun and the family are heading to the Promised Land of Memphis.

I do? 

Hi, honey! I'm home!  Wooooo!  Boy, it was rough at work today. I've never seen so much coffee.

Hi, Eric! Okay, bye, then! 

You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.
