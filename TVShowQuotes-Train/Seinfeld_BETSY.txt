There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility.
George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in, her getting paroled.
Does she have any plans after she's released?
And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.
George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. (Timmy smiles thinly.) This is my boyfriend, George.
Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.
So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. (George, on the couch behind Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs, and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.)
Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, I always try to sit to the right of people.
George, please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god!
Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!
