Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!
Hi.
Did you think I was Chinese?...
I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.
Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) I'm Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before.
Thanks again for the movie.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Yeah.
Thats the point.
You dont have to leave.
He told you about that?
Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.
Ridiculous.
(to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.
No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.
(pause) George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
Im Donna.
Unless you want to go to your place.
I dont like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.
Hi.
It's Donna Chang.
No it's not. (the coat)
No one is telling you to like it.
I dont wanna hear it.
Dont bother, Im leaving.
Values are very important.
...No.
You must be Estelle.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
She was trying to call you, but--
I'm Donna Chang!
Never?
Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone)
Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...
You told him how I like the commercial.
Is there anything else about you I should know?
Are those Cotton Dockers?
Really?
Yeah, its clever.
Thats Irish.
Yeah, thats the one.
(annoyed) Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants.
I'm from Long Island.
She said you should come too.
(to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
I mean I'm Donna Chang.
Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends.
Jerry.
I'm sorry...?
Yes.
Thats amazing.
No, what are you talking about.
Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it
Wait, wait. Hes in the bathroom.
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
I'm Donna Chang...
