You must be Estelle.
I dont like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.
Never?
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Thursdays great.
Yeah, its clever.
Thanks again for the movie.
Helllo...
Is there anything else about you I should know?
I mean I'm Donna Chang.
I'm sorry...?
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!
Unless you want to go to your place.
Id invite you up, but the place is being painted.
Hi.
You dont have to leave.
It's Donna Chang.
She was trying to call you, but--
Hi.
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!
I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.
(to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.
Ridiculous.
Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it
Yes.
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
(annoyed) Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants.
Jerry.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
I dont know. I like the, guys.
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
No, what are you talking about.
...No.
Yeah.
Wait, wait. Hes in the bathroom.
Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.
Used to be "Changstein."
Values are very important.
I'm Donna Chang!
(pause) George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Did you think I was Chinese?...
Really?
Im Donna.
Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) I'm Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before.
She said you should come too.
He told you about that?
I'm from Long Island.
No it's not. (the coat)
Thats Irish.
Really? I like that commercial.
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...
No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.
(to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.
Are those Cotton Dockers?
Thats the point.
Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends.
I'm Donna Chang...
Yeah, thats the one.
