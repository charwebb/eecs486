Unless you want to go to your place.
You told him how I like the commercial.
Yeah.
Dont bother, Im leaving.
Yeah, thats the one.
Are those Cotton Dockers?
Really?
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
He told you about that?
I dont like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Wait, wait. Hes in the bathroom.
Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone)
Thats Irish.
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!
Id invite you up, but the place is being painted.
Never?
It's Donna Chang.
Im Donna.
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!
Values are very important.
Hi.
Jerry.
Thanks again for the movie.
I'm Donna Chang!
Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it
Used to be "Changstein."
No, what are you talking about.
You dont have to leave.
She was trying to call you, but--
Helllo...
Thats amazing.
She said you should come too.
...No.
I'm from Long Island.
I dont know. I like the, guys.
Really? I like that commercial.
(to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.
Thats the point.
Ridiculous.
I'm Donna Chang...
Did you think I was Chinese?...
Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) I'm Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before.
No one is telling you to like it.
I'm sorry...?
I dont wanna hear it.
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
(pause) George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.
No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.
(to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.
I mean I'm Donna Chang.
Yes.
Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends.
I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.
Hi.
(annoyed) Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants.
Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...
