(to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.
Unless you want to go to your place.
Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.
(pause) George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
(to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.
No one is telling you to like it.
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!
(annoyed) Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants.
You told him how I like the commercial.
Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) I'm Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before.
No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.
Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends.
Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it
Is there anything else about you I should know?
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!
Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone)
Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...
Id invite you up, but the place is being painted.
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
