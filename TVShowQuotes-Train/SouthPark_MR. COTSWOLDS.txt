Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling! 
I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!
Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel. 
Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.
Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?
Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!
Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe! 
Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers. 
Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close! 
Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!
Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments.  My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy. 
Mark. You're absolutely right.  Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school.
I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school.
No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers.
Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better.  And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop.
Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now.
Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise.
Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it.
