Yeess.

No. No, this can't happen! No! 

DON'T YOU HI MOM AND DAD US YOU LITTLE PUNK!!! "(Punch)"

Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski.

Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks.

Aw, go to hell, you griefer!

I can't go on! Feel so... hot.

Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.

That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.

All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it.

All right, damn you! The children can come in!

That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!

You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. 

You're a grounded old bear.

Who are you?

Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!

Linda? Linda, please come downstairs.

Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!

I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation.

Oh my gosh! Linda!

What are you, Peterson? A gay fish? 

No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.

Yes? What is it, officer?

AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!

Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!

Butters is our son. He's not for sale.

Butters!

Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?

Butters! What are you doing?!

How?

And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!

That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start? 

There's something over there!

You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-

What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!

Shoot it! 

It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!

There, you see? It's right there. 

Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys.

You know that's not allowed!

Get out! You're not safe!

Yeah. We figure that if our boys are goona be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too.

I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.

Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination.

Jacking it? Jacking what?

Girlfriend?

It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he is grounded.  And no bouncing the racquetball either!

That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.

Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!

Hello Matt

And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere.

What is it, dear?

Bring him back? W-What are you talking about?

What was the show about?

Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?

Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night.

I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you.

Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!

If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby.

Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  One! Two!  Uhh, Bu-Butters?

...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?

Well well well! I had to see it to believe it! 

Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!

YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH NOW?! ANSWER ME!!! 

Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts.

Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?

Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.

Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?

Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I!

John Lennon's dead, Butters.

Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.

Well how gay is he?

It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!

Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!

That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?

Alright, you can take the paper bag off.

Go go go go back the other way! 

Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore.

WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?!

Indian... Burial Ground?

Thank you so much for taking him in.

And that's your excuse?!

Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk.

Oh, hey Randy.

You should have never come to our town! 

No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?

No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.

I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.

There! Look!  It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.

Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.

Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.

Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila.

Yes, us, the rest of the family.

Yes, it must feed.

Just let me sign.  All right, he's coming to you.

Butters?

Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here.

But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!

We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son! 

Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! 

We can't just leave them out there.

What happened?

You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay.

Just follow me to the basement.

I swear I didn't fly it.

No. I've I've got to tell him!  Butter? Butters! 

You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in.  I'm telling you Gerald, havin' a Handicar is a grat way to make some money on the side. 

You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!

Oh butter! Oh Butters, I miss you so much! 

Inside.  I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news.  Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?

O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago. 

Oh, shut up!

So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels.

Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. 

Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money?

You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!

I knew they'd come back for us!

Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son! 

Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine.

Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea.

Aaagh! Get it off of me!

Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!

Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive.  We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King. 

Well you're getting it now!

Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.

No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up.

Hey. Hey that's right.

It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead.

Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!

Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton.

There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!

Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend.

He's stopping at another house. 

OH YOU'RE GONNA GET IT MISTER! Just Wait until I get home!

This is all your fault, Jimbo!

There you are, Butters!

I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore!

Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now.

Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!

All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay.

Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!

What are your friends doing here?!

We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said "No more!" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away. 

Butters! What have you done?!

Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork.  What's the matter, Butters?

Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!

Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.

Butters started an Asian turf war!

All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah!

Look, I I need we need to find a way out under the city.

Get off the roof! 

You can go outside and play, son.

We'll talk about that when you're older!

Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!

I know that! What do you-?

What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?

Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way.

We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him!

A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.

Yes, I'd like to return this drone. 

Here we are, everyone. 

Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib.

Butters, play!  Start playing right now, young man! 

Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?

Well, speak of the devil.

Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!

How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!

Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it.

Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo!

Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!

Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?

You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.

Butters, are you home??

Timmy!

Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend?  Sally Darson?

It's him.

We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.

I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?

All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!

Who's seeing dead people?

Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.

Butters, what is going on?!

Here you go, son. Eat!

Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.

There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?! 

Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!

You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!

Butters?

Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see.

Jesus.

Oh, well, too bad.  Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her.

The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald.

No, no, wait a minute,  that's ridiculous.  What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see?  If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it. 

...Same thing.

Well Dr. Janus?

I think it's best we try to reason with it.

Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct.

Butters, what is wrong with you??

Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.

Butters! Butters!!  BUTTERRRRS!

Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.

Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?

Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!

Put that bag back on!

Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!

Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises. 

What can I do, Father?

So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!

I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!

This isn't happening!

That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.

Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!

I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.

Son of a bitch, it's him all right!

Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.

Hooray for Gerald! 

O-all right!

I, don't know.

Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!

No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over.

Really amazing.

So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.

Now, honey, we were trying to read. 

Your teacher's penis?

Go up to your room, now! 

I've never heard of one that big.

I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell.

Don't talk back to me! 

Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?

Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.

What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!

Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now!

No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him.

Oh God the medication isn't working!

Huh?

It's still here, ih... it's all still here.

Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!

Come on. Don't watch it eat. 

Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about.

Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.

What?!

It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. 

Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth.

You're back. You're back-he's back!  I love you son!

A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.

Your friends wanted to see you, Butters.

I'll get it. 

Can you believe it?

What?

Butters?! Who is that?!

Randy. We need to talk.

Your girlfriend?

What's he done now?!

Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office.

What?!

Oh my God! These people don't even know!  Hurry! You gotta go!

Well? Any luck?

They're... they're leading them away!

Everyone into the community center! Hurry! Go!

What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son.

Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!

Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing.

Now darling, calm down.

Why are they turning?

You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!

You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked.  The battery was half empty.

Well you know somethin'? So do I. 

Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?

Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you.

What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing? 

Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?

Ask her what's happening.

What are you talkin' about?

Hurry! You gotta go!

Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!

Butters? 

Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.

Yes, we found that in his pocket. 

Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?

Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister! 

Butters?!

Butters, you are grounded!

I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family.

Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son. 

Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life.

Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??

Butters?

I'll never give up!  I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!

You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.

Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again.  There he is. There's my boy! Come on, Butters!  Oh... Butters... you smell like... bacon  Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back!

Oh no, mister! You are GROUNDED! 

Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.

I'm just checking in on you, Butters.  Heh- Do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded!

I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect.  What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet. 

Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!

Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!

Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... 

Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us.

Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called "hapahui apahoha", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.  Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you. 

Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What what did he do?

It's because he is.  His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place.

The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.

Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!

Now do you believe us, Butters?

Oh yes, thank you for coming.

Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! 

Download the app! It works great! 

Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!

I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!

That's right!  If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!

Oh God look!

It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me.

Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?

Randy, Randy! Your son's on the phone!

You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.

Time to end this hobby once and for all!  No! NOOOO!

What happened to him, Doctor?

Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes. 

It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore.

Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald.

There's our boy. 

Where... where am I?
