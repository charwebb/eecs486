You should have never come to our town! 

And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere.

That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start? 

Time to end this hobby once and for all!  No! NOOOO!

Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about.

Alright, you can take the paper bag off.

So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.

Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars.  It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front.

Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! 

We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him!

It's because he is.  His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place.

Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!

Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!

It's still here, ih... it's all still here.

Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!

I'm just checking in on you, Butters.  Heh- Do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded!

Inside.  I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news.  Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?

Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?

What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing? 

No. I've I've got to tell him!  Butter? Butters! 

No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him.

Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.

Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!

I think it's best we try to reason with it.

Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!

Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money?

Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!

I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!

Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.

Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine.

It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!

I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell.

Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.

I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?

You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.

O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago. 

Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?

Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!

All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay.

Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!

Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib.

My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.  All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page,  it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did?  We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!

Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.

Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! 

Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!

Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  One! Two!  Uhh, Bu-Butters?

Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea.

I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore!

And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done!  Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to "Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?"! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!

Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it.

Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore.

There! Look!  It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.

Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son! 

No, no, wait a minute,  that's ridiculous.  What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see?  If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it. 

You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. 

And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!

I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family.

Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.

I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.

Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life.

That's right!  If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!

Oh butter! Oh Butters, I miss you so much! 

Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!

It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead.

That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!

It's called "working" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!

You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!

Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.

Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!

Look, I I need we need to find a way out under the city.

Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!

I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect.  What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet. 

You're back. You're back-he's back!  I love you son!

There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!

You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in.  I'm telling you Gerald, havin' a Handicar is a grat way to make some money on the side. 

Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct.

Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night.

No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.

I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.

That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.

So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!

Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys.

Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I!

Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts.

Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What what did he do?

Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!

How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!

DON'T YOU HI MOM AND DAD US YOU LITTLE PUNK!!! "(Punch)"

WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?!

It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.

All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it.

Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination.

That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?

Thank you so much for taking him in.

That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.

It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he is grounded.  And no bouncing the racquetball either!

Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now.

Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.

Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!

Bring him back? W-What are you talking about?

Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!

Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.

Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now!

Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!

I'll never give up!  I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!

We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son! 

Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!

Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?

Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here.

All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!

It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!

But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!

Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you.

Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called "hapahui apahoha", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.  Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you. 

Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you.

Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?

Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?

No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up.

Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!

Oh my God! These people don't even know!  Hurry! You gotta go!

All right, damn you! The children can come in!

Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?

Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??

Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?

Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?

A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.

It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. 

You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!

Go go go go back the other way! 

OH YOU'RE GONNA GET IT MISTER! Just Wait until I get home!

Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing.

Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive.  We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King. 

Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!

Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork.  What's the matter, Butters?

You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-

What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son.

Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son. 

Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes. 

I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!

Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad. 

Yeah. We figure that if our boys are goona be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too.

You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!

The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.

Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.

I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation.

Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks.

Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.

You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY! 

Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... 

Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk.

Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!

Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.

Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady.

If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby.

No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision. 

No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?

Butters is our son. He's not for sale.

Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?

You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!

Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.

Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth.

Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. 

Just let me sign.  All right, he's coming to you.

Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office.

What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!

Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?

Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!

What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!

It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.

That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.

Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?

No. All the phone lines are completely down. 

I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.

Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way.

...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?

Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister! 

Well well well! I had to see it to believe it! 

Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!

Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?

Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend?  Sally Darson?

We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.

A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.

Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!

The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald.

All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah!

I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you.

Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it...  flies by itself.

Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend.

Son of a bitch, it's him all right!

Butters, play!  Start playing right now, young man! 

Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.

Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!
