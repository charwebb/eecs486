How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
You keep it under my side of the mattress.
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job.
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
You went to a bachelor party at work?
We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
No! In the beginning we were not good.
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.
[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
The board voted last night to close your branch.
Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.
You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
I don���t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
You son of a bitch. You���re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you���re a princess. Mommy, you���re a superstar. Mommy you���re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide?
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
Now you're really not allowed in this session.
Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
I don't care how your day was Michael.
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that?
You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
This is a projection of the county's needs...
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
How do you know I like that store?
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
I don't think Christian has time for that.
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
You had no right to do that, Michael.
Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
And you guys have a good time together.
I've never told you that I love you.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Well, it���s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ���Cece��� is two letters and ���Astrid��� is... I mean, there���s even some adults who -- who -- who can���t spell it.
Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars.
[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
So, which health plan have you decided on?
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
...and I have to get back to work.
Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
What the hell are you two talking about?
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
Can we just move on to another question?
It's not about a surprise party is it?
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
