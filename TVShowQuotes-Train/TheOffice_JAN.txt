Yeah.
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.
Ok.
Michael, it has nothing-
Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed.
[sigh] Is Toby there?
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
Fine Michael. Thank you.
Hi.
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Tell me what you did yesterday.
This is Jan.
All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
[under breath] Heaven help us. [aloud] Specifically.
[coming up suddenly]  Are you eating?
Four million.
Astrid.
What do you mean?
Michael.
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
Yeah, it did...
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
See you soon.
What did you say, Michael?
Josh Porter, Stamford.
On a what?
[on speakerphone] Michael, ...
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really.
Men love this one.
Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
NO!
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
Specifically
Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar]
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
No I'm the princess, and the queen.
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
Well, you should.
Good.
No rhyming!
This is a very important-
That's too bad.
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
When did the check come?
Tell me what?
It's... it's about talent.
Goodbye, Michael.
Oh, me too. Me too.
Michael?
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
I'm divorced.
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Uh, I'm fine, thank you.
Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
So, what's Ryan doing here?
So-
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
Where's Michael Scott?
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
That's my new assistant.
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
You are not allowed in this session.
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
What?
Hey babe?
Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars.
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
I don't think Christian has time for that.
Please, sit yourself down.
Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
You mean breastfeed?
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
Stop that.
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
What does that mean?
[on phone] Hello?
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
So which way is Chili's?
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
You son of a bitch!
Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.
Oh. [door closes]
[talking over Michael] Yup. Yes.
Hi, Pam.
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Why?
No, I do.
Shut up.
Ohhh, God.
Great.
Smoke?
I'm not going to do that Michael.
[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
That is an excellent goal.
[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you���re a princess. Mommy, you���re a superstar. Mommy you���re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
No! In the beginning we were not good.
Thank you very much.
No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
Michael.
Christian.
Hello?
Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
Please don't smell me, Michael.
All right. Let's talk about clothing.
We have gone through this.
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
I...
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
Thank you, thank you.
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
Do we understand each other?
What is Diwali?
Michael, we discussed the IRS's regulations.
If you have a-
No.
Just the one.
What have you generated, Michael?
Oh, please.
Pam?
It's nice.
[on the phone] This is Jan.
Don't say another word.
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
How do you know that?
No, Michael. Oh, come on.
What did I just say?
I'll talk to you later.
Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
Hi.
Fine, fast food's fine.
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
No.
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
I don���t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
Right uh, Michael.
You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
How about Chinese?
You're over 75 years old?
Michael.
Yes.
See, he fits perfectly.
I am returning your many calls.
I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.
Been good.
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
Thank you.  That's very sweet of you.
Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.
Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
Thank you.
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
No, it's not possible.
I -- I --
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Period.
A booze cruise? What do you mean?
Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael.
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
No smiling.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
[scoffs] I'm not sure that's realistic.
Yeah!
Okay.
Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!
I went to a sperm bank.
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
Back?
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
Michael---
---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
...Happy birthday, Michael.
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
We got it!
Am I on speaker phone?
You went to a bachelor party at work?
I'm your boss.
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
[Sigh]
It was me!
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
Don't date Holly.
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
Michael?
If it's a couple blocks away-
Bye-bye.
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
Just Jan Levinson.
I���m a very busy woman, so...
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Oh, God.
Well, it���s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ���Cece��� is two letters and ���Astrid��� is... I mean, there���s even some adults who -- who -- who can���t spell it.
So... we're good?
I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
This is a projection of the county's needs...
We're in a meeting.
[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Why would we need a signal?
Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
What?
Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
Good. Have you told anyone?
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
Of Ed?
Wait, wait, what cartoons?
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
I'm not...
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
Who is this?
[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
What are you doing?
Michael, just relax, okay?
Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?
What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
Michael, I need your help.
OK, name please.
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Is it really that important to you?
Period.
Incidentally, what is the charity?
Thank you.
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
What, Michael.
[in Scranton] Where's Michael?
What did I tell you about 'yeppers?'
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.
Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
Follow me.
[on phone] I'll be right there.
You know that I'm very serious here.
I mean...
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
And you had a luau....
I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
Oops.
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
Thanks Pam.
Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
Yes, Pam?
Joe Camel!
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
I know Scranton.
Mmhmm.
Well it was good to see you.
[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
[to Ryan] Hey.
Uh, yes.
Did you take care of the situation?
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
Ok.
[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
Ah.  Thanks, Dwight.
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
The board voted last night to close your branch.
I think you can.  I... what?
What's going on?
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
Are you there Michael?
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
If you can account for your time...
I know what a futon is, Michael.
Now you're really not allowed in this session.
You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
Tell me what you did yesterday.
[laughing]
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
Yeah.
Oh.
Okay. [Carol stares at Michael]
Well, this is a highly exclusive establishment.
And Michael Scott, Scranton.
Wha...
Michael?
... happen when...
That's not what it's called.
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
[sighs] I'll see you in ten minutes.
YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
This is my baby.
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
Michael.
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that?
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.
Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
From sales?
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
At least he's an artist.
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
Hello everyone. Hello Michael.
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
Michael.
Uh, yes, I did.
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
We discussed that.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
Does this work for you?
I don't care how your day was Michael.
Hi.
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
From the Scranton Branch.
No.
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
I've never told you that I love you.
The person that you fired, Michael?
Okay.
It's pine.
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
And you guys have a good time together.
Aw.
I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
Great.  Very good.
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
[doorbell] Oh, excuse us just a second.
[walks through front door] Michael.
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
Yeah?
Michael.
Oh, yes, you will.
Where���s Wallace?
What are you talking about?
Can we come in?
You drive, I had too much wine.
Michael, Ed died over the weekend.
I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
I didn't...
Is anybody else in the...
Michael?
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
Please? Thank you. very much.
Why did I hook up with Michael?
Erratic?
... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
Bye Babe!
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
That's not my sense of humor.
Michael---
Great. Phyllis?
In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
It's like nothing's happening.
No.  But we can offer you 12.
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
You son of a bitch. You���re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
Yeah.
Great!
That sounds serious, Michael.
I can't, I can't-
Mm-hmm.
Best decision I ever made.
Are you hearing me?
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
A little amuse-bouche, anyone?
You keep it under my side of the mattress.
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
No, so what couldn't wait?
Really?
Thank God.
[checking the oven] Uh, not even close.
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
We just will.
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
... touch that.
Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
IHop.
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Great! Uh-huh?
I just think that...
Ok, Toby, how about if you...
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Wha... excuse... why not?
The board's.
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Hi.
Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...
With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
We all checked in?
I don't want to...
Martini please.
That's a serious offense!
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
Yes, they know, Michael.
Hey you!
Hey. I'm leaving.
Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
What is he doing here?
Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
Just let me loosen my dress.
Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
Yes, Michael, they do.
What?
He's such a snake.
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
You do.
Oh, okay.
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
Yeah.
What would you do differently?
Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Why?
What party?
Cece can���t spell her name.
And so, good job. Good job.
Michael.
Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.
It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide?
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
Good luck, Brenda.
Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
Michael-
[singing] What did you learn?
Nice to see you too, Michael.
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
Let's go.
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
Am I on camera?
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job.
A quick drink?
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
Michael.
Good.
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
Well, what would you suggest?
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
Well...
I think so, Michael...
Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...
Hey.
Oh, how thoughtful.
How was improv?
Please sit down.
I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
Yeah.
Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
Mm-hmm.
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
Yuh-huh.
Step away from me, Michael.
I know.
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
Fine.
Still on speaker?
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
What?
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
[on phone] You're broke?
You do?
Where's Astrid?
Zoning out?
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
Hi, Pam.
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
Please don't cry.
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Hello, Michael.
[answering the phone] Hello?
Uh, no.
I just didn't!
Oh!
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
What? No Michael!
Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...
Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
OK.
That's his ex.
FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
Surely, you cannot be serious?
Good, good.
Ok. Let's just go to a motel...
The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
What? A union! What...
Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
Okay.
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
[giving a hug] Bye Hunter.
Hey, Jim?
How do you know I like that store?
Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
What's this over the 'i'?
[on speakerphone with Michael] Michael.
Oh.
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
Shame on you.
Well, today's not my birthday, so...
Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
What?
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Michael!
...in your office?
[on phone] Okay, where did he go?
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
I'm good; how are you?
When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
A futon's not a sofa.
Michael.
I'm doing it right now. To you.
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
Oh, God.
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
It's your job. So...
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
trid.
Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
Well...
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
Nice to see you.
Awesome.
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
Michael.
It's not about a surprise party is it?
Excuse me?
Uh-huh, Bonfire.
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
Nice to meet you.
It said that.
Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
Really?
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
Magically?
AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!
What?
Get yourself down stairs.
Well...
Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
Oh.
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
Today?
Hmm.
We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
Please, please.  Don't hurt him, okay?
What?
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
Conniving little runt. Put him through.
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
Are you listening to me Michael?
I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
Well, I paid for an ideal specimen.
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
Well, I'm glad you did it, Michael.
Insightful, Pam.
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
[sarcastically] That's funny.
Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Oh, hey!
Oh!
You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...
Michael! Michael! Michael!
Yeah, so...
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
What? I'm sorry?
No.
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
I didn't go.
It costs what it costs.
Alright.
Bye... thanks. [pumps fist] Yes!
Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
[picking up Astrid] There you are.
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
How's work going?
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
Gould, you said, Gould.
All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
Uh, yes. Yes you can.
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
Yes, of course, I know Kelly.
Can we please go in your office?
No it's not.  It's officially not.
Don���t patronize me.
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
Do we understand each other.
Michael!
What?
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
Michael?
Michael that's irrational.
Cosmopolitan, please.
No.
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
What about him?
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
Ok.
So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
... but it's very destructive.
Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
No, Dwight; come in.
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
No, I...
No?
I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
What the hell are you two talking about?
No, that's not---
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Excuse me?
I was stupid.
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
There's no prize money.
I bet you are.
Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
How is that a business question?
Uh- [Michael signals for her to shh]
OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
I was watching Jim.
Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
Assy! Awwhhh how was school?
What?
Michael!
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
Hi, Jim!
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
Uh, how are you?
Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
I'm closer to firing you.
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
[over phone] Mmhmm.
...and I have to get back to work.
Alright.
...then maybe corporate can justify your salary.
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.
No.
Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Are the cameras with you...
Really?
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
What are you doing here?
What's wrong with you?
Not super exciting.
Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
No. Okay. Stop. Go on...
We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
Yeah.
What's the bottom line?
Uh, yeah.
Brenda.
I didn't... I don't know...
Oh, Andy.
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
Okay!
Can we just move on to another question?
I feel sick.
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
Do you want to look at mine?
Go by yourself.
Michael.
Mich---
[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
You ok?
Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
Just like that.
Yeah. Good job.
Yeah.
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
I thought she was Muslim.
Stop.
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
Who is this?
So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'
Oh, they found her?
Michael.
And this is my workspace.
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
To kinda clear my mind.
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Uh when, when did, when last night?
Is Michael in?
K?
I love you too.
Does anyone want a drink?
So, which health plan have you decided on?
Go ahead.
[laughs] I think you can handle it.
Did you call my ex?
Nothing?
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
Not like that.
Really?
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
Excuse me.
So music, should we turn some music?
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
[looks at Lester]
I'm gonna make some calls.
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
