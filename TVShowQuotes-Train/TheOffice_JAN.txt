OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
[doorbell] Oh, excuse us just a second.
Oh, yes, you will.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Who is this?
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
[laughs] I think you can handle it.
Yeah?
What?
Let's just blow this party off.
Mmhmm.
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
I know what a futon is, Michael.
How's work going?
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
Hey. I'm leaving.
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
You went to a bachelor party at work?
Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
[looks at Lester]
... happen when...
He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
... but it's very destructive.
Michael.
Ok.
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
What is Diwali?
You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed.
Hi, Pam.
Oh, how thoughtful.
We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Wait, wait, what cartoons?
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
I've never told you that I love you.
We saw Wicked.
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really.
I thought she was Muslim.
Christian.
...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.
Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Michael.
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
Oh, they found her?
It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide?
I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
Today?
What?
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
So, what's Ryan doing here?
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
Hi, Pam.
[Sigh]
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
What have you generated, Michael?
Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
What are you doing?
Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
[on phone] Hello?
Michael, just relax, okay?
What is he doing here?
It was me!
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
Where���s Wallace?
Not too good.
Pam?
Uh, I'm fine, thank you.
That is an excellent goal.
Uh, yes. Yes you can.
Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
Of Ed?
I just didn't!
No?
Okay.
You're over 75 years old?
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
I am returning your many calls.
What did I tell you about 'yeppers?'
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
[on phone] I'll be right there.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
Excuse me.
Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
[on the phone] This is Jan.
[to Ryan] Hey.
It's... it's about talent.
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
A booze cruise? What do you mean?
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
Yes.
Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
[in Scranton] Where's Michael?
Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
Ok. Let's just go to a motel...
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
Hello?
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
Great!
Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
I didn't...
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,
Oh.
What?
Well, what would you suggest?
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Go by yourself.
Hi, Jim!
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars.
Michael, Ed died over the weekend.
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
No! In the beginning we were not good.
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
Martini please.
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
Right uh, Michael.
So, which health plan have you decided on?
Wha...
Don't say another word.
See, he fits perfectly.
Michael?
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
I'm gonna make some calls.
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
Nice to see you.
Awesome.
You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
...in your office?
Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
[sigh] Is Toby there?
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
Aw.
Michael.
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
Now you're really not allowed in this session.
Thanks.
I know.
Stop that.
Brenda.
We discussed that.
Yeah, it did...
Michael?
Just like that.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
Assy! Awwhhh how was school?
Shame on you.
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
Michael.
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
I didn't mean it. I was...
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
Hi.
So... we're good?
OK.
Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
Yeah.
Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
That's his ex.
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
How about Chinese?
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
Hi.
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Do you want to look at mine?
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'
Well, I paid for an ideal specimen.
[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
No.
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
So-
It's nice.
Hey, Jim?
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
I -- I --
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
The board voted last night to close your branch.
I hate my life.
... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
Mm-hmm.
Mich---
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
Really?
...Happy birthday, Michael.
What about him?
Thank you.  That's very sweet of you.
So which way is Chili's?
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
Well...
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
Michael, we discussed the IRS's regulations.
Good luck with your band.
Am I on camera?
What the hell are you two talking about?
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
That sounds serious, Michael.
We just will.
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
Uh, no.
I mean...
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job.
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
I just think that...
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
I don't want to...
Tell me what?
[on phone] Okay, where did he go?
See you soon.
Erratic?
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
I'm closer to firing you.
Ok.
[picking up Astrid] There you are.
You do?
If you have a-
[under breath] Heaven help us. [aloud] Specifically.
Please don't smell me, Michael.
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
Shut up.
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
Good. Have you told anyone?
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
I...
Surely, you cannot be serious?
Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
Okay, how dare you do that?
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
Really?
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
Get yourself down stairs.
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
Cece can���t spell her name.
Michael?
All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
Hey.
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
I'll talk to you later.
Hi.
I have some ideas.
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
Are you listening to me Michael?
If you can account for your time...
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...
He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
Stop.
Oh.
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
You keep it under my side of the mattress.
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
Please? Thank you. very much.
You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.
Well... well, we will.
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
If it's a couple blocks away-
Please sit down.
Thank you very much.
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
There's no prize money.
Not super exciting.
Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
What's going on?
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
Not like that.
Oh, okay.
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
You do.
Yes, of course, I know Kelly.
---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
I don't think Christian has time for that.
K?
Mm-hmm.
Fine.
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
No.
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
Follow me.
Excuse me?
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
Hey you!
Tell me what you did yesterday.
Ok, Toby, how about if you...
[Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight.
It was. Yes.
Hello, Michael.
We have gone through this.
OK, name please.
You drive, I had too much wine.
Thank you.
Don't date Holly.
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
I'm divorced.
Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
Really?
Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael.
No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.
When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
You are not allowed in this session.
He's such a snake.
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
Yuh-huh.
Yeah, so...
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
What's this over the 'i'?
Alright.
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
A little amuse-bouche, anyone?
Yeah. Good job.
Yes, Michael, they do.
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar]
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
The person that you fired, Michael?
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
That's not my sense of humor.
How do you know that?
Michael---
This is a very important-
Yeah.
Well, I'm glad you did it, Michael.
This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
Yeah.
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
IHop.
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
Oh, Andy.
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
Good luck, Brenda.
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
What party?
What?
Nice to see you too, Michael.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
Who is this?
Why?
[giving a hug] Bye Hunter.
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
All right. Let's talk about clothing.
Uh, yes.
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
No, that's all right.
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
Hmm.
Well, today's not my birthday, so...
Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
Well it was good to see you.
...and I have to get back to work.
No, Michael. Oh, come on.
Just Jan Levinson.
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
I feel sick.
Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky.
No, I do.
I love you too.
How is that a business question?
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
It's your job. So...
[on speakerphone] Michael, ...
Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
What?
And this is my workspace.
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
Michael-
Michael. MICHAEL!
A quick drink?
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
Can we come in?
From the Scranton Branch.
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
Hi.
To kinda clear my mind.
I didn't... I don't know...
Incidentally, what is the charity?
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
And you had a luau....
Back?
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
Conniving little runt. Put him through.
Don't you know what I'm doing?
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
No, I...
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
You had no right to do that, Michael.
It costs what it costs.
That's too bad.
Michael?
Hey babe?
Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...
Uh-huh, Bonfire.
What?
Did you call my ex?
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.
So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
Oh, please.
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
Am I on speaker phone?
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
Michael.
[on phone] Yeah, what?
This is Jan.
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
Michael.
This is my baby.
I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
Thank you, thank you.
I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
[coming up suddenly]  Are you eating?
Thanks Pam.
The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
Bye-bye.
No rhyming!
No, so what couldn't wait?
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
And you guys have a good time together.
Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
Hello, Michael.
What, Michael.
Four million.
So music, should we turn some music?
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
From sales?
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.
No. Okay. Stop. Go on...
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
You ok?
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
What? A union! What...
Gould, you said, Gould.
Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
Yeah.
Tell me what you did yesterday.
Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
Astrid.
$300?
I think so, Michael...
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
Does this work for you?
Why?
I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.
All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
[checking the oven] Uh, not even close.
No.
Been good.
Excuse me?
Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...
Why am I here, Michael?
Well...
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
You mean breastfeed?
Brenda.
Is it really that important to you?
Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.
Michael!
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
I went to a sperm bank.
Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
Why would we need a signal?
Really?
I didn't go.
[answering the phone] Hello?
trid.
I was stupid.
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
Yes, they know, Michael.
Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
That's a serious offense!
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
Michael!
Smoke?
You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that?
Michael, don't panic.
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
Magically?
I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
Great.  Very good.
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
Why did I hook up with Michael?
Oops.
Is Michael in?
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
Okay.
Nice to meet you.
On a what?
Michael---
Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
You son of a bitch. You���re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
I'm your boss.
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
Oh!
What?
Can we please go in your office?
Josh Porter, Stamford.
Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
Really?
Joe Camel!
Okay!
Bye... thanks. [pumps fist] Yes!
Well, Michael, I underestimated you.
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
[scoffs] I'm not sure that's realistic.
How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
I���m a very busy woman, so...
Oh!
It said that.
Oh.
What are you doing here?
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
Michael that's irrational.
[singing] What did you learn?
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
Yeah.
YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
Thank you.
[thinks for a second] Where is it?
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
Okay. [Carol stares at Michael]
Yeah.
[on phone] You're broke?
[talking over Michael] Yup. Yes.
We're in a meeting.
I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
Fine Michael. Thank you.
Are you there Michael?
Still on speaker?
[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
Good.
Just the one.
I think you can.  I... what?
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
How was your interview?
Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
Uh, how are you?
Bye Babe!
Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
Michael.
Men love this one.
Go ahead.
No.
What do you mean?
[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you���re a princess. Mommy, you���re a superstar. Mommy you���re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
I don't care how your day was Michael.
I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
You know that I'm very serious here.
You know, imagine... you were gay.
Are you hearing me?
[sarcastically] That's funny.
We got it!
No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
Hello... Michael.
I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
Michael... maybe... I mean...
A futon's not a sofa.
Let's go.
We'd been fighting for a while-
Hello everyone. Hello Michael.
What would you do differently?
Zoning out?
I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
Uh- [Michael signals for her to shh]
[sighs] I'll see you in ten minutes.
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
... touch that.
So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
The board's.
Oh, God.
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Are the cameras with you...
No.  But we can offer you 12.
You're
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
What did I just say?
How are you?
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
No it's not.  It's officially not.
That's my new assistant.
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
What are you talking about?
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
Good.
Oh, hey!
Good.
How was improv?
I'm good; how are you?
I'm not...
Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
Uh, yeah.
It's like nothing's happening.
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Aw.
How do you know I like that store?
Well, you should.
...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
No smiling.
Michael.
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
Nothing?
Well, it���s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ���Cece��� is two letters and ���Astrid��� is... I mean, there���s even some adults who -- who -- who can���t spell it.
No.
No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
Does anyone want a drink?
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
[walks through front door] Michael.
No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
Ohhh, God.
Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
Michael!
AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
What? I'm sorry?
It's pine.
OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
Michael.
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
Come on.
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
Are camera's there?
I bet you are.
Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
Yes, Pam?
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
Uh, yes, I did.
What? No Michael!
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
I was watching Jim.
Step away from me, Michael.
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
I know Scranton.
OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
[over phone] Mmhmm.
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
Insightful, Pam.
Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
Okay.
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
Please don't cry.
Oh.
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
...then maybe corporate can justify your salary.
Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
No, that's not---
And Michael Scott, Scranton.
Where's Michael Scott?
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
Michael! Michael! Michael!
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
NO!
Do we understand each other?
Specifically
Uh... come on.
And so, good job. Good job.
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
Oh, God.
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
Goodbye, Michael.
Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
Uh when, when did, when last night?
Can we just move on to another question?
No.
That's not what it's called.
Great. Phyllis?
At least he's an artist.
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
Michael.
[laughing]
Where's Astrid?
Oh. [door closes]
Michael.
No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
What?
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
Michael, I need your help.
Fine, fast food's fine.
Michael?
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
No.
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
Well, this is a highly exclusive establishment.
It's not about a surprise party is it?
No I'm the princess, and the queen.
Hi.
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
