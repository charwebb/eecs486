Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
I don't think Christian has time for that.
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
You went to a bachelor party at work?
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
And you guys have a good time together.
Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
...and I have to get back to work.
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'
Can we just move on to another question?
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
You keep it under my side of the mattress.
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
What the hell are you two talking about?
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job.
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
No! In the beginning we were not good.
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
This is a projection of the county's needs...
Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars.
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
It's not about a surprise party is it?
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
You had no right to do that, Michael.
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
Now you're really not allowed in this session.
...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
I don't care how your day was Michael.
I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
How do you know I like that store?
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...
... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
The board voted last night to close your branch.
Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
I don���t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
So, which health plan have you decided on?
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that?
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
I've never told you that I love you.
This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
