Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars.
Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
It's not about a surprise party is it?
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
Well, it���s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ���Cece��� is two letters and ���Astrid��� is... I mean, there���s even some adults who -- who -- who can���t spell it.
Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
You son of a bitch. You���re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
This is a projection of the county's needs...
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
You had no right to do that, Michael.
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
I don't think Christian has time for that.
All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
I don't care how your day was Michael.
Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that?
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
So, which health plan have you decided on?
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job.
I've never told you that I love you.
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
No! In the beginning we were not good.
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide?
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
The board voted last night to close your branch.
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
Can we just move on to another question?
In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you���re a princess. Mommy, you���re a superstar. Mommy you���re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
You keep it under my side of the mattress.
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
I don���t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
How do you know I like that store?
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
And you guys have a good time together.
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
