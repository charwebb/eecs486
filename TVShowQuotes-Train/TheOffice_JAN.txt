Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
It's not about a surprise party is it?
Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
Can we just move on to another question?
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide?
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
What the hell are you two talking about?
Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars.
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
You keep it under my side of the mattress.
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
This is a projection of the county's needs...
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
You son of a bitch. You���re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
You went to a bachelor party at work?
Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you���re a princess. Mommy, you���re a superstar. Mommy you���re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
I don���t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
Now you're really not allowed in this session.
You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
How do you know I like that store?
And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job.
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
I've never told you that I love you.
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
No! In the beginning we were not good.
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
So, which health plan have you decided on?
Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
Well, it���s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ���Cece��� is two letters and ���Astrid��� is... I mean, there���s even some adults who -- who -- who can���t spell it.
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
The board voted last night to close your branch.
You had no right to do that, Michael.
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
And you guys have a good time together.
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
I don't think Christian has time for that.
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
...and I have to get back to work.
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
