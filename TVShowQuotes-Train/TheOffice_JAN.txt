I'm doing it right now. To you.
And this is my workspace.
Hello, Michael.
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael.
Well, I'm glad you did it, Michael.
Erratic?
You drive, I had too much wine.
I've never told you that I love you.
Uh, no.
You're
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
Aw.
Yeah.
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
[in Scranton] Where's Michael?
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
Well, it���s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ���Cece��� is two letters and ���Astrid��� is... I mean, there���s even some adults who -- who -- who can���t spell it.
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
Thank you.  That's very sweet of you.
Hello... Michael.
He's such a snake.
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
Oh!
Period.
How about Chinese?
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
I love you too.
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Magically?
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
Been good.
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
A little amuse-bouche, anyone?
Michael.
No.
Well it was good to see you.
...and I have to get back to work.
Get yourself down stairs.
You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
Uh, how are you?
What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
Ah.  Thanks, Dwight.
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
Oh, yes, you will.
All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
Michael?
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
No.
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
We got it!
Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Michael.
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
Michael.
That's my new assistant.
I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that?
No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
Thank God.
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
No.
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
Aw.
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
Hello, Michael.
We're in a meeting.
We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
Ok.
Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.
Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
Well, you should.
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
Who is this?
The person that you fired, Michael?
Hello?
Oops.
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
Am I on speaker phone?
So music, should we turn some music?
I didn't... I don't know...
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
Uh-huh, Bonfire.
All right. Let's talk about clothing.
Oh, God.
Well...
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
You son of a bitch. You���re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Okay!
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
Specifically
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
Good, good.
Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
Okay. [Carol stares at Michael]
Yuh-huh.
I can't, I can't-
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
From sales?
This is my baby.
[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Michael, it has nothing-
Bye-bye.
Hi.
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
The board voted last night to close your branch.
Great! Uh-huh?
I'm gonna make some calls.
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
Goodbye, Michael.
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
What is Diwali?
Just the one.
Fine.
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
Insightful, Pam.
[checking the oven] Uh, not even close.
I just didn't!
Hey babe?
What did I tell you about 'yeppers?'
What?
I don't think Christian has time for that.
[giving a hug] Bye Hunter.
Assy! Awwhhh how was school?
Yeah.
Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
Josh Porter, Stamford.
No?
Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
Michael, please.
Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed.
It's like nothing's happening.
You know, imagine... you were gay.
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
Why?
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
Excuse me?
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
[Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight.
No rhyming!
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
What?
Michael. MICHAEL!
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
Best decision I ever made.
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
This is a projection of the county's needs...
I know.
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
And so, good job. Good job.
Michael?
Michael! Michael! Michael!
Fine Michael. Thank you.
Why would we need a signal?
Hello everyone. Hello Michael.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
Oh.
How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
I didn't go.
Michael---
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
Nice to see you.
Thank you.
Uh, yes.
You went to a bachelor party at work?
Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky.
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
We discussed that.
I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
Okay, how dare you do that?
What?
Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
What?
How do you know that?
Great. Phyllis?
[coming up suddenly]  Are you eating?
Not super exciting.
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
I'm closer to firing you.
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
[on phone] I'll be right there.
Oh.
Well, today's not my birthday, so...
OK.
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
Are you listening to me Michael?
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
Brenda.
Uh- [Michael signals for her to shh]
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
What about him?
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
We saw Wicked.
[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Did you call my ex?
Hmm.
You had no right to do that, Michael.
Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
Uh, yes, I did.
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
Mich---
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Oh, hey!
Michael?
Right uh, Michael.
I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
Good luck, Brenda.
Conniving little runt. Put him through.
IHop.
If you can account for your time...
Wha...
Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
Michael?
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.
Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
What?
Mm-hmm.
I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
Hi, Jim!
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
A quick drink?
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
Mm-hmm.
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
I went to a sperm bank.
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
What do you mean?
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
It's pine.
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
Period.
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
No.
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
Yeah, it did...
Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...
...in your office?
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
Just Jan Levinson.
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
[on speakerphone] Michael, ...
Alright.
Can we please go in your office?
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
Really?
Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars.
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
Smoke?
Yeah, so...
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
What?
Uh, yeah.
Oh.
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
Michael-
I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
The board's.
It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide?
I thought she was Muslim.
[doorbell] Oh, excuse us just a second.
It's not about a surprise party is it?
Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
Michael.
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
Don���t patronize me.
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
Really?
Yes, Michael, they do.
Cosmopolitan, please.
Please sit down.
Can we come in?
Thanks.
That's not my sense of humor.
Good.
Not like that.
It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
No.
Good.
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Ok. Let's just go to a motel...
... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
No, Michael. Oh, come on.
I'm divorced.
Well, what would you suggest?
You're over 75 years old?
Good.
... happen when...
Please don't smell me, Michael.
You son of a bitch!
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
Tell me what you did yesterday.
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
Yes, Pam?
Not too good.
I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
Thank you, thank you.
Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
You mean breastfeed?
Surely, you cannot be serious?
Where���s Wallace?
No, that's all right.
That's not what it's called.
Hey.
Michael that's irrational.
Am I on camera?
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
You know that I'm very serious here.
You keep it under my side of the mattress.
Ok.
What the hell are you two talking about?
Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar]
Come on.
Thank you very much.
Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!
The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
Go ahead.
What?
Yeah.
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
Yes, of course, I know Kelly.
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
I think you can.  I... what?
It's your job. So...
Good. Have you told anyone?
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
I mean...
$300?
Hi.
No, Dwight; come in.
We'd been fighting for a while-
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
Well, this is a highly exclusive establishment.
[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you���re a princess. Mommy, you���re a superstar. Mommy you���re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
Oh, Andy.
Does this work for you?
Yeah!
---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
It was me!
To kinda clear my mind.
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
You do.
No, I...
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
Let's go.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
From the Scranton Branch.
Oh. [door closes]
[under breath] Heaven help us. [aloud] Specifically.
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
Martini please.
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
Michael.
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
[on phone] Yeah, what?
Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Yeah.
Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
It's... it's about talent.
I'll talk to you later.
I bet you are.
Please, sit yourself down.
Michael, don't panic.
Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
I'm your boss.
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...
Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
What party?
What's wrong with you?
I hate my life.
Stop that.
Really?
That's a serious offense!
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
OK, name please.
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Michael.
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
Uh, I'm fine, thank you.
I think so, Michael...
Michael, just relax, okay?
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
I feel sick.
[over phone] Mmhmm.
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,
Oh!
Thanks Pam.
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
Is Michael in?
Do you want to look at mine?
And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
Fine, fast food's fine.
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
Shut up.
AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!
[looks at Lester]
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
That's too bad.
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.
All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
If it's a couple blocks away-
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
Awesome.
No, so what couldn't wait?
Please, please.  Don't hurt him, okay?
Well...
Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
[picking up Astrid] There you are.
Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
Are the cameras with you...
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
You are not allowed in this session.
You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
Alright.
How's work going?
Great.
What? No Michael!
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
Bye Babe!
What are you doing?
It was. Yes.
Brenda.
Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
Why?
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Ok, Toby, how about if you...
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
Oh, please.
Do we understand each other.
Oh, okay.
[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
No.
I'm good; how are you?
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
Oh, they found her?
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
Really?
Just like that.
What is he doing here?
Hey, Jim?
At least he's an artist.
Hi, Pam.
Gould, you said, Gould.
Nothing?
[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
Yeah.
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
Michael... maybe... I mean...
[on phone] Okay, where did he go?
That's his ex.
No.  But we can offer you 12.
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.
Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
Christian.
Oh, me too. Me too.
FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
Hey you!
Michael!
Michael---
[sigh] Is Toby there?
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
Let's just blow this party off.
[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
Excuse me.
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
Follow me.
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
Are camera's there?
Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
Uh when, when did, when last night?
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
I have some ideas.
Michael?
Really?
This is a very important-
Great!
Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really.
I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
No. Okay. Stop. Go on...
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
Excuse me?
I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
Uh... come on.
Michael.
Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
See you soon.
What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
[Sigh]
Okay.
How are you?
No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
Wha... excuse... why not?
Don't date Holly.
Are you there Michael?
What?
How do you know I like that store?
[thinks for a second] Where is it?
Good luck with your band.
Michael!
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
No! In the beginning we were not good.
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
On a what?
Still on speaker?
No, I do.
NO!
...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.
Yeah?
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
[sarcastically] That's funny.
Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.
Please don't cry.
What have you generated, Michael?
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
This is Jan.
Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
So which way is Chili's?
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
Who is this?
Nice to meet you.
[to Ryan] Hey.
How was improv?
K?
Zoning out?
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
No, it's not possible.
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
[talking over Michael] Yup. Yes.
You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...
...then maybe corporate can justify your salary.
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
Hi.
[laughing]
Step away from me, Michael.
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
Four million.
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
I don���t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
... touch that.
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
I know what a futon is, Michael.
You do?
I was watching Jim.
Are you hearing me?
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
I...
No, that's not---
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
What? A union! What...
And you guys have a good time together.
Goodbye. [hangs up]
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Michael, I need your help.
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
No smiling.
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
Thank you.
Oh, how thoughtful.
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
We just will.
What did you say, Michael?
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
A booze cruise? What do you mean?
...Happy birthday, Michael.
Cece can���t spell her name.
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
Tell me what?
Well... well, we will.
Is it really that important to you?
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
What, Michael.
Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
Pam?
I just think that...
I don't care how your day was Michael.
It said that.
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
I am returning your many calls.
How was your interview?
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
I know Scranton.
Bye... thanks. [pumps fist] Yes!
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
When did the check come?
Where's Astrid?
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
Joe Camel!
What?
Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...
You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
Mmhmm.
Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
[sighs] I'll see you in ten minutes.
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Hey. I'm leaving.
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
That sounds serious, Michael.
Yes, they know, Michael.
Michael.
[scoffs] I'm not sure that's realistic.
See, he fits perfectly.
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Yeah. Good job.
Oh, God.
Oh.
Well...
Well, Michael, I underestimated you.
Why am I here, Michael?
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
Michael!
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
Tell me what you did yesterday.
Don't say another word.
Do we understand each other?
So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
I'm not...
Okay.
What are you doing here?
If you have a-
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
Just let me loosen my dress.
So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'
What's the bottom line?
I -- I --
Great.  Very good.
Is anybody else in the...
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
So, which health plan have you decided on?
How is that a business question?
Michael.
I was stupid.
What are you talking about?
[answering the phone] Hello?
And Michael Scott, Scranton.
Did you take care of the situation?
It's nice.
Incidentally, what is the charity?
Go by yourself.
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
Excuse me?
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
No it's not.  It's officially not.
I don't want to...
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
There's no prize money.
I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
And you had a luau....
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
That is an excellent goal.
Now you're really not allowed in this session.
Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
What's going on?
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
You ok?
trid.
Yeah.
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
[walks through front door] Michael.
Hi, Pam.
Today?
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
Shame on you.
Michael, Ed died over the weekend.
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
What's this over the 'i'?
Yes.
Nice to see you too, Michael.
Well, I paid for an ideal specimen.
Uh, yes. Yes you can.
[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
Back?
Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
Of Ed?
