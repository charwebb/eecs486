Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
And you guys have a good time together.
I don't think Christian has time for that.
Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
This is a projection of the county's needs...
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you���re a princess. Mommy, you���re a superstar. Mommy you���re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
You had no right to do that, Michael.
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
You went to a bachelor party at work?
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
So, I'm happy to be here.  It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
It's not about a surprise party is it?
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
No! In the beginning we were not good.
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Of course.  I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest]  Michael!
You keep it under my side of the mattress.
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
So, which health plan have you decided on?
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job.
Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that?
He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
How do you know I like that store?
Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...
[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
Well, it���s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ���Cece��� is two letters and ���Astrid��� is... I mean, there���s even some adults who -- who -- who can���t spell it.
[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?
Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
I don���t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
I don't care how your day was Michael.
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
Now you're really not allowed in this session.
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
The board voted last night to close your branch.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide?
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
I've never told you that I love you.
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
...and I have to get back to work.
Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition.  It's not going to be in front of a judge.  And it's four million dollars.
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
