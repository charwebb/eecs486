Hi, Kramer.
What, you got a little thing for her?
I didn't pick up anything.
No good?
Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?
Ah ah ah ah
Well, what could she have done?
I'd like you to leave.
I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.
(To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt.
Yes, I see. O.K.
That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.)
What, do you think I've never had a massage before?
Well no, I feel full after the Risotto.
Maybe.
Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
I love Merlot.
Well, it's not like after the Risotto.
Anyhow, what is the difference?
Really enjoyed it.
Six.
I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
But I've never sung before in my life!
Why?
I'm very satisfied.
You're going now?
You really know a lot about this, don't you?
George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.
Jerry?
I'm a little nervous!
Well, now I hate you!
Well, I'm wearing this red dress -
Of course.
Really.
Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?
As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
(To Kramer) I really wanted you.
So soon? (they get up)
What, what?
Well hurry up.
My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
Yeah
It must have been an accident.
Yeah.
No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on.
Mmm What's not necessary?
O.K., this is it!
She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.
What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?
All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
Kramer, are these questions really that important...?
What else?
Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.
You think I was faking?
They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!
What are you talking about?
(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad.
I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)
That is so funny.
Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.
You were extremely personable.
I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
Generally.
Magic.
Oh, so do I.
