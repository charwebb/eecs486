So soon? (they get up)
Well hurry up.
(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad.
Six.
Ah ah ah ah
I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
Well no, I feel full after the Risotto.
What are you talking about?
I'm very satisfied.
Oh, so do I.
I love Merlot.
Kramer, are these questions really that important...?
But I've never sung before in my life!
You were extremely personable.
Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.
What else?
(seen through George eyes all blurry) Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.
I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)
Jerry?
As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
Anyhow, what is the difference?
That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.)
Well, it's not like after the Risotto.
Really.
No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on.
That is so funny.
I'd like you to leave.
What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?
Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?
Well, what could she have done?
Yes, I see. O.K.
Yeah
She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.
What, you got a little thing for her?
I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
Well, now I hate you!
I didn't pick up anything.
Really enjoyed it.
Hi, Kramer.
They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!
It must have been an accident.
No good?
Yeah.
I didn't see a face.
(moaning) Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm (lights a cigarette) Mmmm (takes a puff) Woo
You're going now?
George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying "instead of the movie...")
You think I was faking?
Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?
I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
Mmm What's not necessary?
O.K., this is it!
I'm a little nervous!
Magic.
You really know a lot about this, don't you?
What, what?
I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.
Maybe.
Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
Mmmm, Oh George, oooh.
Generally.
Because I said so. (pushes George off the bed)
(To Kramer) I really wanted you.
