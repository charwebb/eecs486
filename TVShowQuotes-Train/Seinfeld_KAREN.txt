What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?
I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying "instead of the movie...")
(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad.
You really know a lot about this, don't you?
(seen through George eyes all blurry) Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.
They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!
She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.
Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?
(moaning) Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm (lights a cigarette) Mmmm (takes a puff) Woo
But I've never sung before in my life!
Well no, I feel full after the Risotto.
Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.
(To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt.
What, do you think I've never had a massage before?
All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.)
Because I said so. (pushes George off the bed)
What, you got a little thing for her?
I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)
I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?
George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.
