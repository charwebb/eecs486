My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.
(moaning) Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm (lights a cigarette) Mmmm (takes a puff) Woo
Because I said so. (pushes George off the bed)
(To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt.
Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?
I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.
All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
What, you got a little thing for her?
George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.
Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.
What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?
She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.
Well no, I feel full after the Risotto.
That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.)
I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
You really know a lot about this, don't you?
As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
What, do you think I've never had a massage before?
Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad.
They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!
I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)
George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying "instead of the movie...")
(seen through George eyes all blurry) Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
