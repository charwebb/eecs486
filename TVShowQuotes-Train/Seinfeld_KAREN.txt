Maybe.
George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.
Yes, I see. O.K.
I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.
Mmm What's not necessary?
Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?
Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?
Really.
So soon? (they get up)
I'm very satisfied.
What, do you think I've never had a massage before?
I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
Really enjoyed it.
What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?
Kramer, are these questions really that important...?
Well, what could she have done?
You really know a lot about this, don't you?
Yeah.
Six.
Anyhow, what is the difference?
O.K., this is it!
What, you got a little thing for her?
Because I said so. (pushes George off the bed)
(To Kramer) I really wanted you.
No good?
(moaning) Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm (lights a cigarette) Mmmm (takes a puff) Woo
She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.
Yeah
You were extremely personable.
It must have been an accident.
Of course.
Well no, I feel full after the Risotto.
(seen through George eyes all blurry) Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
Well hurry up.
Well, it's not like after the Risotto.
You're going now?
Mmmm, Oh George, oooh.
But I've never sung before in my life!
You think I was faking?
I'm a little nervous!
All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
I love Merlot.
My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)
I didn't see a face.
That is so funny.
Magic.
Ah ah ah ah
Why?
What else?
Jerry?
I'd like you to leave.
Hi, Kramer.
No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on.
I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
What are you talking about?
Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.
Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.
As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.)
Generally.
I didn't pick up anything.
George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying "instead of the movie...")
What, what?
Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
