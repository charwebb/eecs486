On her person? What kind of expression is that?
Good. Now get out of here before you find yourself on transit patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.
I don't know, but I don't like it.
Oh yeah, right. Maybe it was one of your other personalities huh, the wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ball player, maybe the door to door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. You just couldn't help yourself, could you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out.
She was. Not any more. Somebody saw to that.
You killed all the pretty flowers, didn't you Kramer? You killed the pretty little flowers, didn't you? You dirty, filthy, stinky weed! Didn't you?
Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer. My God is the god who protects the innocent and punishes the evil scum like you, have you got that?
You are under arrest in first degree murder and death of Ms Chelsea Lang.
Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this, uh, Kramer.
Ross. Do you see that person there, Ross?
You see something even remotely pretty and you have to choke the life out if it, don't you Kramer?
You heard me, let him go. They just found another body at the Laurel Canyon. Go on Kramer, get out of my sight.
Now you might beat the gas chamber Kramer, but as long as I have got a breath in my body you will never ever see the light of day again.
Society is filled with them. They're choking the life out of the all pretty flowers.
No! You have made the mistake, Kramer. Sickies like you always do. The only difference is that this time you're gonna pay.
