Put it down, I said-  Augh!  Gawhh 

Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.

The President?

Come back here, God damnit!  He's getting away! 

Can I help you with anything?

1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,...

She must... die.

I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine.

And now touch your finger to your nose.

The law is the law sir.  You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir. 

The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?

...Sir, why don't you step out of the car for me?

You sure you don't want to press charges?

You boys! Trent is trying to tell us the fire was your idea.

Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it. The list was compromised. Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class. 

Thank youuu!

All right, gig is up. Put down the gun!

If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir.

Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.

Code word is "stretch," copy?

Fudgecicle! 

Hey you kids.

What the hell do you think you're doin'?

Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now.

Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.

License and registration, please.

I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time!

Touch your finger to your nose.

You say something?

Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything.

Up in the Yukon. All bureause are confirming it.

Just bring one hand to your nose, like this. 

Sir, I'm going to give you a sobriety test.

...I understand. My, my brother's an alcoholic. Here, let me push you to the front of the line. 

Drop the gun and step away.

Did your son say anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?

Wait. Look! Up in the sky!

Ow!

So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin.

Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs? 

90-Marshmallow, 91-Marshmallow  This is making me hungry for marshmallows  92-Marshmallow 

Stay back, people!

Tell him we won't shoot him, Boss.

What did they rob, sir?

Stand over here, please?  Right there. All right, now I want you to hold your arms out at your sides... 

Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson! 

All right, you, it's time to go.

Let's go.
