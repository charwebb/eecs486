You boys! Trent is trying to tell us the fire was your idea.
Did your son say anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?
Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.
90-Marshmallow, 91-Marshmallow  This is making me hungry for marshmallows  92-Marshmallow 
...Sir, why don't you step out of the car for me?
You sure you don't want to press charges?
I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time!
Stand over here, please?  Right there. All right, now I want you to hold your arms out at your sides... 
Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it. The list was compromised. Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class. 
What the hell do you think you're doin'?
Up in the Yukon. All bureause are confirming it.
Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.
...I understand. My, my brother's an alcoholic. Here, let me push you to the front of the line. 
Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs? 
Okay, were you wit a cruise ship or land tour group?
Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything.
Just bring one hand to your nose, like this. 
Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.
So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin.
Sounds like an open and shut case. All right, let's head 'em out! 
I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine.
The law is the law sir.  You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir. 
The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?
All right, gig is up. Put down the gun!
And now touch your finger to your nose.
Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now.
If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir.
