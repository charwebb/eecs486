(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
You and your cigars..
(Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.
(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)
(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
(Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.
(Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?!
I want to know who John is!
Oh.
It's Cornish gamehen.
If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke.
Oh, mother.
Something's missing all right.
Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.
Where is it?
Right over there.
Is it possible they took it back?
We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water.
You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in ....years.
My favorite.
(sniffing) What is that?
Oh, God.
This is - this is...horrible.
I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!
Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.
George... we'll leave you alone with her.
I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
Hello, George.
We know the last three months have been hard on you.
Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.
Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?
So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
Uh, who?
Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.
Thank you for calling, George.
Oh, you're George's friend.
Really?
Sounds grand.
Tell us more.
Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.
We don't like you, George.
He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
