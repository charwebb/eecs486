(moaning) Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm (lights a cigarette) Mmmm (takes a puff) Woo
I'm very satisfied.
I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
Maybe.
Generally.
Well no, I feel full after the Risotto.
Jerry?
Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.
Well, it's not like after the Risotto.
Mmmm, Oh George, oooh.
Mmm What's not necessary?
What are you talking about?
What, what?
You think I was faking?
I'd like you to leave.
I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
Because I said so. (pushes George off the bed)
Well hurry up.
(seen through George eyes all blurry) Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
That is so funny.
I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.
So soon? (they get up)
Yeah.
Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.
Really enjoyed it.
She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.
Yeah
You were extremely personable.
I didn't pick up anything.
I didn't see a face.
Anyhow, what is the difference?
George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying "instead of the movie...")
Ah ah ah ah
Of course.
What, do you think I've never had a massage before?
George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.
What, you got a little thing for her?
What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?
You're going now?
All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?
Well, now I hate you!
As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
You really know a lot about this, don't you?
Well, what could she have done?
What else?
No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on.
Really.
Magic.
Six.
Well, I'm wearing this red dress -
No good?
Why?
That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.)
Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)
Yes, I see. O.K.
Kramer, are these questions really that important...?
My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!
It must have been an accident.
O.K., this is it!
I'm a little nervous!
But I've never sung before in my life!
(To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt.
Oh, so do I.
I love Merlot.
Hi, Kramer.
Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?
(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad.
(To Kramer) I really wanted you.
