I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
I want you to go see somebody.
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
You're back.
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
More stuff?!
(To George) How much is there?!
So, how are ya, Jerry?
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
So what are you gonna do?!
George, where are you going?!
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
(Getting angry) I said milky white!
I'm sorry.
(Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful.
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
(Yelling) George likes the bananas!
(Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
Phil Casacof?
He doesn't know anything about bras.
I am not giving him a bra.
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
I think they are made from lycra-spandex.
I'm not betting!
All right, I'll get a bra.
Here, here's the bra.
(reading the bra) 100% lycra-spandex.
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
You got ketchup on it!
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
I like tap dancing.
Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
Somebody's at the door.
(answers the door) Lloyd?
Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.
What are you doing here?
Georgie. Come here and say hello.
Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with your arm?
Me, either.
Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?
Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
Oh, it was good seeing you.
You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?
She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.
Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.
Hello, hello!
Oh, the house looks very nice.
Hello Jerry.
Ah, your father...
I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
What is this doing on my bed?!
Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?
Where am I going to sleep?
I can't sleep in there!
I can't! (screams) I can't!
Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.
Oh, hello Elaine!
My coffee table!
It's mine. I'm his mother.
George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
George what are you doing in there?
You dont feel well?
I want to know what youre doing in there.
Georgie.
Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control.
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
How could they have plans?
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
Maybe they don't like us.
Ah keep quiet.
You think they're coming tonight?
Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
I heard noise.
Alright Frank that's enough.
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
The hell with them.
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
Hello
Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)
Kramer, I love that shirt.
You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
This is the best thing we ever did.
Ah forget about them let's just...
Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
Jerry, did you hear this?
(calmly) We're not getting divorced.
He looks ridiculous in that thing...
(shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
Georgie's right. (pats him on the cheek)
It was that Chinese woman.
(giggles) Yes. Who are you...?
(steps back, appalled) You're not Chinese!
You're not Chinese!?!?
I thought you were Chinese!!
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
Well... then... that changes everything!
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
So, is your father excited about coming home?
George?
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
She was a lovely woman.
Physically?
Well, you've seen pictures.
So what?
Big? No, just my height.
Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
Where do you get your genes from?!
(shocked) Oh, my god!
Is it safe to come in?
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
Alright, let's go.
I can't tonight, I'm busy.
I'm having dinner with someone.
Sid Farkus.
Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
So, I'm getting an eye job.
Georgie, I'm a divorcee.
Well, I'm out there, George.
I am, too!
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
This is the only time the doctor *has*.
So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.
Uh, Bakersoll.
Oh, I don't care.
Oh, okay.
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
Oh, really?
And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
Did he say "Assman"?
Oh my goodness.
Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
Don't upset me! I can't cry!
Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
Fusilli?
The proctologist? Are you okay?
Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)
Oh, I can't help it!
Oh!
Georgie, can you zip me up?
Well, come on!
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
I don't like that tie.
It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
We forgot to bring it in.
People take buses to get that rye.
Yesss?
(gasps)
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
Are you sure you're talking about George?
What extremities?
So George, why are you here?
What's this.
I don't bet.
I don't swim.
Are you trying to get rid of us?
Hello Seinfelds.
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
I know, we were looking at the brochure.
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
We're moving to Florida.
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
(warmly) Ohhh.
What does he want with your swim trunks?
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
The first game?!
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
Oh, my God!
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
(Looking at it) Yeah, what is it?
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
Here's your omelet.
That's the way I always make it.
What did you say?
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
Frank, I'm cold!
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
(shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie!
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
We were just being nice.
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
How many times can you check the car?
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
(shouts) You're driving me crazy!
(shouts) Nooh!
That's as far as it goes.
I pulled it. It doesn't go.
I told you to fix that thing.
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
(From other room) It's junk.
(From another room ) You're late!
(From another room) Good for you, Lloyd!
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
You're not gonna give away that water pik!
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
All right...
Move your crap, I'm comin' in!
(answering the phone) Hello?
Let me put your father on the phone.
(feigning a Chinese, muffled voice) Chinese food.
Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?
Uh... the phone broke.
Oh!
The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
(looking inside of the van) Wow!
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
Your father's right. It's beautiful.
(on TV) Stop squirming.
(on TV) Georgie.
Leave him alone!
Dinner's ready!
I think you can take him, Georgie!
They picked up the show?
The NBC guy liked it?
He told you he liked it?
Well, what are you doing?
You know how to write?
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
I did not smother him.
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
Sorry to bother you, Judge.
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
You know
