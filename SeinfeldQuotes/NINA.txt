(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving.
No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to do.
I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that.
Tell me about Elaine.
But, they're still friends.
Don't you think that's strange?
Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)
Oh, are you interested?
Are you an art-lover?
Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)
(laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)
My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.
Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?
She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!
Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!
What's the appeal of the posse?
Hello, George.
Well, I really love that piece.
No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!
Honestly, George, the money's not important.
Elaine?
(rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?
Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
Okay.
Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)
Good, good.
No... not really. You?
Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.
I don't know... maybe.
Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?
Oh, I'm so full.
Will you excuse me.
I just need to freshen up.
George I need to freshen., George, George, George ...
Mmmm mm so good.
Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.
What are you doing here George?
(Casually) Alright.. Neither.
A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.
George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.
George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you?
By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya?
(From Jerry's room) Jerry?
Oh. Hi.
(Getting ready to leave) Oh, I should... um...
Yeah.
Bye. (Leaves)
Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.
Really?
I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.
Heh.. yeah.
Jerry?
Hi.
Yeah!
Nice to meet you, too.
And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!
Ah, I gotta go. (Gets up to leave)
It's great talkin'
