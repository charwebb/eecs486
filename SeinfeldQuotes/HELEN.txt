Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
Tomorrow well go to a hotel.
No, why should we take over your apartment?
Your friend Kramer doesnt mind?
Why not?
He used to go with her.
Which one is she?
Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.
So, how come nothing materialized there?
I know what it was.
So, what was it?
Oh, well...
Well, I think shes a very attractive girl.
I can see if there was a weight problem...
You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?
Where do you get Loni Anderson?
I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.
And this other ones the one?
How could you still see her if your not interested?
Up to her office?
Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
So youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
Bum bum bum bum...
Wait, I just want to see something.
Quo. Is that a word?
Will you challenge it?
(to Jerry) Youre such a stickler...
Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?
Just what I said, here.
She knows what?
No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z.
Whatever I wrote down.
Who am I, Rich Little?
Oh, stop it.
...30...31...
...32...
Im not playing with you anymore.
(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!
I thought you were getting it.
You want me to get that?
Ill get it!
Hello?... Hello?
Hi.
This is your greatest moment? A game?
Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
But its their 50th anniversary.
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
So bring her.
At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.
I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.
Hes kidding, Manya.
So, did you hear Claires getting married?
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
Should we have coffee? Whos having coffee?
No, were taking a cab.
Dont be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.
You know, you should give Manya a call.
Goodbye, Jerry.
Well call you.
Who did you talk to?
And whens the funeral?
She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
What? Nothing.
Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.
The funerals Wednesday.
Two o clock, Wednesday.
What?
So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.
So dont go.
Jerry, no ones forcing you.
I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
Youre not wearing that to a funeral.
It looks ridiculous.
It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
Its raining.
(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730. Call the airlines again.
Oh I think that's them!
I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
You could have used our car.
What's wrong with our car?
We don't use it.
If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
How much is a rent-a-car?
What? You're crazy.
We'll pay for the car.
Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
The lake is real.
But it's real. It's water.
Where are you going with those?
Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
We don't even sleep.
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
Don't worry, he's comfortable.
Will you stop?
Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
Well I tought that...
(quieter) What happened?
What does that mean?
Elaine...
He's an idealist.
He likes looking.
But how long can you look?
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
For fun?
Oh I had a coke.
Jack, what are you doing?
(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
You didn't have to take it.
Because you made such a big fuss about it.
You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
He loves that pen.
He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
He didn't think you'd accpet.
I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
Yes.
You're going underwater?
What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
What's the matter?
What happened?
(to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
So stay home.
Don't go.
No, we'll stay in there.
Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.
You're hot?
I don't even know how to work it.
Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
How did you know that?
Blanche?
What did Blanche say?
Morty.
Is that what she said?
Blanche.
Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
But your back hurts.
No. I'm fine.
No.
Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
What happened to your eyes?
With the instructor?
I told you...
It's from scuba diving.
I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
Say it.
(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.
Jerry, do your act.
They're all gonna leave.
(to Jerry) Do the dog routine.
(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
I don't think so.
Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
I was very comfortable.
It's in the constitution.
And they liked the idea?
Since when is George a writer?
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
What kind of problems?
What? He's not even working.
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
Were you waiting long at the gate?
Where's that watch we bought you?
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
No, I don't think that.
Morty, what are you doing?
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
What guy?
Why?
So why did you say anything?
Are you okay?
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
He's what?!
He's after you?
Why is he after you?
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
Well you must have done something.
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
Huh, Jerry, don't say that.
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
Kramer?
What was that about?
How can anyone not like him.
Well, it's not the sofa.
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
Leo says he's the best there is.
Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
(enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
Well the doctor must be busy.
(enters) What's going on?
What?
The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
You could've taken it with you.
Leo, where did you get that watch?
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
Let me see that.
(indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.
Just okay?
She's better than nice.
She's beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.
I'm not gonna ask her out.
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
It was... different.
What's the matter with you?
Why didn't you flirt with her?
She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
You just sat there.
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
Jerry.
(to Jerry) You're not paying.
You didn't have to throw it out.
Oh, that must be Leo.
He has nothing to do.
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
He turned it down?
Why did he do that?
What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
What's the matter with you?
Four thousand apiece?
That's gotta be Leo.
I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
He's something, you son, isn't he?
How could anybody not like you?
(hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry.
What?
You're kidding.
How could anyone not like him?
Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?
Who is she? When did this happen?
Morty, you're talking too loud.
You're hurting my eardrum.
Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
What?
Uncle Leo said.
A discount on dry-cleaning?
Why are you doing this?
Why?
I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
Tonight?
(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.
(turns to Jerry) We have plans.
(annoyed) We have plans.
(turns back toward George) Maybe
Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
Since always. We've never liked them.
Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
We adore Elaine.
What's he like?
A what?
They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
Hello Aaron
Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.
We can't take money.
(grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?
I wouldn't be any trouble?
When would we go?
Are you sure?
Ok, let me get my coat.
Bye.
Aaron is quite the tour guide.
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
Oh thanks again.
We have no plans.
Why would they? Know body bought them then.
You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
You're crazy.
Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
Oh you have to go you have to
You have to
I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
Hello, Hello.
You don't mind to you Elaine?
Ooh.
We didn't know you had company.
Hello Rachel.
Uh we'll come back another time.
Whenever
No we don't mind
O-oh are you sure?
Cuz we don't wann..
Nice meeting you.
Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.
He looks better on TV.
Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
How are you gonna get all this done in time?
So how was the movie?
And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)
What did you think about the black and white?
Well he told you about the place.
You find something you get a fee.
Well it's too late now.
Well you're not gonna say anything.
(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
Wondering what?
Well we already saw it.
I'm afraid I don't.
Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
Jerry sends his laundry out.
How could you?
You were making out during Schindler's List?
How could you do such a thing?
He broke the window?
Tomorrow afternoon?
We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
Some place else? What about Paris?
I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
I think you're out of your mind.
(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
Buh bye.
(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
Oh, Morty, please.
Morty, will you stop it!
Jerry?
Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
Hi Jerry......What's wrong?
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?
Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
Macadamian nuts?
Jerry, are you sure this all right?
I'm next.
Nana!!!
Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.
I don't like all these open boxes.
(shock) Oh, my god!
Just like that? No calls?
To what do we owe this great honour?
Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.
(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?
He's not buying us a Cadillac.
It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.
Your father doesn't need a car.
Oh, Morty.
Over my dead body.
Impeachment?
Can they do that?
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
What'd he say?
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
(surprise) The Lichtenberg's?
We weren't invited.
Yeah.
Morty, you're driving me crazy.
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
Maybe you've seen him on television.
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
(pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty.
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
You're not buying us dinner.
Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.
Doris.
Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
I can do that.
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
Ok.
All they serve is chicken?
Hi.
Why, you thinking of moving?
He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
Hi Elaine.
No.
What?
Why?
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
Elaine, I really--
You want my urine?
I don't know.
Well, what am I gonna do it in?
Jerry's glasses?
Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
Or maybe a juice glass.
This one is kind of scratched.
Howbout A milk glass.
Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
George must be happy about that.
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.
We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.
They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you...
Jerry, we can only stay four days.
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
Jerry, be serious.
We already sold it.
Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.
Hi Kramer.
Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.
Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
Who cancelled?
He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.
F. F, E, L , D.
He's not there?
Where's Jerry?
Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.
Who was that?
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
Where would you work?
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
Besides, that condo was too much house.
Jerry, she's fantastic.
She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.
You're being very rude. Come on, Morty.
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
You should be more mature.
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
(to Jerry) Goodnight.
You have to go see him.
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
What about you?
We just came down for a funeral.
See you downstairs with the car.
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
He calls every week. Are you all right?
He says he's fine.
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
We let you sleep in.
Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.
I'm right here.
Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.
Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
Yay! Jerry got it open.
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
Even so, the press would bury him!
The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.
(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
Who wants hot chocolate?
(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
Nobody pays for everyting.
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
It was a crime of passion.
He won't last a day in prison.
Congratulations, they're doing the show.
She's not six-six.
I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
Cereal.
I'm bringing it for Jerry.
He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
