Hello!
(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
Jerry!
Helloooo!
Ha ha! How are you?
How's your mom and dad?
What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
You know where I just came from?
He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'
Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.
Nobody got a gun to your head!
Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.
You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
Hello...
I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
And you walked out without paying.
Well, I hope you send him a check.
What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
I said it once.
You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
(grudgingly) She's awright.
(to Morty) Where's the bathroom?
They give you some portion here, huh?
(preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.
Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.
(sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)
Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.
(indicating) I've never seen a band like this.
You have it on you?
Leo.
Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.
Hi, hi...
Yeah, I hate to give it up.
Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?
(traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!
What're you doing here?
Yeah, me too.
Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
(grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.
Give it to me.
Jerry, will you give me the bottle?
Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.
What fifty dollars?
Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.
(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.
(defensive) One second...
I love these nuts.
No more nuts. Awrghh.....
They said they were sending an Asian woman.
Jerry, hello! (Sits down)
I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But I'm not.
Why didn't ya say hello?
(Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.
Oh, they don't care. We all do it.
Senior citizens. No big deal.
Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?
Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
(Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!
Jerry, you ratted me out?!
Hello.
(Bitter) Jerry.
(Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
If anyone betrays me, I never forget.
(Leo has "Jerry" written on the fingers his right hand, and "Hello" written on his left. He's doing pull-ups) Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. (Turns to the right, yelling out) Answer that damn phone!
