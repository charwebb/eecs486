Hi.
How are you?
Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
The junior?
I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
Its Gina.
Martines girl friend.
You next door neighbour.
Come on.
We dont have enough time.
There is no time.
All right. Go ahead.
No, go ahead.
Will you just get it.
Forget it. Come on.
You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drakes Coffee Cake.
He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
I wasnt.
No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
Tell me everything.
I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
Are you afraid of him?
Then kiss me.
Yes, right here.
You dont want to?
Then kiss me right in front of him.
A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?
I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
Who are these Stooges you speak of?
Tell me about them. Everything.
You will show me The Stooges?
When?
Come, you walk me to a cab.
Youre still afraid. You are not a man.
Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
