You think so? (she nods and walks away)
I'm buying the suit.
Excuse me, do you work here?
Then what the hell business is it of yours?
Really?
This Monday?
Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
Where is it? Where is it?
You bastard! You hid the suit.
I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!
It's an antique.
Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there.
What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
Look, you wanna get hurt?
I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.
Just pick it up.
You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.
Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.
Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!
Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)
So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
Thanks. Hi everybody.
Ah, could you repeat that?
(apologetic) I..I'm sorry. What?
Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.
(to Elaine) Just wanted to say hi.
(cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?
Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
Hi.
These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
What seems to be the problem?
That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
Well you already said spite so......
No...you said spite...Too late.
. Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this number.
Well.....
Nicole Millers, We're not expecting any Nicole Millers, in fact we have too many as it is.
Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven.
Who! Who is burning the flag?!
Him?!
Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!
Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?
