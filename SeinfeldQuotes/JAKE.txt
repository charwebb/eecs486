Well, you notice anything?
Ooh...
You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.
She did.
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
What?
What is it?
Tell me.
What are you talking about?
So?
What's so curious about it?
Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!
So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
No thanks.
Where did you get those?
Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
Then when did you get those?
So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
I would like to be alone now, please.
Goodnight!
Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.
I can't tell you that.
Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
You're saying you didn't say hi.
So that's what you came down here to tell me?
You never said hi?
You still like me, don't you?
Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
Where did you get those?
(notices glasses) Where did you get those?
Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?
(to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those!
