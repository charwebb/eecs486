I'm a great skier.
Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...
...When I travel.
The valet had such bad B.O.?
That's a relief...
It's still there...
It still smells.
Hello.
Sign here.
Sure.
Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.
Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.
No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)
Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)
Hi.
I missed you.
I don't remember the last time I felt this way.
I think about you all the time.
Do you think about me?
What friend?
You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.
Hi.
Today?
Sure.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
It's just too bad.
Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.
Yeah, sure.
Throw it!
The couch!
I'm the exterminator.
Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
Do I know you?
Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?
I'm the exterminator. (Morgan confused)
Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.
