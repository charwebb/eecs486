I don't know where it is.
I think I'm parking my car.
I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.
Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
I was closer to this space than you were.
I can if I have room!
No, I'm not gonna move the car.
Oh, you're not?
Is that Jerry? Jerry?!
Yeah, I know Jerry.
What's the difference?
Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!
Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?
Yeah.
Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
Hey Krame! You know this guy?
(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!
Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
A flea market? You went to a flea market??
And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
Will you move it up a little bit?
No no, I was further in.
Do you mind?
Who are you?
Oh, right.
What are you asking this guy for?
Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?
Well I'm going.
Why won't you go if I go?
What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.
Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?
He begged you?!
Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was
Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
Neither do I!
Welcome aboard.
I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack.
Really?
All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.
What's up?
(sees and is enthused, coming over) Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!
(pauses, struck by J's attitude) Either of you guys wanna place a bet I'm your guy.
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?
Hey, what time you got?
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. (leaves)
(comes up) Hey. Jerry.
(a little anxious) Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.
'Cause I don't have the money..
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.
Oh. Let me see.
(desperate) I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!
Thumbs!
(from inside the trunk) Oh! Help! Somebody, help! Help!
(desperately anxious) Oh God, I'm in trouble..
(running in, still hoarse, desperate!) Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didn't commit suicide! (rushes up to podium!) She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!
