Bread -- $2 extra.
You want bread?
$3!
No soup for you! [snaps fingers]
You're pushing your luck little man.
Yes.
Very good. Very good.
You know something?
No soup for you!
Come back one year! Next!
Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line!
You just cost yourself a soup!
Ohh! This city.
So, continue.
All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it. So, take it, it's yours.
You are the only one who understands me.
Yes. That is right.
How can I tolerate any less from my customer?
Por favor?
Adios muchacho!
You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up!
Go on! Leave! Get out!
Next!
You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.
That is my recipe for wild mushroom.
Mulliga...tawny?
Yev Kassem.
No! Next question.
They used to come to my restaurant.
You want bread?
Three dollars!
No soup for you!
But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day, she came back.
That's my recipe for wild mushroom.
She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business!
What did you say?!
