Aaahhhgggg!
Mr. Steinfeld?
We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?
It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.
You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.
Oh, Excuse me.
There's a clock over there.
(pointing) There.
It's right by the escalator.
I told you, it's right over there.
Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!
(to George) Hey, do you have the time?
George?
Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.

(To secretary) Expira te afuera.
What is your name, Senor?
So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?
(Confused) Cigars?
What about cigars?
Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..
(Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.
I like that jacket..
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.
You've done it again, C.K.!
No.

I didn't. My friend was getting it.
All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.
You're soaking wet. Who are you?
Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold.
Let's smash it!

I've never seen hands like these before..
Ugh.. Ray.
(Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love..
Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.
(Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I uh only hope you have a little more self-control.
(Pulling a slip of paper out of his coat pocket) And here's your check. (George accepts) Thank you very much. (Pats him on the back) It was an honor.
Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck.
Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had.
Hey hey, I'm on line here.
Who's that?
Alright, see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey.
What's the problem?
I did? Where?
Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?
I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.
I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. (He starts pulling her to safety)
(waiting in line for tickets, he overhears Elaine) Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth!
(with disbelief) You'll never pull it off.
Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.
I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the lineup?
Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward.
Please, rest Mr. Pitt.
Took a very dangerous combination prescription heart medicine and these other pills.
Okay.

I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'
Are you going to eat thoise fries?

Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.
Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.

But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!

My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place.
She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.
Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--
You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her.
Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes.
