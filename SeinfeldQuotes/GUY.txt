Hey, sorry I took so long.
You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?
So what do you do?
Are you? Lemme ask you something. Where do you get your material?
What kind of voice?
How come you keep tapping your head.
On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver. The man devoted his whole life to the peanut. Imagine having so much passion for something.
Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.
I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.
Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.
Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...
The bug boy.
Really? But, it's a little bit slow out there it rained last night.
His father was a mudda'?
His mudda' was a mudda'?
The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a kid so I have to stick tissue up there
Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.
Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?
No, we all have to talk.
We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.
It's him.
If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.
Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?
What did you do?
Oh yeah right, me neither. Hey I didn't do nothing!
Brutal.
I don't know, five bucks a night.
Hey, you guys aren't cuffed. What are you, narks?
Really? Well, that's very nice.
A dollar a night?
That stinks!
Oh, Ann Landers sucks!
(indicating a cigarette) Do you mind?
Alright Tim, I'm gonna get goin.'
Yes?
Malaysia.
Yeah.
Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.
But I, I can barely see without these.
Well, these were expensive.
I'll go get some more beer.
I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on the president.
Is this Elaine Marie Benes?
We are with the American Medical Association. Can you confirm the correct spelling of your last name? Is it B-e-n-e-s.
Good bye.
