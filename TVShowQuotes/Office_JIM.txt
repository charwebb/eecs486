Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Nothing.
All right. Take care.
Yes?
Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
It's not on your desk.
Why not?
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
How do you know it was me?
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Tonight, hopefully.
What's going on?
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
Yeah, yeah.
Um... What's in the bag?
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
Hey.
How are things?
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
Good. Good.
That's great
Yeah?
Am I walking out?
Yes, I... Do you want to...
Great. Let me just...
[Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
Do you really have to do that right now?
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
That is not the expression.
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
Solitaire?
Six on seven.
So then, why didn't you do it?
Who doesn't love that?
Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
: Uh, is that it?
Hello? Hello?
What are you watching?
Really?
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...
Oh, yeah. She's hot.
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
Hey.
We can go.
That's fine.
Uh... Not a bad day.
Freecell.
Well, I mean.
Um, what's going on here?
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
Yes, yes.
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
Go get 'em.
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
I think she wasn't wearing a card.
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
Interesting, what's that like?
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Gosh.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
It says 'workspace'.
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
You are not my superior.
I thought it was a workspace?
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
Workspace.
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
Oh, great.
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Thank you.
What are you talking about?
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
Absolutely not.
No I didn't.
Killer nanorobots?
Sounds tough.
Do you?
Mmm hmm.
Yep.
Good luck. [closes door and locks it]
[answering phone] Jim Halpert.
Who is this?
No, you can't fire me.
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
Hey Pam! How are you?
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
No, not at all.
I have nothing to do.
Oh yeah?
The mall?
Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
Um...
You're a jackass.
No. Was that the hard way?
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
Right.
Okay.
Wait, slow down.
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
Absolutely, I do.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
To what?
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
Oh yeah.
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
What? No.
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
All right.
Yeah, what do you think that's about?
I'm on it.
You are not going to believe this.
Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
I love their sandwiches too.
Their bread is very good.
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.
Sure, what's up?
Oh no?
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
What? What?
[gives Dwight a high five] Great.
Good.
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
Thank you, thank you. OK.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
Right... That's good.
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
No, no, dude, no.
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.
No thanks.
No one wants to be you, Dwight.
Is your password Frodo?
Did you just change it to Gollum?
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
It was not rotting.
Stop. Dwight, stop.
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
You don't want to arouse suspicion.
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
That's him.
Uh, I heard it.
Oh my God.
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
You coming down?
You gonna wish me luck?
Whoa.
Is that trash talk from Pam?
Oh.
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Have a good game man.
Really? I thought I'd take Roy.
My bad.
You know what? Let me take Roy.
Take it easy.
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
I didn't sign anything.
I'm trying, yup.
Great, thanks.
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
Well, then keep it.
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
Cute, sure, yeah.
She's not really my type.
Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
Too late, Kev.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
She'd be perfect for you.
So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
It's all gold.
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
You buy a purse.
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
[whispering] Here he comes, shhh...
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
He did pick a good one.
A futon?
He's a grown man
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
Hi.
I'm Jim, by the way.
Hi Katy, nice to meet you.
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
What's up?
Thank you for choosing me.
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
Yeah.
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
And stuff... yeah.
What are you doing?
Okay.
That's cool.
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
Okay.
Alright.
Goodnight, Michael.
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
I got it.
Have a good night.
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
You're not going to freak out?
Oh, really?
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
Went well?
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
Hey, Dwight. I need your stapler.
Oh, great thanks.
So, you ready for the... the Dundies?
What?
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
Oh!
Oh.
Yeah.
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
Second drink?
[starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev.
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
What a great year for the Dundies.
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
What?
Okay.
I don't know, what?
Oh my God! You are so drunk!
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
He's a volunteer.
Dwight come on, come-
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa, careful, careful.
No you don't.
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
Shoot.
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
Alright.
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
Mmm-hmmm.
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
Well, you seem to have this under control.
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
Good one.
What award would you like to give Dwight?
Okay.
Dwight, this is crazy.
Dwight, Dwight.
The other volunteers.
Hey.
Um... I don't think so.
Oh! There it is!
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
Well done.
Topical.
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
Except pass that breathalyzer.
I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
Oh yeah?
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
No, thanks. I'm good.
Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
Hey.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing]
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
Mm-hmm.
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
Wind.
Perfect. [misses]
Oh.
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
Wait a minute, what is this?
What?
Really?
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
[flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH!
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
Why?
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
Fair enough.
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme]
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
Hum.
Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
Here we go.  Here we go.
Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
Thank you, delegate from Iceland.
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
Hey.
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.
Notify the athletes.
Michael.
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
Nice.
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
Those are the doves.
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
Okay, what?
Okay.
Nothing.
What do you call it? Schruteball?
Did you just come up with that?
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
Wow. [cup tinkles]
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
Okay.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
Okay.
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
Okay.
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
And, um...
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Nice. Third book?
Okay. Phyllis.
Nice.
I guess.
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
Nice. Smart.
Okay. Thought people read more books.
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
Wow.
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
Unforgivable.
Good.
Pam? Get us back into it.
Five movies. Go ahead.
Ooh, definitely in my top five.
What?
Okay that's five.
Pam, play by the rules.
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Um, not neccessari...
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
Dwight. Dwight.
Come on Dwight! Use words.
Who goes to business school?
He does?
What?
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
Yeah. You're right.
Alright buddy.
Nothing.
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
Hey.
Good, how are you?
Good to see you, too.
Yeah, I am too.
What answers?
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
Yeah?
Sure.
Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that?
Oh, the best.
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Yeah.
Kevin, do it.
Groundhog Day.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
And then you go to school for three years.
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
A semester?
Wow.
Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, okay...
Nice.
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
Um. He sticks to his guns.
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
Um... it's in Maryland.
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
Um... yes.
Michael, I really didn't mean to...
I'm sorry?
Oh, you want me to be you?
Okay.
Oh, are you firing Creed?
We should switch seats in order to...
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
Wow.
That's an overreaction.
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
Okay.
Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
[picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
It wasn't me.
Yeah, I know.
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
What's up, Hef?
That is weird.
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
I think you should retrace your steps.
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
I know.
Uh, yeah, ream.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
Umm...
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
Was that your mom?
Oh, I thought it was your mom.
Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.
Ok.
Uh, Larissa Halpert.
117 Mount Bergin St.
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
Well, at least I don't have cavities.
Thanks.
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
No I'm not.
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
Ok, say please.
Please?
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
Ok, Roy?
Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
I can't. I just got a manicure.
Just have Dwight punch you.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
Obviously.
Yes.
Uh, Kitchen.
Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?
I don't know.  He looks pretty scrappy.
True. Meredith.
Okay. Roy.
Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?
No.  They're in the conference room.
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
No...
We are doing worst first dates.
Wait, when was this?
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
Agent Michael Scarn.
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
Oh yeah-
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Dwight-
Do you want to play-
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
Yeah?
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
[Pam lights a candle] Wow.
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
No way.
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
Really.
Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
Oh, come on, Pam.  I-
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
No, not at all.
Uh hmm.
Sure.
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
Well, it's just a movie, Dwigt.
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
Yup, I guess so.
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
No.  Thank you.
Done.
S'ok.
You're not having sex.
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
Ok.
We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
No, we don't.
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
I win.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
Duh.
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
Ohh...
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
Hey, how's it goin'?
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
No, that was unbelievable.
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
Oh-
Yeah, no, I don't think you can.
Ummm... no idea.
Yes.
Then why the question?
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
Really?
You have a better idea?
I'll use that.
So, that's... It's great.
Yeah. You have fun?
Did you go to first base?
Oh, yeah?
Did you go to second?
Second.
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
Pop-up?
Really?
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
Which one?
He can't hear you?
I know.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
Are we in danger?
What?
Hmm...
No.
[humming]
Uh hum.
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
Oh, uh, no. Could-
Could, keep that down.
Because not everybody knows about the party.
Umm, Michael.
Because it's a surprise.
Uh hmm.
So, don't tell.
Ok.
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
I know.
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
Oh, ok, cool.
Hey.
Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.
Oh, um... .I can't.
Uh hmm, definitely.
You do?
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
Really?
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
Improv sounds great.
Alright.
I think Stanley just coughed.
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
That's because Mark's my roommate.
Uh hmm.
Oh, uh, later-ish.
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
We can talk about that later.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
This is my desk.
My home office, this is it.
Ok, sure. Will do.
Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right.
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
Oh yeah.
Thank you.
Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin' fun?
Chicken, hot dog, burger.
There is soda inside.
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
Really?
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
Oh?
Uh, yeah, I guess.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
I think I did a pretty good job.
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
Yeah?
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]
Great. Where did you get it?
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
There's a little more to it.
What is Yankee Swap?
I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Sure you don't want the teapot?
Right.
No. No. Definitely. It's ..
Got to be kidding me.
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
You don't even drink tea.
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
But ..
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
Hey.
What's up, buddy?
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
Who, Steve?
Oh, there it is. J1.
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
Yeesh, how old is this ship?
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
It's not hilarious, but...
Um, no.
Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
Well...
Oh, um... [A long silence.]
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
No.
I don't know. Let's break up.
What happened to you?
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
What a night.
She was always engaged.
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
Yeah, I know.
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
She's engaged.
Huh.
No, I really don't want to.
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
Yeah.
[off camera] Yeah, that's right.
What?
What's going on?
I'm sorry? Pam.
What is going on?
Hey, whoa, Michael...
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
You burned
Oh...
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
Oh!
He hit the pole!
It's broken right, he can't...
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
So, where are you shipping your foot?
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
And that isn't weird?
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
Fine.
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
What are you doing?  What, stop...
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
You can't lay down.
Wake up. [sprays Dwight]
I'm just gonna get...
Just keep him awake.
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
Well, I think she has a kid.
Come on, get inside.
We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
We're going to the hospital, Michael.
Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight]
Give the bottle to Michael!
[to Michael] Will you stop?
Michael stop.
Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]
Stop [sprays Michael]
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight]
Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
Uh huh.
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
Ok.
Bye.
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
And doctors.
I'm gonna pull the car around.
Do you speak Spanish?
No, I don't.
Not much what's up with you?
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Nothin' much what's up with you?
[mouthing] So close.
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
Hey Michael.
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
Umm, hmm.
Nobody.
Alright. Great. Thank you.
I'm going with grape.
Which one?
I don't know what you mean.
Uh, uh, ok.
I'm going to take off actually.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Thanks.
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
Nope we're not brothers.
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
Wow, that's not what I meant.
Thank you.
Thanks, thanks Dana.
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
Hey.
Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
Big day.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
Oh you did?
No, no, you saw through me, great.
Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
Ok.
Hey.
Umm, what happened?
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
Good.
Ready?
Wow. Thanks.
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
Oh, nothing.
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
Oh, nothing.
Hey!  Welcome back!
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
Good!  What's goin' on here?
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
[smelling the stink] Oh.  Wow.
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
...which I guess I'll be taking.
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
Hey, Kelly.
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
Allergy to... the desk?
It's the lever on the side.
No, I don't think I can...
Hey!
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
What do you think of Kelly?
Are you interested in her?
Really?
She said lots of things.
I have no idea.
Yeah.  Sure.
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Yep.
What?
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
Hey.
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
And then you just changed desks, right?
To one without a cubicle.
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
So, that's how it's gonna be.
What is?
Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
Oh, no, no. No.
Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
Yeah. I like talking to her too.
Yes. Yeah.
Yep. Cool, man.
Ponies.
Flowers.
Hey!
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
Did you really?
Oh.
Good.
Nice. Well, what's it all about?
I think you should do it. That's great!
So you're not doing it.
Why not?
Come on.
Roy said that.
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
You are?
Oh, that one was good.
Do you mean vibrate?
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
I dunno, it's on
It was there when I sat down.
Hey Kelly. What's up?
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
Wow.
Wow.
No, don't be.
I bet.
Alright. [Kelly squeals]
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.
Animalian?
Why?
You're writing something?
Okay.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
But I know how to spell it.
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
So now you're writing two things?
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
Can we not?
Still want that.
Cugino's pizza.
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
What did I do to deserve this?
No.
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Can I go?
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
What is that?
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
When did you go there?
Really for like how long?
Where do I want to go?
No. We're not.
Which means absolutely nothing.
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
Maybe. Thanks.
Yeah. I'm definitely going.
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
I'm... leaving on June 8th.
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Alright.
Goggles?
Bribery. Nice.
The ocean.
What are you reading?
Aww, best book?
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
Really?
Yesss. And you're Abby, right?
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Let's start with... your mom.
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.
That's pretty funny.
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Absolutely.
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
Yup.
All right.
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
Oh, okay.
Kelly, you know what...
Sometime today.
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
[puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?
Yeah, you don't?
...Okay.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
Just... quit stalling.
Such a dork.
How old are you?
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
You... owe me.
Think you can let go?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
Is that Michael?
...It's something to think about.
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
You look cute today, Dwight.
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
Whoa. You are a volunteer.
And that's not the same.
[interrupting] Volunteer duty.
Well, your office is behind you.
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Now how do you know how it works?
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
Oh...
[mouths] C'mon!
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
Hi.
How much time do you have left on your break?
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
[growling] Nice.
Yeah.
Um, [gives Pam a look]
Whoa.
Yeah.
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Dwight tried to kiss me.
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Yeah...
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
Oh.
What did I write?
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Maybe Stanford would be cool.
Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
No, Pam.
Pam, it wasn't her.
I'm the one who complained about you.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
You know, it was one day.
And I took it right back. It was like...
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
Oh, thanks.
I don't know.
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Probably is.
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
Maybe poison?
My God!
Not bad.
What does Level Red mean?
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
I can always kind of win at roulette.
Yeah.
Mind control.
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
That doesn't exist anymore.
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Guys, the Afghanistananies.
What are you doing?
Till Death Do Us Rock.'
Oh.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
Let's do it.
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Yes.
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Let's take a look. Nice.
What?
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
Wow. Oh!
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Kev!
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
Yeah, right.
What was this? [Makes face]
Really?
Wow. I think you're bluffing.
Oh. Three nines.
Thank you very much. It was fun.
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
No, thanks. You having fun?
Yeah, we all really...
Well, I think you look great.
Yeah, why did you?
Oh, yeah.
No.
Okay, will do.
Hey, how's it going?
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
No, I...
I was just... I'm in love with you.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
I just needed you to know. Once.
Yeah.
Don't do that.
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
No I'm not drunk.  Are you drunk?
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
Uh-huh, yeah.  I am.
OooOK.
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
Oh, I can do that.
What's gay-dar?
I miss that.
Let's find out. [starts typing]
Oh! Lots of results.
It's really good to see you, man.
Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
No, it's not. I did. Yep.
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.
That is a lot of liquor.
And a dart board.
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
Yeah.
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Oh yeah?
Oh, tell him I say hi.
Hey, how is... Toby?
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
Michael, it's really not a competition.
Michael.
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
Can I get a drink?
Can I get a drink?
Yeah.
Michael...
Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
Nope, that's okay.
That's all right.
Yeah. Okay, maybe.
Hey.
How are you?
No, we used to. Now we're friends.
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
Um, sniper rifle?
I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
I'm trying---
Oh.
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim]
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
Hey, Jan.
[nervously] Pretty good.
[baffled expression]
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
Oh yeah, definitely.
What's up?
Oh.
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.
Really?
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
And then we checked the fax machine.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
Nice!
Sounded good.
Where'd I find what?
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
Umm... sure.
[chuckles] He's so cute.
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
Sounds good.
What?
Is it?
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
So I guess I can't get up.
Sure.
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
Ah, hey.
Hi.
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
So...
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Oh, good.
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
How far away did you think we were?
Yeah. I have a question for you.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
Ok, I said average.
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
No.
65. Ok, no need to laugh.
Respectable?
Right.
Ok.
Yeah.
I know!
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
No, you're making this up!
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
And how many kitchens?
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
Most apartments these days have like three.
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
Pam?
Pam?
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
Oh, no no.
Yeah, uh, well.
Ok.
Yeah. Bye Pam.
See, that's weird.
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
Sorry.
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
Thank you.
Scuse me?
Wow.
Yup.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
What's that?
Yep.
Oh, Holy Mother of God.
Good.
Oh.
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
Okay.
Oh.
I'm a drunk driver.
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
So good.
Nope, I got eel.
Hey.
Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
Really? Wow... that's bad.
Well, I work here now.
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
Hey, do you have a second?
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
What does that mean?
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
Wow.
Thank you.
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
Okay.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
You'd actually move to Scranton?
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
Okay.
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
Yeah.
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Sounds good Andy.
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
Right.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
You, too.
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
Hey, Dwight.
Okay. Sounds good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No. Looks good.
I'm not.
I am.
Okay.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Oh.
You know, man, it's really you're call.
[whispers] Let me get that for you.
This one taken? No. Good.
Hey, Toby!
How are you, man?
I just wanted to say hi.
Oh. Is that like your new thing?
No. It's cool.
All right. Good to be back.
All right.
No problem.
[off camera] ...what?
Kelly!
Really?
Great. What's new with you?
Oh, this looks promising.
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
You feel good?
All right.
Hey!
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
Okay.
Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
Don't...
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
All right!
Does he ever.
Yeah, it does, actually.
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Ok, thanks.
Hey.
I thought you had already... left.
Oh... Good.
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
O..ok. Um..good.
Right.
Yeah. Good to be back.
Hey, Kev. How you doing?
Okay.
Smart. Good. [to Angela] Hey, Angela.
Bye, Angela. All right, Kev.
See you later.
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
Huh.
Seems like a nice enough guy.
What about, uh.. [points at Meredith]
Really?
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
For the North.
Obviously.
Sorry. Man. [Pam hesitates and then leaves]
Yeah.
Hey.
Just about... yup. Now.
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
[picks up phone] Jim Halpert.
...Okay I can't... help you... with that.
She is dating Ryan, I think.
She's... high-maintenance.
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
...Absolutely you should.
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
Frisbee-based competitions...
She...
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
Jonas Salk.
Justin Timberlake?
What is that, like... five pounds?
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
Yup. That's perfect.
Hey.
Perfect.
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
Where... did you learn all of this?
So, not prison.
What'd you do, Prison Mike?
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.
Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.
Merry Christmas Dwight.
Wow. What have we got here?
Dead goose.
All right.
Wow. Win-Win.
Wow. What kind of bike is that?
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
What?
Are you serious?
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
No, because of the promotion.
It just feels a little bit, like...
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
OK, I think I can help here.
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
Permission denied.
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
Yes.
No, it's not.
Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep.
Probably.
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
All right [high fives Kevin]
What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
Thank you.
No. She wasn't.
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
Sorry.
You what?
Yeah.
You just had a rebound.
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
Oh no, that would be great.
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
So, really, you're just calling her?
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
For what?
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
You want to talk about it?
Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'
Yikes.
Fantastic.
Hey.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
Really?
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Hmm, what?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
Urkel Grue.
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
Definitely.
[raises hand] Are you stoned?
In the picture, are you high?
Is that not what happens when you're high?
Oh, loves it.
Green walls.
Ooh... fancy.
[Dwight and Andy stacking boxes rapidly] Nice.
Okay.
Hello.
Yeah, you can.
For this?
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
Yeah. Right?
Ok.
Yup. I'll trade.
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
You still do that thing?
After you sir.
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
We can custom make them.
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
[Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.
Thanks.
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
We should go on a double date.
Sure. Look at you!
Beesley, coffee?
All right.
Yeah.
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
Which one was it?
Cool.
Oh
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Congratulations.
Big deal.
Ok.
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves]
Is that you singing?
Nice job.
You gonna answer it?
Yikes.
Thank you.
I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
Hey.
So Andy is in rare form today.
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
Fine. Party pooper.
Hey, Ryan?
You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
I liked you better when you were the temp.
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Okay, good. Stay right here.
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
So weird.
No.
What are you talking about?
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
Okay.
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
[imitating Andy] 'It's not freakin' funny!'
Hey.
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
Hey.
Ugh.
Oh yeah.  Why?
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
Yeah, I know I should.
No, I'm sure you're right.
Really?
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
Absolutely not.
Stop.  That's disgusting.
Fine.
Sally.
Blonde.
Are you okay?
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
Have you ever seen a stripper before?
Yeah, me neither.
Hi.
[Phone rings] Oh God.
Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
[Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?
[Windows reboot sound] Altoid?
[Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight?
What are you doing?
What?
So what's in the box?
Those flowers are nice.
Phyllis and Robert.
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
Did you ever see that movie?
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
Hey.
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
I know. It's very cute.
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
Ow!
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
What are you reading?
Oh, that could be interesting.
[clears throat] I am ready.
Five.
Hmm... Five.
Yeah.
No, I got it.
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
Another worm? Like, are they friends?
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Oh. Um. I think we're good.
Yeah.
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
Yep.
Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
Gotcha. Alright.
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
Oh. Hadn't noticed.
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
Oh.
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
So, none of them?
Really?
Ok.
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
Agoraphobic?
Really?
Absolutely correct.
Kev, have a good weekend.
Here we go...
Ok...
Sounds good.
Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim]
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
Okay.  Um... Got you something.
You don't know what it is.
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
Where'd you get that?
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
I can't hear you.
Still nothin'.
No.
Nice.
Okay.
And what happens in this one?
Okay.
Can I have a raise?
[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
What?
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
So, none of that tipped you off?
Yeah, that was nuts.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it.
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
Boy I---
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
Thanks, Kev.  I'm good though.
What's what?
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
[under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice...
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
What's that?
No, I'm not gonna call you that.
Andy.
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
[half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that's too far.
You really wanna bet?
Ok, you're on.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
There's like ten green ones.
I'm gonna say fifty.
Oh, don't be that person.
Kev's out.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part.
Oh my God, there
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
Dwight...
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
Come on.
Come on. He'll listen to you.
Oh!
No no no!
OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy]
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
False.  Black bear.
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
... MICHAEL!
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
All right.
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
What's that?
You know her name.
It's fine.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
Lord, beer me strength.
Did that
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
Which one... is she?
Wow.
No, I don't think so.
Nope.
No.
No.
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
Andy--- Ohh...
Oh my God.
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
All right.
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
Probably
Absolutely.
And you should.
Andy... is having a
Good luck.'
You want music?
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Do you?
OK.
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
Spot on.
Oh, my God! Wow.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
She looks older.
No.
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
What's that?
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
You shouldn't be talking about that.
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
No, can't help you now.
No. D-
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.
Don't do it.
That's okay.
What?
No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.
You should take up a musical instrument.
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
How old do you think I am?
[shakes head]
Not that I know of.
I drive a Saab station wagon.
Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?
Yup.
[to Pam] Hey.
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
Lay it on me.
Now that sounds serious.
Which would be me.
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Oh, you don't want to know.
OK, I'll call the
[on the phone] OK.
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Mm... not really, no.
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
No. Thank you, though.
Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
I think you mean a girl's
Go crazy.
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Anna Maria's.
Six-month anniversary. What?
No, we've been dating for six months.
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
I saw him two minutes ago.
In the women's bathroom, above the sink.
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
That's pretty cool.
Really? Not Slytherin?
I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
What are you doing?
Yeah. No. Good.
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
In well?
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
Wait a minute.
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
I don't!
Nope.
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
That's harsh.
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.
Just one.
The torches are lit.
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Okay.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
He's gonna throw up.
Hey, Kev.
Thank you.
Ohhh...
No.
No way.
[exhales loudly] Andy...
Nothing.
Yup.
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Thanks, Pam.
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Whoops.
Hmmm.
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
All right.
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
You sure?
Wow.
Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?
Hm. Really tough call.
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
All right. [smiles]
Oh hey, Dwight.
Does my room have cable?
Can I change rooms?
Can I have a late checkout?
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Go.
Yeah, bigger actually.
Mm-hm.
Unbelievable.
She could put the cup right there.
Thanks.
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Oh...
Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
You mean Kevin?
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
[points at bearded man] Who's that?
Beardy?
I'm gonna introduce myself.
Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Okay.
Sure.
Thank you.
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
Thanks.
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
Yes, absolutely.
Oh, no, absolutely.
[hands David his papers] There you go.
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
[thinks] The friendships.
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
All right.  Then... it's a date.
Really, what kind of celebrity?
How much did you pay for it?
You paid for it?
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
Yeah.
What?
Who was driving?
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
I can also take 3 people.
I think she's awake.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
I will do some research.
Six of one, really.
So what's your strategy for this race?
Mm-hmm.
What?
Why won't more people do that? [laughs]
[looks at camera] What?
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
Right!
Wow! There it is.
It is going really great.
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Yeah.
Bat birth control
Which we are.
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
Baquette.
Eww.
I can imagine.
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
[sighs] Gross.
Alright.
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
Oh, would you look at that.
Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
That's what I thought.
Right. Let's do some good.
Oh, and I get to carry it.
...talk about it.
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
Well, you're probably dehydrated.
Glass of water would be a start.
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
You are?
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
Definitely not.
Conference room?
Hey.
Oh wow, thank you.
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
Oh.
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
What?
Oh, OK.
Great. [Jim and Pam walk away]
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Oh no, we're just sitting here.
OK.
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
[under his breath] Nice to meet you.
Hey.
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
Be honest.
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
For me, it was.
Alright.
Why don't we just go by ourselves?
What about a gift basket full of cash?
Yeah, he's definitely something.
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
Into a lake.
I know.  I love it there.
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
Sounds great.
Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
That was slightly harsh, don't you think?
You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?
As opposed to...
What about cars?
They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes.
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
Thanks.
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
[to Pam] Wait for it.
Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
Haha...
Uh-huh.
MmmHmm...
Oh yeah.
Alright...
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Actually it sounds like you are.
Or zipadeedoodaah.
I was... mocking.
Or a gong.
Really?  Power gel?
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
What?
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Sure we'll go.
Oh I'm sorry.  What?
Nope.
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
How's it going?
Yeah?
You look a little worried.
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
Hey man.
What's going on?
Oh yeah?
I'm driving?
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Yeah.
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
What was that?
Oh.  Two kisses.
Gotcha.
That would be fun.
Uhhh.  Can't.
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Mmmkay...
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Yep.
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Yep.
Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
You need to let him go.
Yes.
Yes, but not by kidnapping.
As a hostage.
I think you're under-thinking it.
Ransom.
What did he say?
So, we should let him go.
Okay.
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
Okay.
What have we got here?
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Which one's this? Perfect.
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
And that's when I knew. You?
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
How long have you been a man?
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
[talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.
Hey Dwight.
Do you run the bed and breakfest?
Does the Department of Health know about this?
Uh, Michael.
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
Darn it!
No, can't.
Where are you going out tonight?
I wouldn't understand or a secret?
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
How are you doing this?
Nice.
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Not even Harry Potter?
Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
Hey Dwight.
Does Mose have nightmares?
Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
Yeah, yeah.
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
You okay?
Are you a cocktail waitress?
No, sometimes its right.
Dwight, how's the hotel business?
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
Maybe you should.
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
You will never want to leave your room.
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
Yeah?
Okay.
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
Right back at ya.
Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
Okay.
Yes, they do.
Where's Dwight?
The office.
Hmm.
You're doin' great, buddy!
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
[not watching Mose]  More spins.
Nobody tell him!
You got it, you're so close!
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
Nope.
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
You playing that game again?
Oh it has losers.
Who are you talking to, specifically?
Hey.
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Yeah.
[sighs]
Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
Yep.
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
Ah, show me how this works.
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
Okay. Do you want me to stay?
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
I, ah...
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
You're welcome.
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
I just thought you should---
Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam]
Okay.
I don't want -
Mmm...
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
Yup.
Right.
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
Love it.
Mm, can't do that.
Definitely can't do that.
You know what?
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
I'm just doing my job, man.
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
What?  What?
What?
Okay, make a commercial.
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
Oscar?
So what are you going to do?
Did they?
We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
What are we doing?
We're going to Utica?
I'm not going to Utica right now.
No.
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
No, I'm not calling Karen.
What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
Are you kidding me?
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Okay.
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
Oh, God. [hangs up phone]
No.
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
What?
Okay, you know what?
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
Oh my God!
Michael, watch the road!
Michael! Michael, pull over!
Pull over, pull over!
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
No, Michael.  I'm not leaving the car.
Guy's going by. Shh.
No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
No, no, don't do anything to them.
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
Isn't that thing huge?
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
Damn it guys!
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
No, I'm not doing that.
No, I'm not doing that!
Hey Karen.
First of all, hi.
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
Copy that.
Yes?
Yeah, trying to quit though.
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
I... will... [gives up and walks away]
Hey.
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
No, that wasn't fun.
Of course I read it.
Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.
Well, you're driving, right?
Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
All right, I'm gonna go now.
Okay, I will. [idiot voice]
You embarrassed me.
Got it.
Absolutely, yes.
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Yeah?
And I am always busy.
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
Is there a limit?
Well, is that it? Or?
How so?
What's that?
Right.
Not gonna change.
I thought we had that looked at.
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
OK, great.
Yup.
That'd be great.
Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?
I do remember, yeah.
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
No... I think it's a great idea.
You know, try sending them another invoice.
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
Right? I was just thinking...
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
What's that?
Oh, sure.
OK. [Meredith leaves]
Yeah, people like me I guess.
Well I think Meredith was just --
Everybody's birthday.
What do you want?
You want a birthday pie?
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
It will be Angela.
Andy.
Not your birthday.
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Alright. [Andy rolls back]
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
Hey guys, what're we talking about?
Toby.
Oh, thanks man.
Is there anything --
Oh, OK.
What?
I remember that.
Seriously?
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
Hey.
Sure glad you're back.
You have no idea.
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
So, terrible idea.
You did do it?
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
That's what who said?
That's what she said.
How much time do I have?
All right, let's run it back.
Sure.
Wow.
Oh, I can't beat Darryl.
What, seriously? What is she saying?
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
Bring me players.
Good game Meredith.
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
I think I'm ready.
...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores]
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
So, where did you learn how to play?
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
What are you doing?
Right. There, first...
I think that's the question that you had...
Wow. [heads toward the conference room]
All right.
What are you guys doing?
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
Do you?
Yup.
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
I think you did.
Oh, I-
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Hi.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Really?
Tour, let's do the tour first.
Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
It's fire.
Just like that.
Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
Wow.
What is that chestnut?
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
What was that?
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
Katie Holmes.
Oh, Dawson's Creek.
Not really a rhyme.
Tom Cruise!
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Nevermind.
That's nice.
It's getting late.
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
Oh... my apartment's on fire
Flooded.
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
We should probably get back.
I didn't have anything, Jan.
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
What's that?
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
Oh, you don't know her.
Your mom.
Michael, you didn't even know her.
[walks up to reception] Margaret?
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]
Have I not proposed to you, yet?
Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
Nice. [fist bumps Kevin]
Where do you want to go for dinner?
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
No, no, no.
I actually know a sex model.
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
Okay.
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
How'd you get gum in your hair?
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
Thanks.
Did I? I don't...
Hmm.
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
What?
I'm gonna go to my desk.
I know.
I can't.
I'm not single.
Pam.
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
Nice job everybody. Great work.
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
You really don't have his phone number?
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Yup...
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
Haaank. Is that you?
Still haven't left the house yet, huh?
Good. Please hurry.
Will do. [hangs up] I'll stop calling.
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
I... just... if they speak Spanish.
Lucky us.
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
Well, he'll be here really soon, Kev.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
Yeah that's true.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
And in this case...
That's also not true.
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Would...
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
An urban thing...
Oh boy...
On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
A formal warning... [chuckles]
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
Yeah...
That's not a good idea.
Who?
Let's go.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
Who else is he mean to?
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
She's never worn these glasses before.
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
A formal warning, seriously?
And no one cared.
Productivity?  My numbers are good.
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
Great!
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
Absolutely, will do.
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Yep.  [Maguire keeps swinging]
Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?
Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
Oh, I like you.
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Absolutely.
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
I closed it!
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
Yeah, well, you know...Cornell.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
And how many would you like?
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Yes it is.
Oh, thank you. I've been working out.
Can't do that. Unsanitary.
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
Hey... What?
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
Yes! So when do you start?
Wow. Busy morning.
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
See how easy that is?
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
Thanks.
I just-
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
All right, well it already went through, so...
Hello?
That's not it.
Yeah.
Close.
Mmhmm.
What are the two levels?
Mmhmm.
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
Yes. You don't love Holly.
But you just met her.
Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
Yeah.
We've been through this.
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
Well, we're really happy.
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
Well we all want a good party, right?
I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
What'd you do?
Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
Classic.
Not my favorite, but...
It's not my favorite...
[gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey...
I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.
Hi.
He didn't mention me, did he?
Thanks, Toby.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
Scared me.  How's the party planning going?
So it's going great, sounds like.
Hey.
That's cool.
Sure!
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
Do you honestly believe that?
I'm gonna get a second opinion.
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
Okay, what's going on?
[smiles, looks to Michael]  Really, nothing?
Ah, they moved the shower.
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
But what have you learned about her?
Nice.
Well, I tried. [Michael laughs]
I'll just go later.
So you have the directions.
You have a toothbrush.
You have a cell phone charger.
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
What happened?
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
Bye.
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
All right!
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Uh-huh.
That's not what that is.
I would like to lose 65 pounds.
Cryogenics. Beer me five.
All right, I'm taking off.
Nope, just going to see Pam.
Maybe put up some shelves.
OK, thank you for ... this.
No.
[knocks on door] Hi.
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
But he did, right?
All right.
Nope.
Mmm.
How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
No, you're definitely the problem.
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
Fair question.
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
I know.  I suck.
Dwight says 'Hi.'
Now he is saying 'Hi' louder.
Umm...
Hey, can you go to IM?
OK.
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
[holds up an ASCII image of Dwight]
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
Perfect.
[Jim gets down on one knee]
I just... couldn't wait.
Pam, will you marry me?
So?
Hey, sorry everybody.
Hey Dwight.
What's up, Meredith?
No, you're not.
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Why, what happened?
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
Nope.
Thank you Angela.
Yes.
To get married.
Yep. [Michael hugs/tackles Jim]
Nice. [they bump fists]
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
Jackpot.
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
[stops the watch] One second.
Hey, Andy.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
Actually not.  It was really so-so.
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?
Fraud.
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
Right, the one from England.
Oh. Right, that style.
OK...
Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
OK.
[clearly just humoring her] No... way!
Ha ha. That's hilarious?
Who, Stacy?
Uh...
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
What do we have here?
Really...
[on phone] Hey!  You busy?
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
You must be out or something.
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway...
I miss you.
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
We were robbed last night.
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
I'm on minute six of this message.
The future mother of my children.
Do you need us for any of this?
5 dollars.
I can see that.
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Hey man.
Oh, I wouldn't-[clears throat]
I'm good. How you doing?
Yeah, okay.
Oh, she's good actually.
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
Yeah, she's doing really well.
She's engaged, um... to me.
Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
What?
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
Cranford?  No.  We will never watch that.
Ah, I'm sure they're all great.
Let's start with the wildcard.
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-oh.
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
Yep.
Let's move on to the next.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, that's good.
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
Mmm-hmm.
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
No.  You got that backwards.
Dave.
You are?  [Andy hisses] A cat?
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
Oh, I'll walk you out.
All right. We'll see. [to camera] No.
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
Hey, how are you?
Good to see you.
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Love that one.
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
One.
Half.
Also good.
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
Pam, don't worry about it.
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
That is good.
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
Yeah, we'd never do that.
You wouldn't tell your mom?
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
Aww.
[on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
Nope.
You must be really proud.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
How can you even be sure?
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
How was your meeting with Michael?
Was it your scores?
Mm-hmm.
Of course.
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
There's the charm.
That is me. Wish me luck.
Thanks.
I love you, too.
I'm not talking to you.
What?
Did my scores drop a little?
Are we even sure that's my file?
Well, there's got to be an explanation.
Yeah.
I think you mean smug
Michael, I'm just trying to --
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
A little bit. ... Worth it.
Microgement.
[picks up phone] Hello?
Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
Wow, this is my lucky day.
I am Bill Buttlicker.
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
Sorry. That was a family emergency.
You know what? That's private.
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
You're gonna have to talk louder.
Son, you have to talk louder.
Louder, son!
Now, you listen to me, sir.
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
I'm irate right now.
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
There is one condition, Michael.
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
Are you serious?
OK, what are you --
What's that?
Who's they?
In this car?
[turns radio down] What are you thinking?
The mob, maybe NASA.
Is there some evidence?
How many shoes do you need?
I'm not talking to you.
Pam.
No, she's not.
[behind Dwight]: OK.
Easy.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
Good one.
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Hey, how are you and Darryl?
Bye.
What was?
No, actually.
I don't think so.
Hey, how's things?
Yeah?
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
Wait, that's pretty weird.
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
No. What party?
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.
Is that it?
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
Probably just Kelly.
That's what I'm saying.
You were right.
You were right.
You knew it.
You knew it the whole time, buddy.
Wow.
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
Who's that?
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
Don't.
Perfect.
So, how you holdin' up?
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
We should take a look at those surveys.
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
Why are you telling us this?
Where are you going?
Where is it?
Okay.
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
[in office] Are you sure?
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
[looks shocked] W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
[concerned look on face] You okay?
Okay.
Alright.
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
Excuse me?
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
Thanks man.
I missed you.
Welcome back.
So why did you come in here?
Why is that, why is that weird?
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
Toby works here again.
Oh no.
You don't know.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
That's really not cool.
Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Oh thanks, Phyllis.
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Definitely we should.
Mmhmm, yeah.
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
No.
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
Cool.
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
You do?
Really?
Oh my God...
Yeah, I did. [they kiss]
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.
Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
You have to make the decision.
Hey.
Mmhmm.
Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
Yeah.
Beesly, are you threatening me?
Okay.
[shudders] Whew.
Woah, you guys going to lunch?
Mind if I join?
All right.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
Where we going?
Michael, that is hilarious.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
Yeah.
You look really pretty.
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
Yeah?
There they are.
You got it.
Okay.
Oh!
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
Let me call you right back. Okay.
Wait, what?
Truce?
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
That's the Christmas spirit.
Yes.
I will grant you one wish.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
What is it?
Wow, that is delicious.
Can't believe no ones thought of that.
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
That's cool.
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
Yeah.
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.
Do you take requests?
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
You did not know it.
Everyone knew some of it.
You knew it.
She knew it.
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
Nothing.
Why don't... Let's...
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]
No, no.
I know.
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
We can't figure that out.
No.
Please stop.
When?
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
Stop. What?
Okay, listen.
This shouldn't happen at work.
And!
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
But you're leaving...
[to Dwight] What are you standing for?
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
You okay, man?
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Nope.
Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
Thanks Meredith.
Dwight! Are your legs broken?
Andy, are you all right?
Looks like a red wire.
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
Doesn't it?
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
Thank you, accounting department.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
OH! [the 'yes she's hot team' claps]
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
Back door.
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
What?!
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
No. Michael. Michael.
[everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael!
How's that gonna help you?
Right.
And we don't know how.
Punishment fits the crime.
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
You couldn't of memorized that?
Gimme a break.
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
Hey.
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
What?
Mmm...
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Don't open your eyes.
What?
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
Do ya?
Ok. Remember Spider face?
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
Yeah... yep.
Yep. You're being replaced.
He just sent a text...
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
You ok?
Are you alright?
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
[disgusted groan]
[sighs and knocks on Michaels door]
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
I didn't, I'll look somewhere else.
All right.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
Whoa! What was that all about.
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
Okay.
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
[pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
So this is fun.
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
Okay.
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
Not even an exclamation point?
I can't believe how bad this looks.
Okay, good then.
I am working on it.
Six dollars.
I said I was working on it.
[over the phone] How old's Kelly?
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
Oh, great.
[looks at a three dollar bill]
Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
What?
Yep.
Got it.
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
And... ta da.
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
Right.
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
Birthday.
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
You know what? I could use a little help.
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
[to camera] Didn't see that one coming.
Not a surprise.
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
You haven't heard our theme, though.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Yeah?
No.
All right.
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
Thanks. [both eat cake]
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
Jimbo!
[impersonating Fonzie]  Ayyyy!
Ayyyy!
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
They're for her to look at, Michael.
Yes, let's have a word.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I understand that.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
We do.
That sounds fun.
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
Oh yeah, I understood.
No way, a 280?
Yikes.
No.  Bob, no. No!
That is a lie, that is a lie.
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
Nobody asked, Bob!
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
Here they come.
No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.
Oh great, I have to cover?
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
We were.
[emerging from the Men's room] Empty.
Oh boy.
OK.
So...
Oh initially I did.
Ding Dong.
KGB.
Ding dong.
Ding dong.
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
Free paper.'
What are you doing?
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
What power?
Well guys with girlfriends don't.
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
I'm on the phone.
[on phone] Hold on one second.
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
OK...
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
Good one.
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
No, that is what I mean.
No, stop it.
You cannot take the fall for him.
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
There it is.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
Who is it?
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
I get back from work around 6.
You can try. That, that might work.
Alright.
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
And of course, classy.
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
That's inspired.
De class���.
Hey.
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
I thought it'd be funny.
Thanks, Charles.
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Hey.
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
Second-in-command to Michael.
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
Assistant regional manager, yeah.
No, not exactly.
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
Yep. [shuts door behind him]
See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye!
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
You called any headhunters?
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
I would prefer not to.
You're starting your own paper company?
Why?
Do you know the industry is in decline?
Right.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Okay. [keeps eyes open]
I am not gonna do this.
And you are not going to, either.
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
Hey.
Nothing, just talking.
I didn't... no.
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
What?
What? Pam!
Pam! You can't be serious.
Still no.
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
[phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
Kev, c'mon.
[whispering] Would you please stop that?
You're breathing very heavily.
No it's not.
Oh no. I was just -
... Yes.
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
You bet.
Well I do.
I play.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
Maybe we will someday.
Yeah.
Let's... eh... see ya.
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
Oh, there he goes.
Yikes.
Aw, man.
Oh! Goal!
Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst.
Left.
Forward, definitely.
Striker!
Alright! Let's do it.
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
What?
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
Hi! [Awkward]
Sure!
Okay.
What the hell's a rundown?
When did you need that rundown by?
Okay.
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
This rundown better be really good'?
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
No, I....
Hey!
Okay.
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Am I going down a road?
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
-I just don't know if I can do it.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
Okay.
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Forget it.
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
Oh, God.
Hey.
Okay.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Sorry. Her day.
Are they looking at me?
Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
Oh, they're my client.
Hey, David.
[makes kissing, puckering sound]
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
Really? Does he do good work or--
[opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
Good, right?  Hello.
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
Oh, but you didn't.
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Actually here for something else.
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Oh!
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Missed the last part.
Got it.
Great work Dwight.
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
What are your top five cases?
Because you've solved zero cases.
Got it.
Can you give us a hint?
Can I address that?
Okay.
Of course.  What is like a hostage?
Strongly-painted picture.
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
Great.  See you upstairs.
Hey, you have a second?
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--
That's true.  That's right.  Yeah.
Well, what if I just do this?
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Well, that's--
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
He definitely stole my iPod.
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Mm-hmm.
That's not true.
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
And I won't.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
Take it easy.
Not cool. [Dwight still laughing]
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
No one.
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
That makes sense.
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
You ready?
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
We're gonna stay.
Yeah. At least for one more dance.
Yes.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Yeah.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Yeah.
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
Well...
Hey, how are you?
Yeah.
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Nice job, Beesly.
You all right?
You sure?
Hey, easy, easy...
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
No, uh-
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?
No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
[approaching Michael] You have to stop this.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
Yep.
Are you... interested in her guy friends?
Okay.
Really.
Well you gotta figure this out.
Yeah!
You gotta have sex with a woman.
And a man.
And then compare.
Yep.
On what?
[looks around room nervously]
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Michael, don't.
Michael...
[interrupting] That Pam's pregnant.
Okay. Thank you.
Four months.
Nope.
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
If everyone would like to see proof.
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
I did. It was inconclusive.
Don't take it.
You can't do this.
That sounds terrible.
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]
Sure.
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
Who was that?
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
Sure.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Michael, did you say anything?
Really?
You will?  Wanna do it right now?
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
So instead, you screwed me?
No.
Hi David.
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
No, not without a 'please.'
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
Okay. And how do you feel?
All right. Did he hit you?
Did you cry?
Did you feel like crying?
I'm just gonna write 'held back tears.'
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
Michael...
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
I have noticed that we--
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
Yes.
Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
I am.
Right.
Yes, I agree.
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
You mean on a weekend?
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
Really? You just agreed to that?
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
Stanley?
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
That's not what I meant.
I disagree.
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
That's exactly what Wallace told us.
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
Hey, David. You got Jim here.
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
Nope, not at all.
Alright, thanks alot, David.
You don't have to lie.
Right.
Alright. Let's get started.
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
It's hard to tell so far.
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
You just came up with that.
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
Pro-- no favoritism.
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
Michael.
Look, you have a lot of strengths.
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
But there is a reason why I'm here!
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
[leave the conference room to address everyone]
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
Thank you, Meredith.
Rank each person individually?
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
[to camera] It's going really well, actually.
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
He's not a part of this. You know that.
Okay, your move.
Here we go.
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
I was just trying to be unbiased.
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
Six. You?
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
I just-- what?
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
What's in here?
Ooh!
We would really appreciate it.
It is really special.
Well, congrats.
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
That's nice.
Good-bye.
Yeah?
Oh, wow. That's cool.
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
Lousy Picture.
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
I know. We're pretty excited, too.
I don't like that.
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
Pretty sure everyone heard that.
Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
No.
Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
Michael.
Oh, my God. Please.
Alright.
To waiting.
I can't believe it was me.
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God. Are you serious?
[over phone] What?
[over phone] What?
[over phone] What?
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
Uh...
[over phone] And Dwight.
Pam, it just happened.
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
No. Let's talk for a long time.
That's not how that works.
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
[answers cell phone] Hey!
Is this allowed?
Wow.  You look--
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
Well we are here now, so let's just--
You look great.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
Hello?
Oscar! Uh, what is going on?
Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-
Hello?
Michael?
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
That sounds bad.
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
And then you'll be saved.
Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.
A- ah--
And you'll be saved.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
It was.
Really was.
Puerto Rico was awesome.
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
Nope.
Do we have a conversation scheduled?
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
It's a real handsome duck.
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
What?
You're messing with me.
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
What kind of car does she drive?
[expletive]
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
Oh my God.
Not now, Toby, my God!
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
No, not more than anything.
Don't call her 'the mom.'
Then take a different way home, man!
Okay, so we're good.
Frank and beans!
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
Yes, you do.
Just take the parrot.
Okay, back to the old grind.
Don't-
Sounds complicated.
[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
Really?
I was gonna go with this one.
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
Yes!  Angela!  Please...
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
Yes.
Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
Yep...
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
A wooden duck?
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
Silence.
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
Yeah... maybe.
You're not, nope.  Nope.
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Wow.
I bet we would.
Cool.
Mmm-hmm.
Who doesn't?
Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.
That is a mistake.
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
Great. See ya' then.
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
I absolutely don't understand, either.
Alright.
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
Dave.
Dave.
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
Yes, it is.
No thanks.
Mmm-hmm.
...and paper.
Nope. No.
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
I outran it.
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
No, they don't.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
See?
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
What are you doing?
No.
See what?
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
[laughing] He's alright.
Thanks Michael.
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
That's okay.
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
Pam's sales are fine actually.
Wow.
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
Definitely Grandma.
Penny for your thoughts.
Wow.
[whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.
You set the bar so high.
Okay, so--
Stop.
Hey.
Inappropriate.
All the time.
Yeah.
She wants it bad Michael.
I can.
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
I just need some time.
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
Feel better?
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
That's it.
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
OK, great.
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
OK, I'm going back to work.
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
Both.  They're both worse.
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
Michael, not now.
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
Caleb!
Today of all days...
I'll take it.
Hey David.
Oh, OK.
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
OK.
See ya.
Nothing yet.
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
Conference room everyone.
No.
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
Yeah, I want to go home.
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
The next year he really stepped things up.
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Mmm.
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
Could go either way.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
Ok.
Nah. Might as well do it now.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
Who here heard it from Ryan?
Yes.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
Hey, Ryan. How's it going?
Mmm-hmm.
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
You know what?
I think I know the problem.
I think you seem distracted.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
I am, too. Let me show you.
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
Right.
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
Hmm, sounds risky.
Wow, that's not such a bad idea.
Anything else?
Hey.  What's up?
Did you murder someone?
I think she's okay.
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
It would look bad.  Sorry.
Not much.
[laughs] Thanks Dwight.
You're creeping me out.  I'm gonna go.
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
Well, in an ideal world...
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
That's okay, I'll do it.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Dwight?
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
Okay.
Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
This is Jim.
Hey, uh David.
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
No.
I really don't know how it happened, David.
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
Yeah.  Thank you.
Yes.
See you.
See you tomorrow, Dwight.
Too loud.
Too, too loud. Too Loud.
Yeah.
This is all we have.
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
Why would you start so high?
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
No.
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
Pam!
Yes.
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
Yeah.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
I think she's doing a good job.
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.
That's what I want.
What would Bob do?
Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
Can I just talk to you for a second?
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
Yup.
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
Great!
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
What?
What?
Wait wait wait, who said that?
What?
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
Oh my God, David. That's horrible.
Oh my God!
Co-manager, actually.
Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know, I don't know.
Jerry.
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
Do it.
We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
All right.
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
What?
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
No.
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
Anybody could have walked in.
Whoa, whoa.
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
Alright.
No.
I don't think so.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
Do you even know what that means?
Um...
This is way more than I make now.
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
Hey, you got a second?
Actually, yeah.
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
Yeah!
Really.
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
Why would you do that?
Mm!
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
What is that?
Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.
Why would I wanna do that?
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
Yeah. Thank you.
Hey.
Well, the grass is always greener.
Well, it's what you wanted.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
Alright.
Yep.
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
Michael.
Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
Are you serious?  Pam.
I...  Pam, please.
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
Alright.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
No, I don't.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
Ah, you know me too well.
Yeah?  ...  Oh.
Did you say 'she?'
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
Yeah.
Alright...  Hey, did you change?
Oh.  Oh...
Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
Let's give it a shot.
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Pam.
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Hey, are you kidding me?
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Pam, I'm scared.  I'm real scared.
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
A really awesome baby.
So let's have it at the hospital.
How are we doing on contractions?
Two minutes...
Michael, I told you.
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
Alright, I have my wallet.
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
Okay, Michael!  Focus!
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
Michael, come on!
Okay.
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
Wait, you alright?
Michael, just go park the car.
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Okay.
[as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.
No, don't push.  Pull.  Pull.
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Hey, grandma's back.
Great.
Oh.  Let me get it.
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
Ready?
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
We were just kids.  What did we know?
Great.
I think we'll be okay.
Ready?  One, two, three...
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
I got it.  Alright.
Nurse!
How you doing?
Really?
Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
Alright.
It's going to be alright.
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
Oh, hi.
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?
Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
Yup.
Yeah.
Perfect.
I think she will.
We'll figure it out.
Thank you.
Please do.
What?
Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
Hmm?
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
That's amazing.
That's awesome.
that's great.
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
What?
Okay, okay.
Perfect.
Ha ha ha.
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
Half hour.
Yes, car seat's right there.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
But you hear the baby crying, right?
Uh, it's in the lot.
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
You used my move, didn't you?
Oh, thank you!
Hey... [reveal Dwight's Mega-Desk]
What do we got here?
Of course.
Hm hm.
Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta...
Morning!
No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.]
No.
No-no-no-no-no.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
It is. Big time.
Pretty amazing.
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
Is that what happened to you?
That's a common mistake.
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
What?
Right.
Yeah that's great. Great.
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
[Whispers] Please stop that!
Can you grow up?
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
[On business call] Yeah.
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
You know, can I call you back?
That would be great, thank you.
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
Okay.
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
Oh!
No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
No.
Is he you?
Where did you take that?
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Sure. That they should do one.
Who's that?
John Dillinger.
Captain Crunch.
At the Yankees game. Yeah.
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
...in your condo complex.
M. Night Shulman?
Oh, sorry, wait one second.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
You writing your name over there?
That's good. You know, with the kid.
Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...
Michael - [Michael signs] Great.
What'd you get?
Alright!
Hey.
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
Hey, alright.
Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?
I don't think you understand -
[holds up card] This one's a map.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
I love you.
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
[taps car] Lincoln.
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
Just all the - drama.
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
I have new baby pictures.
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
Didn't we kind of start it?
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
I don't think we need opposed.
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
Yes! We do. [opens box] Eclairs.
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
I made a sale.
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
Wow. [applause]
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Good one.
Absolutely, I will do that right now.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
I did not see this coming.
Okay.
Why?
You've been gone for a long time.
Easy.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Would you like to be our fourth?
All right.
So what do you think?
About Julie?
Yeah.
So you like her?
So Pam was right?
About you two hitting it off.
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
You want to just make a run for it?
What is happening?
Michael, you don't have to do this.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
It stopped.
All right.
See ya. Nice girl.
You all right?
Actually, you didn't.
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
What's up?
Dwight, don't be gross.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
[whispers] That's a good point.
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.
How are you?
All right.
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Hold on one second.
What?
None of this is time sensitive.
No.
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
What?
What was that?
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
Yeah. [chuckles]
What's that?
I don't... I don't think so.
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
She does not like him.
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
Well, the joke was on you.
It is totally insane.
Nobody's for.
Okay.
What?
Wait.
Michael. Michael.
Michael.
No.
What?
Stop what?
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
Yup. That's exactly what we did.
It's a pen.
You do?
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Oh, my God
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
Michael, no...
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
[to Pam] What?
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.
That's... not okay.
Stanley, please, this is serious!
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Exactly. It happened in Big.
I'm really too tired to do this.
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
We can order in from Hooters.
Billy Joel Rock Band.
Now you're just being hurtful.
Pam.
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Sorry about that.
Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
Excellent. Go for it.
Right? So, uh, let's uh...
Now, were those for the team?
Ah.
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
A place?
Okay.
So instead of working, you want...
Okay.
What was you? You were the leak?
Uh-huh.
Why'd you do that?
Yeah.
Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
Really?
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
No... sport.
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
Wow, that's a lot of keys.
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
Go get 'em.
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Oh, man, so many points being made.
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
You follow him on Twitter?
Pam?
I did not do this.
This is impressive.
Do they call you that?
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
Great.
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
Is there really?
Aaah!
Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
Don't beat yourself up.
Who will be watching the children?
Prove it.
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
Did something happen Dwight?
Pam?
Everything is going to be ok.
You're good... you're good at sales.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
Ok.
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
Alright.
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
Agreed.
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
Wish us luck!
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
That's it.
Stop, stop, stop.
Did you just say you remember him?
What does that mean?
Lets just go.
There it is. Alright.
That's pretty good.
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
It's my own fault-
Really?
For a lot of reasons.
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
Everything's fine.
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
Oh, my God.
Okay, this was pretty simple-
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
No, we're good. Thank you, though.
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
We could put that in orange juice.
Yeah?
Yeah!
That was like, ten years ago.
Nope, it's because it's genitalia.
Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
Good!
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
Just steer more now.
No! No!
Amazing. How do I look?
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
Phoenix Sun's point guard?
No? Nothin'?
Well, I'm neither of those things, so...
Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...[motions to lobby]
Well, by worst, you mean the best.
So, the situation is the worst.
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
Tell 'em.
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
Yeah, I thought you started it.
Ahhh.
Okay, great-
-I'm just gonna watch.
[shaking hands] How are ya?
Dwight!
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
Yes.
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
No, that's him.
Nope, not doing that.
Showtime!
No, I didn't.
Is that your office?
A what?
I think you mean The Sting.
Nope. Different movie.
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
Meredith Van Helsing?
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
You know this isn't real TV, right?
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
What do you mean?
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
Yes.
Exactly. You can do this.
Stop it! It's gonna be great.
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
Who else we got?
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
No, no, no, no...
No, no, no, no.
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
You hired him?
Did ya?
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Oh.
Dwight, please.
Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
Stop.
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
That's right.
Yikes.
Oh, no.
No. No, I'm not gonna-no.
I don't care.
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs]
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Hey.
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
Nope.
Just tell her the real reason.
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
Hey, man.
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Stop.
Elaborate.
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
Big day.
Nope.
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
[whispers to Pam] Ok, your turn.
Right now?
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
What?
Yes.
This is happening.
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
I did... say that.
Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
Hey.
Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
Yeah. [Doug walks away]
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
Scones.
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
All right. And cider.
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
Okay.
Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
I don't know, dad. I don't know.
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
A small blonde woman?
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
[baby voice] Hi.
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
[confused] Okay?
You play? [referring to keyboard]
You can't even do that.
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
Okay... [changes back to Glee]
[whispering] Hey.
I don't know about, love...
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
I don't think that's gonna...
What kind of pizza would you like?
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth]
You need to stop talking.
[unbelievingly] Okay...
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
Nope.
No.
Okay, I'm not doing every number.
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
I'm trying everything.
That's-- [ding] the password. We're in.
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev.
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
Nope.
Okay.
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything.
No.
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Talk to me.
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
Why?
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
Well, A for effort right?
Which is you.
I disagree with.
Okay, someone look it up.
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
Oh wow, these are nice.
Yeah, yeah. Totally.
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
No.
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
No politics?
Two for two, keep it up.
What do you know about boobs?
Thank you.
Show him how to use it.
It's still on a bike path though right?
What does that mean?
What?
But you didn't fail.
And you didn't fail those things either.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
Hey, it's snowing.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
You've got something on your nose.
No.
You got it.
Hey.
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Me neither. Whew.
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
[standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone]
Stop! Stop!
Oh... oh!
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
Okay... Holly's back.
Aww...
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Stop!
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Seriously!
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
I just want it to stop.
Hey, Toby.
No way.
That's increadible.
You know what's crazy?
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
Yikes. [everyone gasps]
No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
You like it?
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
Alright, my turn.
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
I mean... [speechless]
I surrender.
Anything. You got it.
You're a psychopath.
I don't want to go.
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
No, it's, it's okay. Okay.
Okay. This is it.
Go! Go! Go!
Oh.
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
Sounds good.
Smart.
Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
Was it?
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
I know.
I'm really sorry. I can't do it.
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
Hey.
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
Ohh! Good-bye.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
Was in the green group.
And that's what I told him.
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
Hey.
Pretty good.
It has been, yeah.
Sales.
[laughs]
Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
All right, good catch-up.
See ya.
All right. Bye.
Let's Go!
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
Where'd I put what?
Oh, sorry gotta go.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
And the final clue...
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
Cheer up. We made a sale.
Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...
Someone's in a bad mood.
Alright, let me turn on some music.
No you don't.
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
Hello?
Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
Ok...
What?
Oh my God.
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
Nope.
Ok. Bye.
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
Big tip.
What?
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
Shh.
Um, bottomless champagne.
No.
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
Aww, nuts. [laughs]
OOH! Boom! Face!
Did it!
Love it. Keep it goin.
Mm-hmm.
[snorts] Ew.
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
Definitely not. That's disgusting.
Hey, you don't have to...
That was really rough.
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
And a shower.
What?
No. We took a walk.
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
Three months.
Four months.
Eight months?
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
[to Michael] Why is Packer back?
What!?
You did approve it?
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
Do I have any say in this?!
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Well, I mean he humped Michael.
Yeah.
[continues working]
That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious]
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
So, this hot chocolate thing.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
I really think we should join forces on this one.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Here we go.
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
He's a jerk.
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
Oh, yikes.
How did those get out? I'm sorry.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
She's amazing. This is very exciting.
That's a guarantee.
Don't think you need the corpse then.
At a gas station. [oscar laughs]
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Totally reasonable.
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Yeah... it.s scary.
Not bad right. [swinging golf club]
[to Dwight] Nice.
Oh my God.
It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
They're probably worthless.
Leave the telescope.
Holly, will you marry me?
Congratulations!
Wait, what?
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
And what happens here is-
We were... I think she was just trying to-
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
Thank you very much.
We're back in! Right?
Yep, okay...
Okay.
No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
Stay in bed!
Having a great time.
Thanks, yeah.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
Who's gonna see us?
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
I think I'm gonna go.
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
[shaking head at the camera]
Nope, go back to the script.
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Didn't I?
I gotta go do this.
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
That did. Pretty huge laugh.
And impressions!
You gotta play along man.
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
You sure?
Did you break the shredder Kevin?
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
Alright.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
[chuckles] You got it.
Hey!
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
Careful.  There is no inner circle.
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
That's Toys R Us, I think.
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
Seriously?
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, you got a second?
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
Oh.  Like nobody.
It was --
That's awesome.
Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
Oh yeah, did he text us?
He didn't text me.  [Andy's phone chimes]
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Yeah.
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
Well, there is no inner...circle.
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
Why not?
Alright, there you go.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Okay.
Fantastic.
Yup.
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Erin.
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Nope. Baskets have it.
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Wait...
I'm coming.
You'd slow me down.
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
You define foment.
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
And the desk.
Okay.
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
You wouldn't dare.
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
[quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Yep.
Hey, Dwight. What's up?
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
He never called a meeting.
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Really?
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
You could just be saying it to get the job.
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Okay.
Did you just trademark that...
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Yes.
Yes.
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Andy? You all set?
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
[to Gabe] Is it?
Your department's just you, right?
Good!
Yeah.
Peepa.
Great.
No.
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.
Yikes.
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Okay.
Thank you.
Great.
I'm sure it's fine.
Howard Cline?
[checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
That's very...
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Uh--
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
No, was it good?
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
What is it?
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
[looks astonished] Ohhhh!
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Um... why Kelly?
Okay.
Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
No.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
All right. Name.
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Yes.
Thank you, Dwight.
Well, that was quick.
He's not a real candidate.
You took the deal.
That's not okay.
What is happening right now?
No, why would you think that?
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Thank you.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
[while sighing] I suppose I am.
Yes.
Okay.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
What? No, no, it's not a vote.
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
Oh, yeah. Pregnant.
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
No one should be planking at all.
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
It���s, it���s nothing.
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
Left.
Why are you- How do you know?
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
I don���t think it���s-
That���s not it.
Mmum, still wrong.
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
Nope. No dog video.
Okay. See you guys.
Uhhh, the street?
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
Right.
Yeah, she does like Elmo.
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
Shhh.
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
Ryan? A little help?
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
Good. What? Nothin'
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
Come on, man.
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
Alright.
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
How many L to a K?
I���ll take five.
Your ex-wife?
Wow. Alright. Can���t wait to meet her.
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim���s desk, kicking things in the process.]
Why don���t you start?
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
We know that.
You have a walking buddy.
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
But, what if?
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
Ok.
Andrew.
No, I didn���t notice anything.
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Gettin��� psyched up?
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
Absolutely not.
Pull up your pants.
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
1870's...
Nope, he means tuna dog.
Do Snowboarders hate animals?
Dwight! At least aim it.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Nice job.
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
Which ideally would be me....
Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
I'd go with that.
Not that, don't...
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
Our fake winnings
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
A...hot chocolate tea
Kevin Costner.
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
So, it's not the dumbest idea.
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
Is he OK?
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
That's alright.
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
That's OK, we're good.
Porque es muy rapido.
Right. It's city and country combined.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
But what are you gonna do about that?
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
Dammit Dwight!
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
Whoa whoa whoa!
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
Good.
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
You've seen it, right?
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
Okay, don't be gross.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
No.
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
Closing ceremonies.
I think I left my wallet in your house.
Right here.
Keys, keys...
I didn't forget them, they're right here.
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
Whoo.
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
I don't know if I can.
Alright.
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
Hey.
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
[laughs] It���s called Ghostbusters.
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
You know that���s���
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
[to Dwight] Are you serious?
That���s funny.  Ok.
[whispering] Thank you.
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
Thank you.
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
Ok.
Oh, come on!
Pink is the red-
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
Oscar, how are you on that side?
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
[On phone] ...W R K.
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
Is that off again?
Ok.
Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
Dwight, question.
If this doomsday device goes off...
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
Ok.
Nope.
Hmm���Heda. [alert] No.
Ok, where is he?
I'll try both.
Robert.
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
You up for a game?
Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.
Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
Oh, oh yeah.
Yes. Right now? Yes.
Here you go. [throws it over glass]
Awww, sorry. Did it break?
You sure?
What kinda iPhone is that?
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
I'm alright.
Yep.
Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow]
Yeah. That does not feel good.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
I wasn't here that day.
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
Ok, this is crazy.
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
No? Come on.
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
Hmm. Doubt it.
What���s that?
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
Hey.
Yeah. Super pretty.
The temp?
Nope.
And I'm telling you, I don't.
No, I don't.
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
Oh, I stand corrected.
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
Mm-hmm.
Not his mom's car.
Touche?
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
Dwight!
Dwight! Dwight!
[to Cathy] Sorry about that.
Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?
Leave.
Mm-hmm?
[laughs] Told you.
You okay?
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
Stop shoving me.
[to Pam] Really?
Si.
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
No.
I am not lying.
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
Yeah, but I don't smoke.
I don't know.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
Okay.
Oh my God!
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
How do you feel?
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
Only two hundred dollars?
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
What are you talking about?
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
They���re terrible.
Tuna?
And to drink?
Oh-ho, I am in.
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
It's locked.
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
We didn't have one scheduled.
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Because you���re sitting?
Ok.
Because you���re sitting?
You know I have to do this.
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
Oh, wow. So cute.
Very cute. [holds out the phone]
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
Oh boy.
Do I?
[mutters] I know, I do.
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Perfect!
Yes?
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
Yes. All right. Great. [leaves]
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
She's not your grandmother, is she?
Yeah.
It wasn't me.
Kathy wants to leave our clump?
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
What was that?
Can't do that.
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
Hmm...
Nice try, this is ridiculous.
Three times.
Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
And what's it's name?
Oops. [hangs up]
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
Yes. It is.
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
I don't-
Yeah.
O...K.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
You alright, Santa?
Yes.
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
OK.
Alright. I will definitely do that.
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
Yes. They totally do.
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
Cathy wants to leave our clump?
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
That's ok.
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
Okay, done.
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
You can write a book about chairs.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
Stop right there. I love it.
In Philadelphia.
That's a great idea.
Yeah.
All right, good stuff.
I thought it was a fun idea.
Okay.
There's a table over here.
Shawn Marion.
Wrong, for so many reasons.
Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
[claps] All right.
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
I know.
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
All right-
I must...
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
Really? Why?
Good night.
To both these bears.
To madness.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
Are you serious?
And there's my talking point.
To the shame room! [raises bottle]
Hey.
Okay.
Yeah.
It was pretty uneventful, actually.
Uh, hit and run.
Nope. Not guilty.
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Okay.
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
Wow, I'm really sorry.
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, wait, wait.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
No.
No.
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Uh-
The empanada guy!
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
Because my car broke down.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
[to Cece] You want a giraffe?
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
Split the difference?
Okay, let's go.
What?
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
That was a great idea.
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
I don't know what else we can do here.
It's okay.
All right, all right. Okay.
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
Cece!
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
I know, I know.
I'm gonna grab her, okay.
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
It's not really food, right?
Ok, ok, ok.
���And shove it up my butt.���
I'm not gonna eat it.
I'm not-
[on phone] They hate me, Pam.
No, it's bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....
It's a lunch thing.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
Nope. It's over.
Nope. OK.
Ooh, me three.
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
���Robert, Hey!��� Exclamation point.
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
Yeah, it's a golf text.
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Ok, sending.
Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
I think you're right.
Total nightmare.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
Essential.
Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
Mosquito.
So, what is this special project?
That sounds awesome.
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
Bye.
I will.
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
Puppet.
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Yes.
Loggins and Messina.
Man.
Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
I would love to hear the other mottos.
No way.
It was-
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
Okay.
True love's kiss.
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
Wow. Are you that bored?
Is that another motto?
Mmm.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
Oh, I don't know.
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
No one's moving!
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
You haven't done any of the research.
Stanley, are you listening to music?
You are bleeding through your shirt.
Catching butterflies.
Theater.
Dragging.
Dragging sticks.
Talla-nasty', very clever.
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
How many buttons do you have?
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Hey, how's it going?
Uh��� yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
Okay.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
Yes, nice. Good word association
Yup, coming. [opens door] All right.
We have plenty.
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
No, no, no, Stanley.
Stanley. Stanley.
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
In the bed.
Brown, shiny, painful bite.
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
Yeah.
I know.
Ow.
Just check it.
Alright.
He knows what he's doing.
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
Oh.
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Come on.
You know what? Maybe they just ate.
Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
Is that really how you want to get this job?
Okay, Dwight��� Dwight��� Dwight, Dwight Dwight!��� uh���
Hmm? No.
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
um��� I mean-
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
[Jim Face]
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Cathy, go.
Awesome.
Right there! [points to Cathy]
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
Nice job, I think you got 'em.
[Jim face]
Oh yeah? What's the first best?
[whispers] Is that Nellie?
Which Spice Girl?
Okay.
Come on, man.
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
I���m very sorry.
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Dwight.
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
About ten minutes.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
Uh...
okay.
I���m not doing the Presentation.
Okay, I���ll do it.
A costume?
I���ve been in here for 20 seconds.
I���m not wearing eyeliner.
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
Oh.
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
Yeah. ��Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
[attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight.
Well, he's Florida's problem now.
What's that?
I thought you liked the store?
Thank you.
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
[enters room] All right. There he is.
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
You know, I just think you should know that-
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
I tried. He will not listen.
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
OK. All right.
[enters abruptly] Dwight.
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
Yes.
Dwight, please.
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
Dwight, come o-
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
Gross!
What? What, what, what, what, what?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, I forgot.
You all right? You ok?
What are you doing?
Get up.
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
This is dangerous.
Why?
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
Hey.
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
Wow. It���s the end of an era.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
Nellie
What brings you to town?
No, that's Andy's office.
Can't you do something about this?
-Right.
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
Any luck?
[on phone] Andy?
Andy, where are you?
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Dwight, should she be our manager?
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
The raise isn't real.
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
Yes.
Oh, god, nature, please.
[exhales sharply]
Was that not the--
Mm-hm.
Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.
No. I would've said no.
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
Yes.
No.
She dies.
Let's see it. Show of hands.
All right, guys, stop.
How?
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
Why is she here?
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
That was one time-
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Sounds like every other party.
Oh! Hire a magician.
Trust me.
Yes, you should.
[reads] 'Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.'
I doubt that they're sh-
Whoa. Who is this guy?
Boyfriend.
Like a boyfriend?
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
Shh!
Dwight!
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
No, that's not what I-
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
No. No.
Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.
I'll do it.
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Night-night.
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
Hey, come on.
And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan]
That's it.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
That's about it, yeah.
Um...
What happened?
Couple of times.
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
I was very drunk.
Wow, what are we talking about?
Hey, hey. Okay.
Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.
Not at all, can we go?
Second line.
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
Uh, Ryan can never know.
Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
Well, I second that emotion.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Tickets are 250 bucks.
Paul Anka.
Okay, you could just show up late though.
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Wait, what? Come on!
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
What happened, did he do it?
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Look at that one though, he's smiling!
Yes--
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Yeah
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
You���re welcome.
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
All right, easy there, grandpa.
Okay. You don���t need my help?
All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Thanks Janet.
Wow, simultaneous sale.
Screw ���em.
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Hey, hey, come on, language.
In the fridge.
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
Robert?
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
Damn it.
It���s a monkey.
Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
Is that him?
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
Dwight!
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Are you sure?
Brace yourself. 3��� 2���
1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]
You all right?
Ah! [Harry walks in]
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
What are you talking about?
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
God!
What?
Big Red Paper Company?
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
But you���re saying there���s a chance.
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
That sounds lovely.
I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
How's it going, man?
Great, yeah, good.
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Pam? No!
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Nope.
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
Nope.
That's-
That's-
Okay.
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Alright. Why don't you just-
-give him to me and... perfect.
This is great.
Excuse me.
Just do it.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Let's do it, shoot it.
Great.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, so that's it?
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Oh boy.
Andy, come on.
Hey.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
Oh, yeah
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
An Altima or better.
we good?
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
Done. Explain.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
The new guys called one.
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
You a sports fan?
Oh. Any team sports?
Phillies fan, though, right?
No, like baseball. A baseball team.
Ok. Good talk.
I have nothing in common with Plop.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
[to Pam] A banana?
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
[to camera] Just��� so weird.
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
OK.
Uh, my ex-fianc��.
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
Thanks for inviting us, by the way-
That was, that was a surprise.
You're welcome.
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
Gravel company?
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
Yeah, you never know.
OK, Kenny.
He plays piano?
Definitely.
Courtside seats. Sixers.
It was an away game.
No.
[laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
You heard that one.
That I thought we were millionaires.
That's all right.
You all right? [Oscar nods]
Ready?
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
Uh-huh.
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Uh... [looks at Pam]
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
That was really good, Darryl.
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
You doing alright, man?
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
No, I'm serious. There's always something better.
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
Right?
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
Right?
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
I deserved that.
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
I think I got it right here.
You got it.
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
Getting my wife a week off from work.
Awesome, right? [leaves]
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
���..breast pain...���
Oof. ���Infertility.���
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
What?
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
What?
What?
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
Just...you good?
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Andy!
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Next stop: Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also.
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
You got it.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
He's fine. He's indestructible.
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
What do we want?!
When do we want it?!
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
What are you doing?
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
What?
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
No.
I'll take it.
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
That doesn't matter.
Ok...that's not...
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
It's pretty good actually.
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
Don't..
Don't..
[Group chants along] Pie! Pie! Pie!
We did it.
It won���t budge.
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
It���s Okay.
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
You���re the best.
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
Shut up.
Wow.
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool.
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
I did, yeah.
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
Ten. It was the full ten.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
Yeah.
What is it?
Um, oh man, I don���t actually know.
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
You weren���t there.
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
Pam.
We���ll talk about it later.
I thought that concert was pretty great.
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
Uh...
Okay. We���ll, just forget it.
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
Competent.
Dwight!
No, you chose yourself.
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
[In staff meeting] See these forms...
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
Hi, David.
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
I can���t. I have the thing.
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
Yeah, I���m here. Are we all on?
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
I uh, I have some ideas, actually...
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
I���m gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Okay, I���ll call you right back.
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
Nobody!
No, no, no.
Jim Halpert.
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
[laughs]
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
What? Yeah, right. As if.
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
This is gonna be awful.
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
Yep.
Oh, great.
Because we���re friends.
Unfair. When���s my birthday?
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
All right.
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
Tell me about it.
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that���s-- that���s decorative.
Still decorative.
No.
Don���t-- don���t-- don���t pole people with knives.
Phyllis! ��Wow.
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
Done, right?
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
Right.
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
Whoo!
Yeah, I think so.
Uh--
Best Christmas ever.
Thank you.
Can't wait.
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
So happy right now.
Yes, he is finally nigh.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
Oh, it's like naughty or nice.
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
Damn.
Ooh.
Oh, you know what? I gotta go.
Yeah, it's all right.
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
Ooh.
That's right.
Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.
You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
Ooh! Are you nuts?
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
Just--Just--Hey!
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
Aah! Ow!
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
I'm probably never gonna see you again.
Okay, sorry, sorry.
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
I'll call you when I get in.
All right.
Love you.
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Right?
Hey, of course.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
Go get 'em.
I think they're going to the conference finals.
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
I bit my lip at lunch today.
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
Ok
Thanks!
Love you too. Bye.
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
You gotta be kidding me.
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
I love it.
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
And that's all?
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
Sorry, Stinky, can���t do it. Too busy.
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Hey, I���m in Philadelphia right now.
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
What are you doing here?
That���s so great!
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?
Let���s do it!
Mm-hm
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
I don���t.
Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
Hey.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
Yeah. Even you.
Bye, Dwight.
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
Hey. I was just about to call you.
I am still in Philly, actually.
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
Hey.
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
We���ll talk tomorrow?
Okay. I���ll talk to you tomorrow.
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
I���m just gonna call you back. Thanks.
I���m sure he���s just nervous.
Sure, yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
I knew it, I knew it.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
How is it my fault?
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
Oh. Um���
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
Yes, okay. Bye.
No, thanks.
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
Too much now.
That seems inconsiderate.
All right. I think that went well.
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
I���ll call you when I get there.
All right.
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
[in Darryl and Jim's Philly apartment] Hey.
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
I'm couching it!
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Yeah!
Nice job, man.
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
No big deal.
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
Hey.
Yeah. Totally.
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
I don't think you had to.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
That's not the point.
No, I'm not making bread.
Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
It's all good. Are we all good?
What's that cooler?
Oh, crap. Were those yours?
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
Oh. Oh!
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
They are terrible.
Oh my god. That's so romantic.
Oh my god. That's less romantic.
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.
What?
Oh.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
What?
Crying?
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
I just feel like we're gonna fight.
So... how 'bout let's not?
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
Yeah, yeah.
No problem.
You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
You look great.
Yeah.
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
Hey, how'd the interview go?
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
Alright, love you.
Hey! Back here.
Si, senor.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Alright. So, tell me all about it.
Tell me about the cologne. How much?
You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
Austin Powers.
Ferris Bueller.
Not Night at the Roxbury.
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
It's fascinating.
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
So, next interview has to be better.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
My condolences.
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
OK.
Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
Oh man. [laughs]
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
Ok great.
Bye.
Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert.
Let's go to the conference room.
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
Right? [laughs]
Yep.
Wow.
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
OK
Space dust.
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Ok, great.
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
Smart.
���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.���
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
We'll look into it.
We gotta get him.
We're gonna go get him.
We're gonna get him.
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
It���s a little, uh, personal.
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
That���s all right.
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
Mm-hmm.
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
What do you mean?
That���s kind of an impossible question.
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
Mmhm.
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
I guess I will swallow my truth.
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
Thanks.
Bye.
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
I love you.
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
It���s great.
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
Beesly! Oh, my god.
Ah, definitely blue.
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
Smasher!
Fireball!
That���s pretty good. I feel safe.
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
What?
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
Oh, wow. But, um���Oh, I get that.
I get it.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
Again.
Not at all. It should be Dwight.
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
If you could help me out, that would be���
Anything would help.
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
Wow, that���s���
You come so prepared. Aspirin.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
Wow, hey.
What���s up?
Okay.
Really?
Yeah, totally you did.
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
All right? I���m gonna wait.
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
Look who���s back.
Weeknights are actually tough just because���
That���s true, yeah.
[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.
So.
Let���s hear it.
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
What kind of offer?
What?
Oh, my god!
Wow, that is��� wow.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
Oh, man. Yeah, I can���t do it.
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
I know. And I can���t do it.
Sales form for you to sign.
Aw, thanks, man.
No.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
Yeah.
I will. I will.
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
He welcomes you.
Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Potential future nonsense.
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Exactly.
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
Nothing.
Members of the office, hear ye.
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
He envies you.
Alright.
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
985,000,000,000,017.00
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
Come on.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
Do you want a corn dog?
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
Uncanny.
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
Look at that form.
Uncanny. [everyone applauds]
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
Is-
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
Hey.
You all right? What���s going on?
Yes, I���m happy.
Yeah.
What?
Pam.
This was my decision, not yours.
You didn���t force me.
You did not force me to do this.
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Resent you?
Is that really what you think?
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
Perform a test.
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
Unless you think he can���t handle it.
All right.
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
What do we got?
Wow! Congratulations, that���s a really big step.
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
[whistles] That���s a lot of pros.
So what is the problem?
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
Love.
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
Not as good as you.
You got it.
You watched it.
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
Umm���.
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
Hey man, good to see you.
Hey!
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
And Jim will say nothing.
Yeah?
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
Get out.
No, Dwight. You���ll be doing the whacking.
Of course I did.
Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.
Private Room.
Enjoy, enjoy.
Okay, man, easy.
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
They think it was Mose.
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
Is that Mose?
Ooh.
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
Okay, just talk.
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or���
Right.
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
O-Kay.
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
You ready?
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
Best prank ever.
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
I gotta get out of this dress.
What���s going on?
No, really, what���s going on?
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
That���s why it���s so clean.
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
Oh��� okay. Where would we go?
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
The last���
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
You wanna do this?
You really want to do this?
[hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!
Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]
[whispering to Pam] Let���s go outside
You know what? Maybe we should talk.
Athleap.
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
Hey, and if you���re ever in Austin...
There it is.
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
Thanks Phyl.
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
