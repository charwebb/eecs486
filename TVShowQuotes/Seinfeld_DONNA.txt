Thanks again for the movie.
Id invite you up, but the place is being painted.
Unless you want to go to your place.
Values are very important.
Thursdays great.

Really? I like that commercial.
Yeah, its clever.
Yeah, thats the one.
I dont know. I like the, guys.
Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.
(annoyed) Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants.
Thats the point.
No one is telling you to like it.
Never?
Thats amazing.
Is there anything else about you I should know?
Really?
Wait, wait. Hes in the bathroom.
You dont have to leave.
Yes.
Im Donna.
He told you about that?
(to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.
You told him how I like the commercial.
Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends.
I dont like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.
I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.
Dont bother, Im leaving.
I dont wanna hear it.
Jerry.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I'm Donna Chang...
I mean I'm Donna Chang.
Did you think I was Chinese?...
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
Used to be "Changstein."
No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.
Ridiculous.
Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) I'm Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before.
She was trying to call you, but--
(pause) George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
It's Donna Chang.
Hi.
Helllo...
(to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!
She said you should come too.
Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone)
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
Yeah.
You must be Estelle.
I'm Donna Chang!
...No.
I'm from Long Island.
I'm sorry...?
Hi.
No it's not. (the coat)
No, what are you talking about.
Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...
Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it
