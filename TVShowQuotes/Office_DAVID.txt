Nice to meet you.
OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...
Thanks very much.
OK, Michael.
Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?
You understand this is a very serious situation.
You made a joke?
Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
Good. [Michael leaves office]
Jan, glad you could make it.
Of course I do.
About 5,000.
I don't know
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
Sure.
God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael?
[on phone] Michael, I am calling---
Jan is out of town right now.
Michael?
Michael?
Michael?
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
That's not necessary.
Yes.
[confused] Oh, Michael?
Isn't our interview tomorrow?
You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
In the middle of a work day?
Okay.
We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
I don't think so.
I believe we put you in charge.
Okay, Michael.
I'm really looking forward to our interview.
Michael, good to see you!
Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Okay.  And your strengths?
Oh.  Yes.  Very good.
Very good.
What do you think we could be doing better?
Okay!
Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
You're back together.
Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
No, we're letting Jan go.
Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
...what do you think about Michael Scott?
This is off the record.
Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
It's not.
It's not.
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
No, we're not giving you the job.
I do.
Yes.
I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You're clearly a very bright guy.
Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
...that's a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads 'Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous!  Pam'  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up...
How do you think you function here in New York?
You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
[on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I'm so glad.  We're all very excited you're going to be joining us.  It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.
Where do you see yourself in ten years?
A... multivitamin?
Michael. I am very sorry.
Yeah?
Thanks, Michael.
Michael, is everyone okay?
I don't understand, is anyone hurt?
Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.
All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?
Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
Okay, I have to go.
No.
Not without cause, Michael.
You have to get along with Toby.
Yep.
Goodbye, Michael. [hangs up]
[on speakerphone] Michael.
Is this why you're calling me?
Okay.
You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?
Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.
What say we do.
It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.
Yes.
Yeah.
[opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.
Hi Michael how are you?
So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor [Michael makes exaggerated oh-my-gosh face at camera]. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.
There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
Look, this is important, Michael.
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
Good work.
Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy.
Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.
[on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?
Fine. What is going on?
Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
How could you not know Michael?
Might have hi--- OK, what firm?
Michael?
Was it the sales department?
Was it Jim?
OK, was it Dwight?
That's too bad.
Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]
I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping]
Alright Dwight. This is huge.
This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
Yeah?
You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
[on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
No. No dogs.
[on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?
No, no.
[same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
I am gone.
What gave you that idea?
I see.
Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.
I'll give it my best shot, Michael.
No.
[coming out from bathroom] Michael.
How did you get here, Michael?
Ok.
Michael. Listen-
Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
That's not exactly-
No.
Yes.
We didn't ask you to do that.
Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
What?
A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
Hmmm.
Uh.
You know, I just want to address everyone first.
Hi, everyone.
Hi.  Uh, look it's no secret--
Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
Okay?
I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?
Hmm.
I find that extraordinarily surprising.
We'll bring them both in.
Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
Yeah, yeah.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?
Yeah.
Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
$12,000.00
Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
Yeah.
I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
No.
Uh, you already have a new receptionist--
Pam's not a salesperson.
Okay.  Please continue.
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Your company cannot be worth that much.
Michael--
Okay.  Deal.  Okay?
Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]
[playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Yeah.
Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
Dwight.
Okay.
Okay, I will look at it Monday.
Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?
No, ah it's okay Michael.  We got it.
Yeah.
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.
Cheese platter?
Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  You've given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak.
Thank you Jim.
Erin, is Michael around?
Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.
What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
Please do.
I thought you liked Jim?
[reading performance report]  'Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.'
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
Mmhmm.
Ummm... okay, here's the thing though.  The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
[on phone] This is David.
Yep.
So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?
Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier.
Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file.
Michael, I really don't know what's going on [police sirens in background] down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?
Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.
Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone's on board.
We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything.  If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?
Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet.
But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well... You know what?  I'm sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?
You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.
Thanks Jim.
Michael.
So glad you could make it.
How was the ride?
I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.
Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe.
It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.
[over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.
What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.
There is no plan.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael.
Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.
Yes.
Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?
Am I missing something?
Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion.
Uh, hey, I'm sorry.  I'm taking this out on you.
It's been crazy here.  You know I think you're doing a great job, right?
Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?
Okay.
Yes Michael, what is so urgent?
I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
Michael...
Michael-
This is a very very bad time.
Stephanie, can you hop off please?
Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.
I'll be fired.
Alan will be out too. All of us.
Goodbye Michael.
Hey Sweetie, what is it?
What the hell?
Michael, I have never-
Ever, ever...
Hello everyone.
You weren't supposed to tell anyone Michael.
I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know.
Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.
No! No, and congratulations.
Michael.
No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
You look great.
You hungry? I'm just having lunch.
Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in.
Keep it up, son.
Yeah.
Things not going so well there?
I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.
Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.
I don't know. I mean, what can you do?
I, I - It's a tough one.
I don't have any ideas for you there.
Hey, oh, okay. Wait.
I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. [imitates vacuum] Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. [sucking noise] Picks it up!
No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
You-you don't like it.
No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?
It'll be ok.
Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
Suck it. That's what it's called.
Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it.
Oh, Michael.
Thank you for coming.
[singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah! Teddy!
[laughing] What you doing?
You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
Yeah big time, yeah.
Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li [bleep].  That's what it sounds like.
Herrow! Herrow!
You can't do that these days. You can't.
No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh.
Where are you working?
Any jobs now?
Just let me know.
All right.
Andy Bernard!
How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
[opens door] Andy Bernard.
Um��� I���m in the middle of a piano lesson.
Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now��� why would I want that? It���s worth half of what it was three years ago.
Why don���t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
Hey guys, long time.
Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
Yes, as we've discussed-
But it's very possible-
Probable.
Yep.
There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
Well, okay. Great to meet you.
Pleasure.
That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
[on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.
Jim, good! You should hear this too.
Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They���ve apparently just dropped the supplier they���ve been with for the last ten years. .
Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It���s someone new but she didn���t catch her name.
Good luck!
[on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there���s a crisis -- the more I think about it --
They did?
Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.
Really? [reading from phone] ���Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.���
���By the way, Oscar says 'hi'���
Andy.
Andy!
Watch it Andy!
My wife?
Yeah?
Has it?
Shh.
Andy.
Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.
No.
I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.
We are even...now. Understand? Got it?
You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
