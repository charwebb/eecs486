(What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?
How do you read?
Mike Lubika?
No, no, no. I mean authors.
Name a couple.
Art Vandelay?
What has he written?
I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?
She did.
You're fired.
I want you out of here by the end of the day.
Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.
To your promotion.
Well, you're really on your way now.
Kramer. Come in.
Uh, Ya, Have a seat.
Ya, thank you.
The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh "Regis and Kathy Lee" the other day and -
An-Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didn't do any more of these shows.
Kramer, I'm sorry.
It's out -
Kra-Kramer, I -
Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaine's desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.
I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.
Well I'm not bad. Not bad.
I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.
If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?
So you just eat the tops.
Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!
Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.
You want a muffin or not?
Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.
You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.
What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?
Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?
So what do we with the bottoms?
That's a good idea.
No. No. It is.
No no, we just thought...
What is this guy again?
What is going on here?
