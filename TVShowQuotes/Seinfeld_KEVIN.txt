I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.
Besides, anyone can do it.
Not at all.
Elaine, you've changed my life.
I got a vasectomy this morning.
I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
What was that?
This is! Oh boy, I always do this.
Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.
Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!
Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
Yeah!
Y'think?
Friends?
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"
(grabs it) No. You got it last time.
(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)
Read!
Hey! Elaine! Hi-i! Over here!
Sure. (strolls away with his friends)
(Here ya are.)
Who is it?
(unlocks, opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her)
Come on in!
(friendly) Just reading..
Hey.. What're you doing?
Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it?
(drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey.
Hi.
(testy) Hello, Vargus..
Ya wanna catch a ballgame this weekend?
Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So?
All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
(enthused) Fourth row, center.
Oh, so what did you do?
Nice. (doorbell rings) Who is it?
(smiles, relieved) Hold on.
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.
(eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
