... flared nostrils?
Nope, haven't seen him.
The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...
Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.
Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?
Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo.
There is no small. Small is Medium.
Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo.
That's medium.
There is no small. [flash of perky inspiration] Child-size is small.
Adult.
[chuckling] Not usually.
Do you want butter?
[perkily] It's butter-*flavored*!
[perkily] It's yellow!
Oh, I'm very sorry.
You poor thing!
You're a good friend.
Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.
Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.
I know! But it happens.
That would be $387 round-trip.
Yes.
Next.
Uh, what are you returning?
Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... "A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...
Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49.
Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.
That'll be $98.00.
That's what I said. $98.00.
46?
47!
You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
That, Cinnamon Babka.
There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.
49?
Thatll be 13.05
A hundred? I can't change that.
What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
You got to buy more than that.
Not enough.
Keep going.
6.75.
You have to take a number.
58!
(coughing and coughing, getting really bad)
Here you are. (hands Elaine the cake box)
Can I help you guys with anything?
Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout.
All right guys, take it outside.
You're paying for these.
Can I getca anything else?
How about a nice box of "scram".
Uh, this is out. Someone has it.
Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.
Oh, sorry. We can't do that.
I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.
Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...
Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)
What's your name again?
(checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.
Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.
(Noticing George with the rocking chair) Excuse me. Can I help you?
Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?
Evan Fayne.
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
Yes?
What project?
You're gonna have to fill me in.
(blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here.
Well, maybe I will.
(on phone) Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh, there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project?
(on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh, I see. (listens) Interesting. (listens) Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you.
(apologetically) Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home.
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.
(upset) Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to humiliate me about it, alright!
Hi.. May I help you?
Ohh! Well...Congratulations
When 's the wedding?
Oh! Well, we have quite a few to pick from ( turns around and picks up a huge binder) They're arranged in order of price , the most expensive are in the front.
Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years. I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check.
Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.
Okay, have you been in here before?
Right, how did that all work out?
Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.)
Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky.
I thought you said you wanted to be out?
You've really lost a lot of hair.
Here you Mr. Costanza.
Looks real, doesn't it?
Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good.
Then you better get a camera.
