(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
George. Jerry, Stacey.
So, how was your trip to Berlin?
Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
You, know my boyfriend went.
Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
Let me tell you what I think.
Are you very fussy about your pants?
Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
Never came back.
It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
No thanks.
Well I wouldn't move in because...
Well because...
Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
I should be going.
No thanks.
I should be going.
Yes. (She exits)
So they just leave?
Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
I'll get some ice.
Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
You know, the apartment.
Well what if it was my apartment?
Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
Maybe I should get going.
Let's slow it down a little.
Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..
You're okay with that, right?
So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
Alright, then. Good night.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Yes.
Yes.
I do. I'm ready.
I know how difficult this must have been for you.
What do you mean?
Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!
