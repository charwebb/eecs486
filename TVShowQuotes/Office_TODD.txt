I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
[shaking Holly's hand] Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
After you!
[excitedly] Oh!
It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!
Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.
well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
Is too!
Check it out!
[grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don't even watch, Halpert!
Hey what's going on you guys? [walking into the kitchen with Holly, Dwight, and Kevin, with whom he fist bumps] Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused]
Since when did you learn how to read?
Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
[to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right?
That's sweet. How's the sex?
Why?
I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. [winks]
[at Hank's with Michael, talking to Hank] And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that. [Hank smiles]
Why?
Holly said that?
She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.
Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.
Don't give up on me.
I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
Well thanks, will do.
That sounds weird.
Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd.
[walking into Michael's office] You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the 'ass', in Tallahassee!
Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
Do you have a ball and chain?
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.
I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.
It's gonna be so good.
Uh, it doesn���t include headshots.
No.
