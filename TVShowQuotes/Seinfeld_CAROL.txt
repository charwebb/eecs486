Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.
So, wadda ya' think? Do you love her?
So how do you think she looks like?

Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to come see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
Let's take a picture. Michael, get the camera.
It's in the bottom draw' of are dressa'. Hurry up!  He's such an idiot.
A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)
Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee!
Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.
Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)
Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away)
Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.
How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?
And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?
Oh, just look at him!
Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.
I'm gonna get him.
(Entering with baby) Here he is.
George, thanks so much for making breakfast.
...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!
Elaine, you gotta have a baby!
The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
Oh! I have pictures!
Look at him! Just look at him!
Alan?!
Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?
That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him.
