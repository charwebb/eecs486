Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.
Here's my card.
Nice meeting you.
(howling with laughter) Stop it, you're killing me!!
Would you like to join us?
Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.
Oh? What happened?
Was he Chinese?
Is your last name Benes?
Ping is my cousin!
I'm handling his case!
That's right!
Yeah, I know!
Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.
Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.
I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.
You're a very serious person, aren't you?
I understand.
I think it's curdled.
Do you ever laugh?
That's so sad. What do you do?
Hi.
Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.
I'm very attracted to him.
He never said anything funny.
No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.
So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
I gotta go.
Please don't.
I thought he was dark and disturbed.
Hello!
It was really nice meeting you.
Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.
How about this?
Oo.
Ha hea.
It's delicious.
Non-fat?
No.
