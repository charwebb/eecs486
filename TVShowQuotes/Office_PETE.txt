That, is awesome!
Oh yeah.
I think this is better.
This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun!
Nice to see you again, Pam.
Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?
Hey, just having fun Jimmy.
Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?
Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.
I'm just calling it like I see it.
It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.
That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.
Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--
You know what? Never too married for a noogie.
Smoking.
A little mo' cardio.
Douche.
No thank you. My name���s Pete.
Pete!
What? Why?
No I���m not.
Sure, boxing, tennis.
NASCAR. The Amazing Race.
You mean horses?
Ah, I like the Red Sox. I���m from Vermont.
I don���t want it, really.
I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
Well, I���m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.
Why are you getting rid of it?
Your husband?
Really? I got something?
[sarcastically] Yay, another person yelling at me.
That���s really nice.
[referring to the letter] It���s open.
[whispering] OK.
Uh, is it Duncan?
No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them.
Seems unnecessary for an audition.
That Clark, huh? Errr [punches palm] Ca!
[whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.
The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.
Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera.
Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera]
Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied.
Yeah, whatever you say, boss.
Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.
Hey Erin!
Oh���okay. Sorry.
Fonas chek!
Oh sorry! Sorry.
I don't think that's Nelly.
I didn���t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
What?
Fax?
Cool. He's like 40 though, right?
Awesome. Have fun.
Hey. She's back.
Yeah, no problem. How was it?
Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk.
Yeah, he is.
Ok.
Yeah.
Okay, call down. It���s just me, not Tom Selleck.
Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It���s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
[sound effect of throwing ball]
Erin, did this call...
What?
Oh, I���m sorry. It���s for the thing.
Wow.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they���re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information���s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to ���chillax,��� and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don���t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. ��Fight the power.
That���s the idea.
Well, I���ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
Will do.
Kevin, I can hear you.
This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ���sausage factory.���
All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
All right.
There we go.
Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex.
There you go.
Hey, hey, hey, it���s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That���s what this tower���s all about -- ��mistakes. Okay, if you���re afraid of screwing up, the tower���s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That���s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let���s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?
There we go. All right, let���s do it.
All right. Check it out.
Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!
Can you hand me a card?
What?
Did she buy it?
See ya later, Heymont.
Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
For insulting a client���s recently deceased mother.
Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
yeah. That���s-- that is terrible.
I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
Die hard reference.
You haven't seen die hard?
Why haven't you seen die hard?
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.'
Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.
Oh, that's okay, bud.
Common mistake.
My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
Hear what?
You don't like flying, do you?'
No, that's the--
Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--'
That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
Hey. Everything okay?
Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] 'After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--'
Or we can just sit and talk, though.
I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
Okay.
Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?
Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
Oh, yeah, of course. I know.
Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man.
[putting mayo on Erin's head] How's that?
Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
Okay.
No, it actually  feels kinda nice.
Hey, did Erin already take off?
Okay.
Hey, look who it is!
[to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? You���re like the new office administrator.
What?
Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ���Like��� Derek���s ���Likes.���
Oh, check it out. This is our first real ���Like.���
Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific.
Yeah.
Yes.
[doing a series of hand bumps with Erin] Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?
All right, all right.Okay, start over.
That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?
Hey.
Well, okay, then.
yeah.
Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved.
[slightly surprised] Sure.
I'll get my coat.
Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
Hey, you OK?
Oh.
Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]
I've got the seat adjusted right.
I was just leaving.
I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
Hey.
Yeah. [long pause] You were gone.
For a long time, Andy.
Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
What?
Andy?
Andy.
I'm trying..
Andy.
You can't fire-
If you want to talk to me
I'll be in the annex.
Alright? I'll be in the annex.
Toby!
Toby?
Hey. You got a sec to talk?
Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
Yeah.
I do think we can have a fair....
Alice. Oh man.
Yeah. We uh, have a history.
Well. Is it?
Ok.
Andy, that is really inappropriate.
It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
Yeah.
No.
It is so unpleasant. You?
Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
It was college. That is what you do.
She's nice to me.
Oh my god.
Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
No!
I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background]
Why don't you say in the beginning: ���This isn't really going that well���
Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.
Yeah.
Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
Poor Angela.
Erin! Erin! Just stop.
Relax.
Yeah. [Erin kicks box] Whoa!
Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.
Yeah, a little bit.
Oh, no, no, no. No it���s cool.
It���s cool, man. I���m sure you and I will have our own thing.
See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]
Plop? Still?
Fine.
A horse.
What���s the opposite of a horse?
Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So��� thanks PBS.
Yeah, come on, Tobes.
There he is!
