Hey, baby.
No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
Come on.
Yeah, you too. Should be fun.
Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.
That's what I'm talking about.
OK.
All right, let's go.
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
What the hell man?
No, you take it easy.
No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
Hey baby.
[to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
Yeah? Let's get you into a tub.
What? Iverson's not fat.
Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?
Why don't you get on that?
What are you gay?
That's disgusting.
[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.
Engaged, yeah.
What's up?
Are you still mad at me?
Come on [begins to tickle Pam]
Come on, you mad at me?
Are you still mad at me now?
Are you mad at me now?
Huh? huh?  Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.
I was just kidding.  You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
[on video] Yes.
[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
Yeah, let's get out of here.
...talking about? He's a jackass every year.
[Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
Pam. Go.
Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.
Boys R Us!
Hey, hey, hey.
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
You look like you feel bad.
Little package!
You look good.
Natural redhead.
That's her?
No!
At the party?
How are ya?
You look great!
Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
All right, I'll see ya.
Hey! Guys, what's going on?
What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you.
You're all gay.
[looks around conference room] You're joking right?
Hey babe.  Hey, how are you!?
You look good.
Hey, um, I was wondering if it'd be ok if I go to Lonny's poker game tonight.  I promise, it'll be like the last time for a while.
Oh, man.  Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or...
Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best!
Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning.
Alright, bye. [Pam looks around the office]
This is awesome.
Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.
I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
Oh, no. That is not worth it.
Never.
Yeah.
No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
Where did you go to school?
Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
Come on!
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
No, it was Captain Jack.
Yeah!
Yes, I have. [kisses Pam]
Should have done it a long time ago.
I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.
Come on.
We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.
Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.
No.
[laughing] I think he's dancing.
Nope.
You mean the thing?
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
You ready?
Why?
I don't understand.
Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
So, we're cool, right?
All right.
Sweet.
Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?'
Like next to no benefits.
Exactly.
That's what I'm talking about.
Absolutely.
In my truck.
Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.
Really?
How's that union stuff coming?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey babe.
You almost ready to go?
What's wrong?
What, you're mad at me?
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
You think you can beat up Darryl?
I think you might be able to.
So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
Yeah! That's great.
She took you down, huh?
Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.
Sweet. All right.
Sorry, babe. I am just beat.
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
See you.
Chicken or fish?
So you havin' a good day?
Good, glad.  OK.
After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.
[walking into the break room] Hey.
You look nice.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
[as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.
How are you likin' the new car?
Yeah?  Sure is small.  Got airbags?
[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
Hey there.
So how's your day going?
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.
[laughs] Cool, all right.
Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you...
Sure.
Yeah?
No problem.
I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?
What does that mean?
I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
Crazy day, huh?
Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.
So I only use three?
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]
Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]
You don't know?
He's in the office.
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.
What's the problem?
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.
I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art.
Hey.
I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
Sorry about that.
You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
Hey, they're playing our song.
I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?
I can't for your art show tonight.
I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Love ya.
Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
To my place?
Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
Ok.
Hey.
You said it was important, so... How's it going?
You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
Yeah? Get you a drink.
One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
On this side.
[points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].
I can read you like a book.
You can't keep anything from me.
What?
That's awesome. That's what I want.
I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
What?
Jim came on to you?
No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
Don't yell?!
Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
Are they going to call the cops?
Jet ski money?
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
[Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.
No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
Hey Halpert!
[screams in pain] Ahh God!
[to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.
But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.
Halpert?
I'm not gonna hit you or anything.
You good?
I'm good.
Hey Darryl, what's happenin'?
Hey, what's up, guys? How you been?
What's going on with Pam?
Yeah?
Really?
Huh.
[laughs] Congrats, man.
So Pam's happy?
Wow.
I thought you were a friend.
[at Roy���s wedding] Darryl! Ha-ha! What���s happening?
Ah, thank you!
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
Are you kidding?
Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding.
Thanks...aw.
Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off?
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
Oh, cool.
So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]
You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
