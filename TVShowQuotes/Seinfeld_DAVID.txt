Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.
David Richardson.
But Mr. Dalrimple--
Well, that's easy for you to say.
You're Jerry right?
How do you feel?
Something the matter?
Then what is it?
Oh, hi, Jerry.
What move?
You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.
Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.
Whatever. I don't even do it.
Yeah, that's right.
Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.
All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town.
Good!
No, I'm sorry.
I can't do the move.
Oh, he's ruined it for me.
No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.
I'll come up with some new stuff.
Sure.
What?
I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
Bad gasket?
What is all this?
What kind of car is it?
All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.
Uh-huh.
Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right?
Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.
Yeah.
Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely
Just had our third anniversary on April 8th

(Mad) You know as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is George's fault
Wow that's so touching
(Looking in through the window) Hey it's George
No, let's go in.
