Katy.
Wow, thanks.
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
What?
Regular coffee is fine.
No really it is.
Bring it on.
So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
Thank you.
Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...
That was on Sesame Street.
No, I don't believe that.
Hi
Yeah.
Cool. What year were you there?
I should probably get back to my table.
Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
This one's really good for a hot date.
[laughs]
Congratulations.  You need a hot date more than anyone.
Good.
[whispers] Sorry.
[to Pam] Come back...
Is that from Starbucks?
Wow. Is that for the office?
I wouldn't think of it.
Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me.
Oh no, it's um...
No...
No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
At five?
Okay.
Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
Okay. Cool.
Cool.
I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.
Oh, thank you.
You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.
I don't think so I'm really busy.
I can't.
I really can't.
No.
Both.
What colors do you like?
Hi.
I'm Katy.
You sit out there, don't you?
Okay, um...
Okay. [laughs]
Okay.
Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
Thanks.
You got that?
Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
Why?
It's a... it's a very nice car.
It's very popular, yeah.
I'm not sure. It's faux snakeskin.
No.
You're really into reptiles, huh?
Oh, um, it's okay.
Thank you.
Ha. Yeah, asks a lot of questions.
We could do that ten years ago.
Hi.
Yeah.
Cool, what year where you there?
Oh.
I'm gonna go back to my table.
No.
Hi!
How are you?
I'm good. It's good to see you.
I'm hungry.
Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.
Um, for the... the desert island.
Okay, um, first, Legally Blond.
Okay.
Alright! You want to drive?
Alright.
[looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute.
You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?
Pam, were you a cheerleader?
That's hilarious.
Bishop O'Hara.
Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
Do you think that'll ever be us?
What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
Whoa. What?
You should make a toast.
Jim, come on, don't be shy.
Everybody, everybody? There is a toast. Come on...
Yeah, toast! Toast! Toast!
Cheers.
