Hey Jerry.
Hi. (to Elaine)
Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42.
Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away)
Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you?
I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?
Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?
You gonna be home later?
Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away)
[It's K.B., I have the suit]
Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.)
You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?
That's right, and it's an Armani.
I don't even want anything for it.
Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime.
Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder)
All right. Ill leave you alone. (turns and walks out the door)
Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.
You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?
How about Mendys, ooh, ever been there?
Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 700.
Ahh.
I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets.
You work out with weights?
You should.
You worn the suit yet?
Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.
Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, Ill save the meal for another time.
I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.
Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.
But I don't want anything but soup.
But I had the hot dog.
Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?
Hey.
You worn the suit yet?
You did?
OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George)
What kind of soup do you have?
Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.
What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.
This is lunch in a coffee shop
Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)
Im really not comfortable ...
Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back.
Well it's my suit.
Hey Jerry, where's my suit?
(leans backwards from the counter) Yeah!
Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You!
(from outside Monk's) Take It Off!
Hey Kramer.
Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit)
Did you get that here?
You're telling me.
It's hard for me to find pants that --
Yes
What size are you?
42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?
100 Bucks
175
300 dollars.
You throw the shirt in?
Hey that's the women's dressing room.
Elaine, where's Kramer?
Kramer.
Jerry.
Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.
Pretty good.
Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.
Can we go back to Mendys?
Twice? I wanna go twice.
Two Mendys.
Here you go.
(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.
You promised me.
Mmm. This soup is great.
I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?
Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --
Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink.
Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air)
Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
Why not?
Okay. Okay.
I think he's in a good mood.
Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.
Hey Jerry.
Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
You think you can give me a hand with my material?
(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
Hey Jerry!
I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.
Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.
Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh?
Oh. This is awkward.
Ouch.
Hey Jerry, didja see it?
How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
