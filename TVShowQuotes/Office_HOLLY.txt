I love the view.
Hi.
Man, someone doesn't like H.R.
[to Toby] What did you do to him?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
What do you do here?
No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
Oh. Good for you guys.
Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi.
What do you do?
Oh, good for you.
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
Well that is a very safe place for them.
Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
That's good.
No, no, I...
Ooh, uh...
Um... Y-yeah. Okay.
Thanks.
Great.
Hey Kevin.
Do you need some help?
Well, what do you like to eat?
Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
[tool clicking] Damn it!
Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
Yoga.
[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
[overdramatically] Acting!
[laughs] Lovitz.
[enters conference room] Hello.
You too.
Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.
No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
Here you go.
Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.
Oh that is so sweet.
What's protocol on this?
Michael, are you okay?
Oh, of course you are.
No, hey.
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
That-That's my car.
Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
I just... Um, excuse me.
Cool! You drive your own car?
Yep. Just like you.
Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.
Not bad.
Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.'
Is he okay?
Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
Hey there.
So you missed something really big.
Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
Okay.
Oh that would be great.
I love pie.
Okay.
Okay. Good night.
Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.
Oh, I think that makes us neighbors.
Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.
Great.
Ex-squeeze me.
Almost, Kevin.
Math is hard.
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
Oh, thanks. I should check that out.
Actually, I'm a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
I knew that. OK, bye.
Oh, fancy meeting you here.
Wikka wikka wikka what?
You're shaking. Are you all right?
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
Oh, she's very beautiful.
So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
No! You do not talk to him like that!
He is not an idiot!
He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
Well, no. Dwight...
I'm sorry.
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
Obesity-caused illnesses.
That's so lame they didn't invite us.
Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
It'll probably be a total disaster, but...
Really?
Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.
It's kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right?
What's wrong?
Dieting's only half of it.
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting---'
What are you doing?
Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...
I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off...
Oh, no.
No.
And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters.
So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
Look at where my seats were.
Yeah.
Michael, you don't have to buy them.
Ok.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, great.  I got it.
Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It's gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it's not.  I have to read from the binder.
Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Well, I just have to get through the binder.
I am?
Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right.
No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.
Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
What was the dilemma?
Oh--- no no no.
No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
It's Mike-raculous.
Sounds good.
Oh I already bought this...
So, I've gone over corporate policy.
Oh, it's very nice.
Mmm.
In Summer.
Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
I'm from da future.
Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
We punish her?
I don't think we could enforce that.
A chastity belt.
No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
What am I saying?
I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
It's not a family.  It's a workplace.
It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.
Can I sit?
Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
No, I understand.
No.  I can do it.
Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
Ahoy.
Good.
Of course. Yeah.
You OK?  You seem kind of...
I can imagine.
Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she's just on a coffee break.
She's with Angela.
You still gonna be mean to me?
Yes.
Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.
I know.
Really?
Hello.
Yeah, it was nice.
Oh, that would be great. You need that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It would help.
[to camera] No, he didn't.
Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs]
I don't care, free tonight.
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
I'm going out with you.
[shakes head] No more.
No more.
Thank you, you too.
Oh, the mall could be fun.
We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
...Hell yeah.
Yeah, that's good.
[playing cards] It's time to go.
You're crazy, go crazy.
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
Yeah, lets go grab them.
Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]
I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
Oh, good.
Can I talk to you for a second?
That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
Michael I think this is our fault.
Oh...
How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
He knows how to get things. He got me.
[giggles] Sorry.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Breaker one-nine, copy?
Kidding.
It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
You were sleeping?  You were talking before.
We're only halfway?
Let's check there.
No.
No.
No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]
It's not gonna work.
There's too much distance.
Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
And I like you too.
I've dated four guys last year too.
Oh.
Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
Oh.
Well-
How long could we keep that up?
Years?
Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
[kisses his temple] Thank you.
I do, I think so.
You'll be okay
You will.
Okay. Bye.
Well, I'll be around.
It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]
Okay.
Yeah, okay. [extends hand to Kevin]
[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
No, we're gonna do the long-distance thing.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.
[talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper.
[chuckling] No, that's not what you're grabbing.
Put....okay....
Sorry, Darryl.
All right.
Were there even cows where you grew up?
[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
Darryl....
No, you.
You are.
You are more.
You're better.
You're better than betterest.
[plants kisses all over Michael's face]
Hold your breath!
Look, Darryl, lip up.
Down, and give me 50!
[hugging Michael] Oh, snuggles!
Snuggles.
Spooning.
Mmm hmm.
Ooh!
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
Mmm.
Yeah.
No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke!
Darryl didn't want any?
I know, but from seven hours away.
Michael....
I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.
Oh, it's just later.
[unlocking front door] This is me here.
Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
All right.
Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
Lemonade sounds great.
Um, not much.
I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]
Okay, yeah.
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
Crystal cool.
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Dun-der. Dun-der...
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Oh.
Hmm...
Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
I'm Robert Dunder.
Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
That is correct!
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
That is correct!
[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
They didn't know?
Hindsight.
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
There weren't any laughs.
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Well, I'm glad we did it.
I can't wait.
What'd you think?
[laughs] Okay. So good to see you.
[on phone] This is Holly.
No this is Holly.
No, this is Michael Scott.
I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
A lot of people.
Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
Yeah.
I don't think we'd have kids.
It was just for a few weeks!
[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
You romanticize things.
Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
You made ourselves to be more than we were.
I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
Michael... [Michael hangs up]
[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
Hi.
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.
Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
[as Curly] I most certainly am.
Unnnnnnngh!
[as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh]
[in monster voice] Oh, huggy monster!
Hi.
Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
Would you put those out?
Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
It's a pea shoot...
Yeah, kind of.
Oh...
AJ gave me that.
Mmhmm.
Why?
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'
Get a life!
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Next day I found him in my bed.
We live together.
He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'
Yeah. I love him.
Oh, God, no.
Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
Yeah.
You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
You think this is funny?
Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
Michael, I'm sorry.
You guys, it wasn't my fault.
What? AJ!
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
Wow! Nice.
Oh... when did you get here?
Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
It was blue cheese dressing.
They're warm.
Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
[sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha!
Yeah.
I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
[imitating E.T.] Holly misses old phone.
[imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
[imitating E.T.] Bummer.
[imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces?
[reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
Oh, wow... you went together?
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
Yes, Michael?
What's up?
Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
What do you do in your free time?
Mmm. Do you like movies?
We have to try this out on somebody.
[with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
No more brain damage.
Ahh!
I don't know.
[with accent] Wonderful seminar!
Michael, I should get back to work.
For what?
Don't you have a sales call to go on?
We don't know that.
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
Well you don't have to agree.
No you don't.
No, you can have your own opinion.
It's the gas station on Benet Street?
Ok.
Oh no no no. I'll be fine.
Which way did he go?
Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Oh.
Hey.
Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I'll take my free stress ball too now.
What?
Are their egg rolls really that big?
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
I have no idea.
I don't know.
Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.
Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
What are you doing up here?
Dunder Mifflin.
I missed you too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.
Bye.
Okay, one more quick one.
Ohh. Can you get lower?
A little lower.
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.
So we kiss occasionally.
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.
Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
Okay.
Two people in love?
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, 'oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.' Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]
I love you.
Hello.
No, don't touch.
No touching.
Oh.
Almost got you.
You're not touching me.
And here.
Okay.
You said you would.
No, I don't think so.
Yes. Number three.
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?
Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
We weren't in love last time.
I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
Hi.
What? What are you talking about?
No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
What if I said it wasn't up to them?
The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
You do?
[imitates a squeaky bed] [laughter]
You never told me you made a movie.
It's got you.
[laughs] I can't wait.
Uh... which part?
Hey! Good movie.
I loved it.
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
Uhm...
Not worried about that.
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
I'm real.
I love you too.
Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
You must be Todd.
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
All right.
I already have.
[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
Yeah.
Oh, that's our Zen garden.
Hey, what's up guys?
Uhm.
Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
Well, some girls go through a phase.
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
No! No.
Did Todd tell you to do that?
I love you.
That's certainly opinionated.
Oh I'm going.
I don't think he's funnier than me.
No, he's not funny at all.
No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.

You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
Well we could put it in storage... in case.
You know... in case if something changes.
Nope.
Michael called Dad?
Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
Hi Dad.
Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?
I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
No. No... no Dad.
Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Well who do you have?
No. Mom?
This is your moms old stuff?
How's she doing?
How do you know when its time?

Look I need to talk to you.
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
