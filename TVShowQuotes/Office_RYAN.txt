Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Yup.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
What's up? Nice to meet you.
You should've put him in custardy.
Yeah.
All right.
Uh, Shemp.
Just Curly. Joe DeRita was different.
Chappelle's Show.
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
Great. She's cute, huh?
Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.
I have something.
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
What do you want me to do?
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
Michael? Are you done yet?
Yeah.
Thanks.
No, don't. Don't do that.
What?
Fine, don't worry about that.
Darryl Rogers?
Yeah, yeah.
But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?
OK.
I stretched before I came.
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
Yeah.
I would love to.
You don't want to recycle them?
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
What about this bottle of power drink?
Blue.
It says flavor: Blue Blast.
No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept.
Well, it's empty.
Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
[Under his breath] Still.
I mean whatever one you want.
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
What kind do you like?
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Okay. Do you like The Strokes?
Do you like The Hives?
You like the Fleebulls, The Glorps?
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Absolutely.
You staying?
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
You a big William Hung fan?
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
I did.
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
Ah, well, I'm interested in business.
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
Fozzie bear?
Got it.
Yeah.
Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.
Uh, okay, two?
Okay... uh, sorry?
No.
...I don't.
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
Yeah.
[to Dwight] Don't...
That's actually a test prep book.
That's a test prep for business school.
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
Yeah.
No, not yet.
Just started.
I... wouldn't even know where to start.
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
I am.
I am.
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
Maybe we should get some air.
I'm really uncomfortable.
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
What's your number?
Um...
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
Now I have it.
I am so sorry.
I can't believe I started the fire.
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
What?
No.
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
Good. What's up?
I'm good, thanks.
Uh, fine. What's up?
Cool.
I don't have a tape player. So...
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
$650 bucks
A credit.
It's an investment.
I think it's worth it.
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
Updating emergency contacts.
Catch-22.
What's her address? [Ryan's cell phone rings]
Hello?
Do you mean Neverland?
What?
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
Hello?
Is your wife still your contact?
Kay.
Fudge?
Ok, to what?
I have the emergency contacts.
Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
Good.
Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?
Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
I forget it, brutha.
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
Is that it?
Don't you mean constructive criticism?
Yeah. It's another note.
Look on the windshield.'
I'll check them all.
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
Hey.
Cool.
I bet you did.
What nerves?
Actually, I had mine already.
Why would I lie about a performance review?
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
Hey, is Katy coming?
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
And he's really into penguins or something?
That's really funny.
He called me Fire Guy.
Never gets old.
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
[unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod.
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Yeah, you left the price tag on.
Yeah.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
Yeah, I figured.
Hey.
Ryan Howard.
What line of work you in, Bob?
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Oh, no.
I really did not do anything.
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
Oh, how did I not guess that?
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
Yeah, Christmas.
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
I'm already in business school.
At home, not on a boat?
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Well...
[throwing up]
Here you go.
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
Yes.
They had no yams.
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
Twice.
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
You are very welcome.
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
You sure?
Ok.
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
They were out.
At three different places.
What's that?
Huh?
Yeah, I think I can handle it.
I think.
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
Creed did you organize the menu book?
No, that was mandatory.
People Magazine, crossword puzzle, keep or toss?
It's from '99.
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
Everything seems pretty much under control.
How would...
Not really.
No.
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
[again catching Jim looking at him] What?
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
That's what I told him.  Thanks. [leaves]
What's up?
What?
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
Yeah, totally.
Did she say something?
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
Can you find out?
How about rainbows?
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
Soda.
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Cool. Cool. OK.
Yeah.
You're inviting Jim?
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
I know what I said.
You really think you're going to go?
Nice. Send me a postcard.
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
I got the stamps.
The ones that say '39 cents.'
I didn't think it did.
Kelly's helping?
Yeah, sure.
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Wow.
No.
Uhm...
Yes, I--
Okay.
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
Right. Okay.
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
No! I will... go.
I like extra cheese.
Thank you.
Who uses calling cards anymore?
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
I won't.
Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.
Hey. I got the information.
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
I go to a lot of parties.
I am not giving you my keys.
What's the hard way?
Yeah, let's do it that way.
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring?
Yeah.  Maybe.
Thank you.
Um, I don't...
Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes.
My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
I know.
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
Uh, fun jeans.
I don't want ketchup.
[reading checklist] Fun jeans.
Fourth quarter projections for Jan?
Will do.
Yeah.
[shakes his head]
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
Uh, no thanks, I'm good.
Um...  Yeah, absolutely.
Thank you.
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
A dime and a nickel.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
Yeah.
Yes. I'm very excited.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
I know where we're not.
I don't think you know what you're saying.
Uh huh.
Gotcha.
Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course.
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
Yeah.
Who was that?
Is that your Cousin Mose?
Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
Depression?
Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
Wait, can you go back?
Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
They really didn't like me.
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
You drive.
I think about that all the time.
Yeah. Yeah.
I don't have a key.
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
Huh.
What was that first thing you did?
Oh.
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?
What?
They said something about Zach Braff.
No, you don't...
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
Yes.
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
Um, yeah. [shakes her hand] Ryan.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Ah.
Yeah.
Wow, um... Sorry you had to...
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
Is Jim coming back.
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
Oh, yeah, totally.
Uh yeah, we'll meet you there.
Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
I'm good! How are you? So...
Yeah.
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
Cool, thank you.
Yuh.
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Sometimes he brings more costumes.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
Thanks.
They have business classes there?
Prison sounds great.
Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises]
Ah man, I can't.
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
Thanks.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
Looks like they forgot the power cord.
No.
Huh? [puts on jacket]
[knocks on office wall] Hey.
Merry Christmas. [hands over a gift]
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
Kelly, I'm so cold!
Are you having fun in this relationship?
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
Kelly.
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
All of a sudden?
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
Is there a prize?
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
Yeah, if you don't mind.
Hi.
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
Oh...
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
What?
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
Yeah, me too.
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
Oh gross.
Kelly don't do this.
You know what you're doing.
Ok.
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
What?
Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
...It doesn't apply.
Quit it!
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Michael.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
...It wasn't personal.
Pack my--?
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.
Michael it's not... It's not...
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
Yeah, close one.
Hey, are you going to Poor Richard's?
Maybe.
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
Hey.
I've missed you too...
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
I can't imagine what I would have done.
Well that was funny, that's why.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
You know what?  I didn't---
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, I said your idea was stupid.
Don't you see why that's insane?
What about a long sleeve T?
Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
At least we're outside.
Totally, we should both work out.
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
F and C, doubletime?
I'll go.
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
[whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
What's the occasion?
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
I don't do that stuff anymore.
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Yes Michael?
Back? Why is that Michael?
Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
Did this happen on company property?
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
[sigh]
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
OK. Should we get started?
Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
Stop that! Stop that!
[to Kevin] You scared me.
Michael and everybody, umm...
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
So...
OK...
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Perfect.
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
This is company-wide, Dwight.
Andy.
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
Thank you everybody.
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
OK, what's up?
Well it is business, but not as usual.
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
So, how are you?
Good.
Kelly...
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
OK. OK.
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
Jan.
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Well... you look great.
Scranton suits you.
You were let go.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
[notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man.
Michael.
We're not doing this today.
OK. This is...
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
We have actual work to do.
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
Kelly, come on.
You don't?
You lied about being pregnant.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
We're never getting back together.
What's, uh, going on here?
With gift baskets.
Good luck Michael.
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
Literally.
... Later guys.
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
Thank you very much.
Cool.
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
Wear something nice.
What?
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
You're kidding?
That's... great, I... that's awesome.
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
Cool.
That is not correct.
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
Can you get me a cold water?
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
Thank you.
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
I'm your boss.
You have another job?
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
It did, all ready.
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
What?
No, it's whomever.
Do you really know which one is correct?
As an object.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
Hello?
What?
I told you not to call about small problems.
That's good. They're creative, you're not.
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
I'm on Michael.
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
Take the call, friend.
I insist you take your work calls.
Hey Michael.
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
Good. That is great to hear.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
Love it. Go.
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
You did. Yeah.
Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
Ok thanks Michael.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Dwight.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
TBD. Phyllis?
Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
Do you have a question Kelly?
You too.
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Na.
Sorry man.
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Unreal.
Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
Michael.
What are you doing here?
That is so awesome man!
And you brought this guy!
Aww!
I know it's you guys.
I'm so psyched you're here!
Woooo!
Let's get a drink.
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Bottle service ya'll?
Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.
Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?
This guy owns his own beet farm.
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Yeah.
I don't know, maybe.
With vodka, you're the best.
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
[to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard.
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Let's bail. [starts to leave]
You're doing it man.
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
It's inevitable, right?
Why wouldn't they let me dance?
I don't wanna go back in.
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
No. [Dwight starts singing in German]
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
Dehydration.
Yeah, New York is great.
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Yeah.
Not really.  New York is...so great.
Yes.
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
Yeah.
No.
You're my friend, Michael.  OK?
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
Yo!
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
The only good bagels anywhere.
Same with coffee, and women.
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
Congratulations!
Don't interrupt.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
And you got a goatee!
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
It's great to see you Kev.
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
All right.
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
Kelly.
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
Yeah.
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
I did.
[at a loss for words]
[stands up] Everything.  She's perfect.
Oh...
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Two HR reps.
Fraud, Jim, Fraud.
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
Yeah, isn't that messed up?
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses?
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
Gordon Gekko.
... Yeah.
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
All right.
Living in the moment.
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
What?
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
Yeah... Mmmmm...
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
That's all he wrote?
Can I see it?
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
We're back.
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
[whispers] Yeah.
You're taking two?
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
Are you happy you did?
[kisses for a little longer]  What's up?
Yeah, yeah I'll see them.
Yeah, punch him.
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
I--- I would find a way.
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
[stops kissing Kelly] I can't do this.
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Hey, you.
Sixty thousand dollars a year.
What do you make, secretary?
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
What size shoes are you guys?
What are those, a men's ten?
Where is it?
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
It was indescribable.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
Pam's better at that stuff
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
Yeah I make originals too.
Yeah!
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
This is from the sun.
No don't take that, give that back!
I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
Yeah!
Go make a copy, secretary.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Rock the house!
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
Are we staying til five?
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Keep going. [Whispers]
Write it down.
Oh!
We did it !
I can get there.
Oh, awesome.
Yeah.
Finally.
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
We can spend a couple days there.
Uncle Dave?
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
Get off my ass, you hag.
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Yeah.
Explain what you think that is.
I never went to Thailand.
I went to Fort Lauderdale.
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
You've never had Pad Thai.
Oh, that's nice.
He's bluffing, Pam.
Maybe.
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
That we're having any problem at all.
No, man.  You're-- you're fine.
Just put it out of your mind.
Michael, you  haven't even heard--
We'll have to talk about this.
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
Yeah, discuss these things--
Yes, yes, yes!
[whispering] Who is it?
Oh, thanks, man.
You look so classy in that picture.
Tough.
You.  Us.
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Chiklis style.
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
That looks great.
I can eat.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
Exactly.
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Things have been generally good.
Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
At these prices with this service...
You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
No, no, no.  Sir, don't listen.
Stop flustering me, everybody!
Okay.
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
Thanks.
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Don't vaccinate it.
Hey.
Yeah, I might stop by.
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
Yes, I'm coming to your wedding.
Probably, yes.
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
Instead of $5,000 a year from now?
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
Um... also--
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Then do it.
Write a book.
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about...
Ahh, I don't think so, no...
I'd rather not say.
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
Twenty.
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
I'd rather not say.
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
Hey.
Quick question.
Are you scared?
We heard about the punch.
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
alright.  See you there.
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
I'll use it when you're done.
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
The company's probably going under, though.
Seems like it's leaning one way.
Definitely.
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
What?
Great.
Yep, that is a problem.
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
Mmm-hmm.
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything.
[from behind the door] Is there internet?
How's it going?  Good day?
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
Ugh.
Whoa, whoa.
I'm doing something over here.
What are you talking about?
No no no.
Yeah! That was the idea.
Awesome!
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
Did you see Saw?
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
Yes!
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
Don't just criticize my idea!
You think of something then!
Nick.
Like Frodo!
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
Why are you being so weird about this?
Why no kids?
It's my -
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
No, Stanley, do you -
Guys, one second. [on dance videogame]
One second.
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
Good work, buddy.
C.C. me
That's a little derivative.
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
Okay...
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
Sorry, dude.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Okay.
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
Good for you, man. Good for you.
He takes what he wants.
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
You read my mind.
Yep.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Thank you, Erin. Woof!
[jumps in front of camera] Wuphf.com!
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
-and you jump in front of them.
America is one big mall.
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
Yeah, I liked them too.
But if he doesn't?
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
No.
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
Hello.
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
We're behind.
How's It Going?
Hey, I'm WUPHF.
What's up Facebook?
You should've sent me a WUPHF.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
I love it.
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
Awesome.
How's everybody doing?!
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
For my current investors, things are going great.
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Fun, communication, connection.
Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
[colorful poster with numbers] Check this out.
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
Yo, Ry from WUPHF!'
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
Baby, Baby, Baby--
No, no, no, no, no.
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
The Washington University Public Health Fund.
The domain name. Yeah, they do.
Have some faith in this idea!
Yes. You alone do, actually.
Michael, how's it going, bro?
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
We totally should.
I gotta work on this.
Yeah. [Michael closes the door]
I'm betting on myself.
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
Actually, it was.
Where is Tibet?
When was China founded?
Who is Mao?
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
He's rubbing his neck.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
Okay.
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
The other way.
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
Yeah.
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
Okay, no.
No, she's lying.
In you go.
Yup.
And?
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
Yes.
Yes, I'll do it.
And if I flake, I flake.
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
It's not irrelevant. Details
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
Hey. You're looking for me?
No you weren't.
You wanted to have sex in my office.
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
You should enter it in festivals!
Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
[seems unsure] Everything... Everything.
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
[muttering] Sometimes you over react.
Free sample?
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
Thank you. Whatcha got there?
My mom also makes the best salsa.
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Nice.
Can't really tell the...
Will you marry me Holly?
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
Yeah that's great.
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
You helped me get off drugs!
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
This is... totally unnecessary.
No.
Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
I'd die for you too.
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
All the time.
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
I did not see Rango.
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
I felt terrorized.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
You guys, um, talking Senator?
Cause he's totally gay? [walks away]
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
I want an outsider.
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
Take care, man.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
Profound man, your husband.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
I���m sorry,��� L���?
Uh, is that a vibrator?
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
T-Dog?
SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
Why not? What are you doing?
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
What's the dress code on this?
This is not funny, man, let me down.
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
Whoopi Goldberg.
Oh my god!
We can't do this Dwight.
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
Yeah me too.
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
What's the halal option?
Out.
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
May I go first?
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
Actually Ryan.
Bitttch!
Yes!
Will do.
Whoo!
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
I'm trying but you need to-
I'd be satisfied with eight.
Nine?
Oh, neat.
Oh, great.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Yeah?
Okay, I'm turning it off.
I won't look at it.
I can't- I can't not touch it.
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
Oh, so close. Eighty-one.
Robert, you are too kind.
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
To both these bears.
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
To madness.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
I get that.
Eh, a little bit.
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
What are the criteria for going?
Stop calling us ���guys���.
Stop. Stop it Andy.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
But...
No no, I want to go.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
Right. Think different, from Apple.
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
So who's leading this thing, anyway?
I can't wait to meet him.
I-
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
Dwight?
Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.
I can field this one.
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
A waffle?
No.
Oh, no, I didn't know.
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Hello, what do we have here?
Right.
Got that. [Metallic thud] Get down.
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, this is fun.
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Yeah?
Really?
Yeah.
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
Are you holding this chair?
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
Sabre. It���s time to come home.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
You know what?
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
And you know that I���m capable of this.
What did you think of the presentation?
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
Thought you checker my Tumblr?
Well, I updated it.
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
Yeah!
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Me too.
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
For Kelly?
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
This poem would crush you!
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
You are toxic! You are toxic!
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Will you roll those dice with me?
No you don't.
No you don't.
What? [they hug]
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
Smokey's dead.
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Huh?
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
Um... God, so many, Nellie!
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
That's... That's not the point!
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
Okay well, that's a relief!
Yeah... Who's opening?
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
Kelly, you���re here.
Hey.
No, this little guy is mine.
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
Say ���hi���, Drake.
Yeah.
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
I love you.
We���re gonna be together forever.
I finally mastered commitment.
