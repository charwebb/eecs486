Kramer!
I'm on the roof!
I can't. I'm goin' to a movie.
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
It gets my rug clean.
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
Hello Jerry.
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
No reason.
Ill bring him up to date.
Oh, all the way up.
Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
Wow, where did you get that?
Boy, thats the full size.
Can I have a bite?
Just one bite?
All right! All right. I wont say anything.
I swear.
On my mothers life.
Oooh,
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
It was disgusting.
(enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ?
I despise him.
Why? I'll tell you why...
No, you can't tell it ..
All right, tell it.
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
Well that's the way it happened.
I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
And then you spit on us.
Oh, yeah, right.
Wow, it was McDowell.
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
It was McDowell.
Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
Me too.
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
Never.
Who's talking to you?
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
Hey George, nice hat.
Can I try it on?
Well sure it would.
Come on, let me try it on.
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
Me either.
But it's your house.
Hello, boys.
You lookin' for someone?
Coy? I'm not being coy.
Who?
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
George?
Help! Help!
HELP! (Elaine enters.)
They're gonna beat me up!
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
Yeah. From you.
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
Kramer.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
Well my girlfriend had one.
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
Nevertheless, ...
Don't say anything.
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
Well you're reneging.
All right give it to me. let go ...
Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)
Use me for what?
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
No, but there's karma, Kramer.
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
Come on, are you ready? Let's go!
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
You must be banker.
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
You know what I mean.
And why was that?
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
Okay.
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
As you were saying, Mister Kramer...
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
Yes, a phone call!
From me!
Yes, from me!! I called you remember?
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
You were going to...
Yes, the banker!!!
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
You're off your rocker.
Crazy Joe Davola?
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
Yeah.
Deh!
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
Okay. What is it?
Your nipple's showing.
Anything else?
All right. See you later.
Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
I'm a United States postal worker.
Sometimes...
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
You're gyppin' us!
They follow him like a cult.
I don't like it.
Alright, well be back... *jack*!
Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
A piece of crap.
I find you extremely ugly.
You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
I *loathe* you.
Make us!
It was a real melee.
Hey, hey...
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) So, any news?
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
It's Thursday.
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
Who made you the leader?
Alright.
I shoulda gone in with him.
What you need me in the car for?
I use dental tape.
I don't wanna.
No.
Why, because I use dental tape?
No, no I don't like it.
I like the thick tape.
Will that take care of ours too?
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
It'll be my pleasure.
See'ya later.
After you.
Pair of bear claws, please.
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
I can't eat this.
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
It's okay. A little crooked.
What's the catch?
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
It's Newman.
(dancing) Can I use your bathroom?
My toilet's clogged.
No.
He's out.
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
Yeah, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
No. No.
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
Ohh, were you there?
(looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
(couple quick breaths) Shocking.
(running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!
You might say that.
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
Who is it.
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
Not really.
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
Care for some lemonade?
Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha
Hi Babs
Minding my own business.
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
I wanted to, he won't let me.
Don't look at me.
Hello Jerry, may I come in?
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
Jerry? I'm a little insulted.
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
Tim Whatley.
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
(fleeing to the bedroom) Damn!
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
What are you doing?
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
I can't think, there's all this noise.
I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
(surprised) Kramer.
(defensive) What're you talking about...
All right, so it's me. So what?
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!
(sobbing) I can't afford that!
Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
What for, you got your own.
( resumes eating) Well that's a shame.
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Hello?
Hey, what's up?
What for?
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
The airport?
I don't have that kinda dough.
Oh no, no, not the bag!
All right, all right.
Kramer.
Okay, here it is.
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
Of course. Obviously.
What kind of dog did you say it was?
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
Anyway.
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
Yeah, I suppose.
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
Excellent. Excellent.
All right, give me the rope.
Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
I knew you'd back out.
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
Let's go. Let's go. Move!
What do you think? Drive. Drive.
Yep.
Yeah, but he's a fighter.
Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
All right. Bark.
Bark.
???????
We're practically to Monticello.
What took you so long?
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
One large jambalaya, please.
Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!
[panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
Olly, olly, oxen, free!
Mouth-to-mouth?
Huh.
You go.
Yeah, but you pulled him in.
Nah.
Yeah. Maybe.
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
Alright, let's begin.
(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
Gangway!
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
Hey!! Help me!
This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
Jerry?
Like Silkwood.
That's right.
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
You certainly are in a bind.
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
Do we have a deal?
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hello. What 's this?
Work? It's raining.
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
I was never that big on creeds.
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
Yes thank you. (slams door)
We made quite a haul.
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
(taking bottle) Refund?
I don't know, they're deranged.
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
Ten cents!?
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
You tried it?
(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
Damn!
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
(triumphant) Yessss!
Ahaha!
Come on Kramer!
It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
(triumph) Let the collecting begin!
How much gas we got?
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
Is that Jerry's number?
What're you doing?
On what?
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
What're you doing?
Are you crazy?
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
(perks up) A pie stand? Where?
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
Where? I..I..I don't see it.
I don't see any pie...
...Aargh!
Kramer!!
(after speeding truck) Kramer!!
Federal employee. Federal employee.
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
Oh, thank you, sir.
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
(screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah!
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
Go on.
Ah, yes. Forbidden love.
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.
You must!
You will!
Blast!
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
Yes...
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
Hi. How are you?
I too am well.
Do I smell Pantene?
Pantene!
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
Shell.
Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?
Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
Right.
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
It's about...Elaine.
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
I'm doing it for you.
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
Yeah, tell me about it.
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
Lucky krauts.
Oh, that's real.
Hello Jerry.
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
Frequently.
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
Can I have a sip?
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
Is this or is this not your signature?
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
There will be a small fine.
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
Nice place you got here Kramer ...
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
(eating) hm.
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
Uh-Huh.
It's getting cold, it's getting cold.
Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
Number 67, right here, right here!
Hello Jerry.
I love.. broccoli, its, good for you.
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
Vile weed!
Yes, Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.
(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.
Sometimes we don't get what we want.
I didn't get my transfer.
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
Jerry!
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
(Intrigued) What are you proposing?
An alliance?
Kramer bit me!
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail!
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
(Realizing) Damn!
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
What the hell was that?
(sings) Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
I have done nothing unethical.
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
(thoughtful) What kind?
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
Alright. Come back to my party, please.
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand)
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
Hello Elaine. Where are they?
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
Hello, Jerry.
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
Butter?
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
That smell. It's still with you, huh?
Here.
I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
(salivating) Turkey?
I'm sorry I missed that.
Here. Hold this.
Hello Jerry.
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
What about your bills?
The bank. What about your cards and letters?
All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
Kramer, what the hell are you doing?
Not that!
You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
No! And no one will ever see you again!
Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
(whimpering) Tell the world my story.
(laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso!
eue-aaa.
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
I told you he was a risk.
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
We got no one!
What about a guest-host?
Woah.
Go girl!
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
Aww..
(Suggesting Jerry) Does yours?
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
(Negotiating) Your next, fifty wishes.
Fourty-nine.
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
Hilarious.
To prevent an ambush.
Wallet.
It's Newman.
I can't believe I'm being evicted.
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
Well, there's very little sleeping going on.
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
Hey, what is that up that tree?
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
The Pacific Northwest.
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
This isn't about my opening your mail?
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
Sorry. Climbers, keepers.
You are?
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
Cool?
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
Yeah, but I though-
Can't we worry about them later?
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
Alright, who's first?
Name, please.
(Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
I think he stealing our rickshaw!
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
It's entirely possible.
(To Jerry) Good night.
There it is!
Uh..
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
(Realizing he won) Yeah.
Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
(Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
Waaaaahhhh!
Hello, Jerry.
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
Take me! Take me!
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
