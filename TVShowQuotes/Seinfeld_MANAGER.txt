Excuse me, Sir. What are you doing?
(Pointing) Did you take that book with you into the bathroom?
Did you want to speak with the manager?
Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters.
That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.
I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.
