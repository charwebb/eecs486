Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
We're loading at one.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
Just getting a tea bag.
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
You're on.
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
Block, block, block!
Take your shot man!
That was you.
Yeah, this isn't happening.
Yeah.
Iverson. Yeah, always man. It's very important.
Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.
Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
Hiding from his momma.
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Yes, this is the one.
You remember? Yes!
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've seen Santa.
Who cares?
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
I had to. I needed defense.
It's defense.
It is worth it.
Are you kidding? You wait.
That's okay, Mike.
All right. Thanks, man.
Yeah.
How about the sales department is the sails?
What?
That's what I'm talking about!
[speaking Spanish] Por favor, tequila seoor.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
That was definitely not dancing.
Paper business.
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah. Mo'fo, mo'fo.
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
The experience...
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
Mike.
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
Look, would ya... look.
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
My priority is safety.
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
That bothers me too.
I hate that too.
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
But we get paid a lot less.
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
That's what we need.
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
Man, hook you up.
Union! Union, yeah.
Are you with us Mike?
Welcome to the warehouse.
This is not a good idea right here.
Hey Michael. This ain't over.
That's my office.
Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
You must be pretty strong, huh?
You think you could beat me up?
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Except my warehouse.
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
What?
Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
[sighs] Dinkin' flicka.
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
What?
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Hey Mike.
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
I wasn't.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
All right. Se you later...
All right, what's up Mike?
Yup.
Uh huh.
Yup.
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
You ready for me?
Cool.
Okay.
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
That there's a woman's suit.
I'ma call Roy, man.
This is gonna make him feel better.
This is too good.
Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
What?  I can't hear you.
I can't--- what, Mike?  Are you---
Why can't I just... tell you?
There you go.
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Come on, be for real Mike.
[laughs] Are you serious?  You're earning this?
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
Ho-ho!
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
What?
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
Yeah, you should.
Fourteen years long.
Make it happen, cap'in.
Comfortable, Mike?
How about you, man.  Comfortable?
Thank you.
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Mm, it's not that big.
Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
Should you drive the forklift?
No! No no no no no!  I said
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Do you understand that?
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
Anybody?
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
No do not touch it!
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Take them at the same time.
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
Actually, you did.
Alright, we outta here.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Way
Come down, okay?
Summing up.
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
Presbyterian.
Oh?
Alright! [high fives Pam]
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
Look how happy he is.
What's up man?
Make a delivery.
Kelly ordered this online.
Who knows?
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
Who's it?
Here you go.
So you still missing Ryan?
Mmmmm.
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
Hey, get off.
I have plans later.
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
My daughter.
That was cold.
Hey, let's call this what it is.
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
Slow down, think it over.
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
Dunder Mifflin.
Dunder Mifflin.
What's rap?
Great.
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
Dunder Mifflin.
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
You just said you hated it.
[playing ping-pong] Game, son!
19, serving 4. [serves and scores]
Yes.
Mike.
I'm very busy here, man.
Why?
No, no, no...
No, um... I have.
Both.
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
Newsies.
Oh my goodness.
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
Well, it's effective.
Hey, are we doing this thing?
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
What college did you go to Mike?
Show them what you brought, Mike.
Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
Yeah. [music starts]
Unh! Damn it!
No.
Don't go breaking my scale.
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
You guys lost four pounds.
I say we have a parade.
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
She's six.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
What's up, Mike?
You a baby daddy?
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
You should stop calling yourself 'baby daddy.'
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
You feel connected to his baby over there?
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
No.
Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
Hey Mike, do my thing.
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Sold! To Jim.
She thought I was McNabb. [laughing]
Yeah, well, watcha gonna do?
What's up, Roy?
Oh, what's up, Roy?
Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
Mike you'll drive this every weekend?
This trip was longer than I thought.
Not really.
Four hours. Almost halfway there.
Next exit isn't for five miles.
There's nothing out here man.
WHAT!?
Clever, Mike.
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
Please call me back.
Please...
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
This is the last of it.
You're not staying?
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
Da  na na na na.
Da  na na na na.
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
Da  na na na na.
Da  na na na na!!
Da  na na na na .
Yeah!  Da  na na na na.
YEAH! Da  na na na na.
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
It's like Driving Miss Daisy, you know?
You gotta include me in the conversation.
If you don't mind.
I got a game. Cow surfing.
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
Everybody got a government cow.
Here we go. Go get him, Mike!
Then why did you say 'Jackson Five?'
All right, I made it up.
Because I wanted you to like me.
[trying not to laugh] Okay.
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
[rubs face in exasperation]
[setting stopwatch] Go.
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
You know.
There you go.
Oh, thanks. Thanks. No.
Thank you. Thank you. No.
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
[holding camera] Here we go.
Stairs. Oh, man....
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
Yo.
Thanks man.
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
You can owe me.
I know, right.  Merry Christmas.
Something wrong with the doll?
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
What's his name?
Roy left years ago. What's his name?
What's
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
Start over.
Were the boxes near each other?
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
Yes.
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
Be quiet.
Thanks T-Man, later.  [fist bumps Toby}
Toby! Dwight!  Is that them?
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
Why would you think a lady is me?
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
C'mon Gwenneth.
Cool.
Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Alright, yeah fine so whatever...
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
What the hell is wrong with you?
There's other pencil's in this office.
Michael.
I know who did that.
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
You need to get back on top.
Yeah.
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
I can't. You know that.
Hey, what's up?
Thanks, it's cool. So...
Has that ever happened? Ever?
You want me to invite Matt?
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Happy hour. My pleasure.
So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
Tell 'em your story, Hide.
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
Sounds all right.
I didn't say 'a'ight.'
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
Curl up with your favorite DVD.
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
Close the door.
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
It's bad.
It's real bad.
Still no plan.
It's getting bigger.
I can videotape it.
[to camera] There it is.
What?
You haven't even introduced yourself.
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
Mm-hmm
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
This... [removes camera headset]
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Pam.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
No.
All right, this is just messed up.
All right.
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
It says decaf. You get me decaf?
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
He's got to go, Mike.
Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
What's wrong with a level playing field?
Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.
I'm telling you how to do this man.
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
Right in here?
Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
Hey!
Silent. Look, congratulations.
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
You didn't have to boo him.
How would you like it if we booed you?
Boo! Boo!
Boo! Boo!
Andy, sing us another song.
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
Condoms.
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
Yeah.
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.
If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
Nah. I play for pleasure.
I wouldn't enjoy that.
Oh, yeah?
How much?
That's crazy money. I'll take forty.
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
But you're singing it.
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
Oh, I never sing with soul.
Song's about truth.
What's something you really care about?
More universal.
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
Go ahead.
Which me am I gonna be today?
Oh, don't worry about it.
Yeah.
One, two, three, hit it.
I'll be your croak monsieur.
I find you absolutely ribbiting!
Scoopity-splash!
Dracula.
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
Yeah. We're cool.
What's under your shirt?
[answers phone] Hello?
I'm good.
This is embarrassing, Michael.
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
I'm not mad. Are you mad?
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Mike.
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
That's it.
Yes.
No.
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
You said no to this one!
What have you done for me?
What have you done for me?
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
I don't understand the point of a hat.
Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
This was your freshman year.
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
I agree. I think it's superb.
Hey Andy.
You gotta stop texting me so much.
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
No.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
[reads text] 'Are you watching this?' Seriously?
I'm sitting right here.
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
You accept these terms?
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
[laughs] That's a text. [high fives Andy]
That's your new standard.
I'll take one of those pink pouches.
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
She did?
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
Uh, no.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
How do I do that?
Are you serious?
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
Sure, sweetie.
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
And the game's over seconds later.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
Hey, Mike.
We wanted to give you something.
What do you say?
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
I got that cutie behind the counter.
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
Hey, how'd you do?
Really?
Cool.
A book about oceans.
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
Whoa! Hold on.
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
We're going skating.
Sup?
To the arcade.
Why, did you meet someone?
Right on, son.
Right.
Ahem!
[whispering] They're a bunch of jackals.
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
What's it say?
And I will take you all down.
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
Wrap it up, Gabe.
Send me one too.
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
Dreaming he's a dog on a island.
Thinking about my grandmother a lot.
She was about to turn 97.
Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
[tears welling up in his eyes]
Rachel from the party?
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
Yeah, it's a little much.
Obviously, so happy for them both.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
Okay. I'll keep working.
I can hear you.
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
Pick it up.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Make that face he likes.
We should play it.
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
It was in the box.
Thank you.
Dallas indeed.
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
Yeah where is it?
Kind of embarassing.
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
No, I'm good. Keep them.
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
Damn that was cold.
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Hey.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
No. Can't let you do that Mike.
Seriously?
Snap, for real?
The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
Damn!
Daaamn!  Mad respect for my brotha!
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
Do it!
I'll take him.
What's wrong with you?
Yeah.
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Nine first.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I did.
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
[pats Andy on the back] Thank you.
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
I thought that was your job.
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
I... I just thought you knew me.
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
Hope it's all right.
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
Yes. How did he do?
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Paper material, ma'am.
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
[sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
I���m lifting.
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.
Good times.
Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.
It���s ok E-Dog, just who called?
No no no no.  I like her.
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
I���ll introduce you.
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
I don't know.
No.
I haven't hired anyone.
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
I got it. I'm doin' it.
When did I get so fat?
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Oh yeah.
One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
I don't
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
OK.
OK.
Yeah.
Why do you wanna work here?
That's not a good reason.
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
Did you hire 'em?
What do you mean ���they left���?
Then I think you should fire me.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
Would you just fire me, man?
You wanna make me happy? Huh?
Give me your job.
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
He died.
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
OK.
OK, don't fire me.
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
Why is the forklift in the wall?
Is that grease on my floor?
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
And?
Let me see it.
Let me see it!
What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
I've seen this, that's not you.
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
Rosebud?
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
No. You're wrong.
Cheeseburger or hamburger.
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
Put it on, man.
Three Kings.
This party���s tight.  The fog is cool.
Perfect.
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
Dwight?
Dwight.
Dwight!
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
Oh yeah.
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
I'll be there.
It's not a race.
Who knows what the belt is for?
Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
You done?
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
Mmhmm. [points at gabe] Caramel soy latte.
Got it.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
Good policy. Sensible. Smart.
What are you doing here, Gabe?
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
Dude.
Look man this is a bad idea.
Really? That is messed up man.
You���re a bad man Andy Bernard.
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
What are you doing with my lunch?
It���s not pizza.
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
Nice scatting, man.
That was never agreed upon.
Again, never agreed upon.
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
What, you don't like the blues?
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
No man, we are.
No, no, no.
Every day.
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
J-j-j-ju...
Shh! Movie's almost over.
I got Source Code on the way back.
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
Hunger for hamburger.
That's good.
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
Hey.
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
I hate myself.
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
I'll come with you.
Hey man.
Taking a load off huh?
Good luck with that.
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
Uh weight lifting yeah.
I���ll take a look.
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
Make a real gym.
Getting my sweat on.
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
No.
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
It's Lejon Brames.
You know, get it right.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
Okay, I'm not doing that.
Looks that way.
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
Dwight, come back and spot me.
To push this bar up.
Help me!
To look good for Val!
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
Alright.
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
Popsicles?
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
I thought you'd wear a sweater.
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
Hi.
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
I'm in.
It's trivia.
That's a great plan.
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
What?
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
Yes, Shawn Marion.
Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
Yeah, we're going to get clobbered.
Val. You made it.
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
Mmm. [they clink cups]
[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
Cool.
Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let's do this!
Nice.
Why?
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
It's all good, we got this.
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
Eat it.
Eat. It.
Correction: we don't care.
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
[Low singing] Old, mill, stream.
Mm hmm.
What do we have here?
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
[clears throat] Notice anything different about me?
Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
Yeah.
Hey.
No, no, no. Maybe just later.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
[on phone] This is Darryl.
Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
We're friends. We're friends.
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
Back off! I got my reasons.
Hey what's up? You called?
It's cool really.
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers.
Your mom?
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
I loved it.
Oh [bleep] yeah.
Yes sir. Thanks.
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
Processed.
What's up man? I'm Darryl.
Oh yeah.
I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
Uh, 'The moon is huge tonight.'
That's regular text talk.
You're such a great friend.'
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
She's got a boyfriend.
It has been processed.
Sure.
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
Andy, who punched you?
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
What?
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
I'll put you down for shortbreads.
No. No.
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
OK, great.
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
[to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack.
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
Thank you.
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
You're not talking... triple digits?
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
Forget it, man.
I'm out. And so is Toby.
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
I was still thinking of going back to school.
Me.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
So how was the drive in?
You don't say?
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
He does not like that wall.
Looking good, RC!
You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
You could go downstairs and ask them?
Who knew, right?
Tacos.
I can go get us some tacos.
If you loan me some money.
$30.00
Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
Hmhmm.
She's trying.
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
Is she sick? How are her poops?
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
The coconut's pretty subtle.
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
I would.
Yeah.
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
Good slam.
Good luck to you.
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
Cool.
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
Go, Dwight Jr!
Congratulations, baby!
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
Um, where did you get that story?
That was a good one.
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
127 hours. It's about this guy who-
My bad.
Goodnight.
Oh, ok.
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
Life hacking, man.
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
What?! Really?
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Yes, yes, yes.
I included some time saving ideas...
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
You���re gonna po��� mouth
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
That could work.
I���m going for a walk.
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
Hmm. Yeah right
Like what?
What kind of job?
Hell yeah!
That sounds awesome!
I love Philly!
It's not even a thought���
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
Yeah. You too, huh?
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
That was a triple.
My pleasure.
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
You're the tutorial.
You could be.
[to Jim] What are you doing?
You popped one kernel.
Correct.
[Sitting outside building] Stop.
Too late.
You went to Cornell?
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
Get under your chin first. Yeah.
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
Yeah, that���s crazy.
Who?
Sounds great.
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
I worked at a Jiffy Lube.
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
He���s been sailing for two days.
Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
[entering] What are y���all doing?
Cool. It should be taller though, right?
That���s what I���m talkin��� about.
Bang.
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I���m gonna let them think the other thing.
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
Think that through for a sec.
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
What else could you possibly be forgetting?
Things? People?
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
[At Meredtith] Boo!
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
You!
[Looking at Jim confused] That's great.
Thanks, man.
I shall come by at your convenience.
[Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo!
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
I know, I know. It's just hard.
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
Yeah, she ended things.
Thanks, man.
Oh, hey Val.
Yeah.
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
Huh?
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
But... [Val kisses Darryl]
I'm back together with Val. Yay...
Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim���s company.
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
Yeah, I guess���
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
Yeah.
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
Cool. Hey, thanks���
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
Who needs it?
What? [Jim shrugs] How about yesterday?
Oh, thank you.
Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
Yep.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
Loyalty.
Darryl is dating Val... still.
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
It can.
I don���t do that anymore.
[sighs]
All right, let���s get this over with.
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
Fun.
They have fast food in Philly.
Exactly like this.
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
You missed a spot.
[clears throat]
No. I was clearing my throat.
[watching you tube video, laughing]
And replay.
[sighs] I���m gonna miss the paper business.
They smell so bad.
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
How much did you pay for that?
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
Hey.
Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
You too... Darryl.
It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.
That's my go-to thermos. That's all.
No big deal. No big deal.
Nah, nah...
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
Thank you.
Oh, hey.
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
All right.
I didn't say anything.
Excuse me?
What you need flour for, Jim?
What? You making bread?
What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
We good.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
I know he loves his pick up truck.
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
Damn!
That felt really good, actually.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
Hey, Andy.
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
It's ok.
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
Hey, man. Darryl.
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
Subway sandwiches.
The space dust does it.
Yeah.
Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it.
Yeah, Jim.
It's so strong.
We can look into it.
We'll go after Darth then.
That's what we gotta do.
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
Something full of acid.
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
Yep.
I was in The Whiz in high school.
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
So?
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
I believe I want to go home.
Action!
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
You talk to Wade and Colin?
We got an offer on the table.
A buyout.
We���re in play, baby.
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Yeah, we did it.
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
Can���t do what?
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
What up?
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Thanks, man.
Yep. Take care.
Hey.
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
Jim really doesn���t want to come?
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
Oh, hey. Hey, what���s up, y���all?
Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
I don���t think I sh-
Guess I���m going upstairs.
I didn���t realize we were this close.
Uh��� yeah. Depending on traffic.
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Well, it���s been great.
Maybe forever. Anyhow���
Oh, oh, I���m sure we did.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
You chose one thing?
You want to dance?
This is what you want?
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
Hello, hello.
Hey, what���s up?
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
Hey, Pam! How are you?
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
That happens a lot?
Let���s get a drink in you, huh?
Right there.
Thank you go much.
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
What? All right!
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
You did good. Real good.
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
