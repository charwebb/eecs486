I think everything is under control.
You should sit down.
No I should go fill out my paperwork.
Are you okay?
Yeah, take your time.
[to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander?
It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-
Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar.
My cousins were actually at those Olympics.
It's almost too warm.
[to Jim] Hey, late guy.
Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?
Cool, for your kids?
How was the drive?
Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.
Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter.
Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
Thank you-
Can I see?
So, I get to kick you now.
Well, that's how I played it in college.
Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
Okay, yeah.
Cool��� [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
LeBron James.
[giggles]
I haven't seen anything.
Jeez���
Is this really nessecary?
Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
[in a bathrobe] Is crazy gone?
Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster��� Okay, cool. Thanks��� I know, I'm a pig, right?
[giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.
Oh my God, what are you thinking?
I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?
Can you��� without running to the other side of the room all night?
Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold.
What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?
Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
[coughs and moans]
Oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
I can't breathe!
Stop it! [runs out the door]
Seriously disgusting.
Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.
So you���re a blogger right?
God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I���m trying to be a good girl for once.
I don't know. He's not picking up.
