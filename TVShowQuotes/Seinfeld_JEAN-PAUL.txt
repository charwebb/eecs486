Nice to meet you.
Me too. (disappointed)
Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.
Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.
Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.
Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)
Oh, please, man, please!
Flight to Cleveland?
Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!
You miss-set the timer...
Ok.
What are you saying?
Wake-up call...
No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.
Really?!
Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
Hello.
I'm a friend of Elaine's.
(looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)
(smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.
What...but I got a race tomorrow!
Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)
Man, whatever! (annoyed)
Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.
What is it...?
No, no.
Man, he doesn't got "in" for you.
It is his job!
For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)
Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!
I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.
847!? (jumps out of the sofa)
Idiot! I trusted you!
I'm late, man, I'm in the race!
Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!
