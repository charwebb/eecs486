Are you really this lazy?
Hey.
Yeaha���yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.
Yeah, sure.
That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab.
That's what I'm sayin'.
Thanks for the coffee.
Are you asking me on a date?
Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy.
Don't quit. [Darryl eavesdropping, nods]
Not bad fellas, you're better than you look.
I caught it.
I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
I think the music left without you.
Thank you.
Alright.
Isn't that just for popsicles?
Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?
What should I wear?
OK.
Since when does a sweater mean ���dressed up���? Am I your grandson?
As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yup, yup.
You know, you are just as dumb at night.
You in?
[comes up from under water] How was that?
No, I'm good. Thank you.
Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim?
Oh I've got him!
All right guys, clear out.
Promise me you're going to clean up.
Promise me that-
You're wearing the beanie. You like it?
I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?
Wow. Those are really nice.
Cashmere.
Can't wait.
Thanks, they're from my mom.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's her.
[laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon.
And delivered.
Hey.
Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Honey, I am not sleeping with-
That's messed up.
Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?
It has been delivered.
Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Okay, thanks.
Uh, Brandon?
Calm down, he's not.
Brandon!
[stands next to him] Right here?
How you doing?
It's how it has to be.
Me neither. Come here. [she hugs Darryl, and Darryl smiles behind her back]
Hey, Darryl.
Can I help you?
Yeah, that's true.
Ok, thank you. Is that all?
Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
No.
Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out.
Okay.
Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work.
You're not. I believe in us.
OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.
Great. It was really fun.
The Doc crew���s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
Come on.
