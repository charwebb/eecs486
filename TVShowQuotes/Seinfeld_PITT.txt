Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.
Charmed.
The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes.
No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.
Grace, yes.
Some grace, yes.
Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.
Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
No.
No, I don't like them.
They're too tight.
There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more).
They're cutting off the circulation.
Hello?
It's for you.
Tomorrow?
But I was hoping for my new socks today!
I'm sorry. I must have them today.
Elaine!
It's good, but...
Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
For a while, yes, but not in the long run.
Oh, forget about those! (Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.) Why do you keep mentioning those?
I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!
One second Elaine.
Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.
Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.
(Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?
Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.
This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
I spoke to someone who worked there.
No.
Okay.
That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist.
You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.
She tried to smother me with a pillow.
