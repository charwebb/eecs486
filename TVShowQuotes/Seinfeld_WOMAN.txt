When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere...
(To Leslie) So, when's your due date?
You know the time!
Yeah. I really have to be going.
Well I won't be long.
Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?
Are you going upstairs? Tell my fianc I'm looking for him. I havelost my fianc, the poor baby.
What?
You looking for a job?
Well, you're reading the classifieds.
You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
So, you're in 'the market'?
Which market?
So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
Really?
I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
So, are they a nice couple?
What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
Well, this is where I get off.
Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
Well, I was going to say why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
Make your-self comfortable.
Oh, don't worry. I do.
Like what?
It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
I'm taking your clothes.
Bye George.
(reaches out to Jerry) Mr. O'Brien?
You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
Come here. (moves in for a kiss)
Goin' on four years.
Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
You want to give it a try?
Do you know how to double-clutch?
Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
I don't know.
I don't know.
You don't know.
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
Which one?
So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
What's the problem?
It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
AHAaaaaaaaaa! (scream)
"Seinsmelled"?
Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
Oh, oh Jerry...
What're you so tense about?
What?
Mulva?
huh.
Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
What are you doing?
Oh, I have Junior Mints.
Oh, hello.
Nice to meet you.
Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)
Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
Mm. Bye Jerry.
Oh, hi.
Oh, Nice to meet you, George.
Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's in my purse.
Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)
Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...
I had it autographed for my uncle.
(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?
What is it?
What is it?
Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)
Hmm..
(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
They're quite exquisite!
(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)
They're so soft and milky white.
It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
Thank you.
Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
Nice.
Yeah, what is it?
No.
I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.
A thousand.
George Costanza? Estelles son?
Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
Yeah, not bad at all.
Who are you?
You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
How well do you know her?
Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
(crying)
But I didn't do anything.
How did this start?
(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
Excuse me. Can I help you?
Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?
(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
Did he send you part of our VCR?
(entering the apartment) Vincent!
Who are you?
I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.
David, you are so funny.
Get the bikes.
Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?
Newman, I'm bored.
Why don't you just make another wish?
What about a shooting star?
I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
Hi. JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?
(Behind service window) Im allergic to coconut.
Where's Glenn?
Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
Yes.
(nodding) Poor. (Elaine mouths 'oo')
What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
All right, we're done. You can have it now.
Yes.
Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
