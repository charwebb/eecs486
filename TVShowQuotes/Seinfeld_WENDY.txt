Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
Yes.
Have you tried heat and ice on it?
Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.
Let me give you my card.
Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.
Bye Jerry.
Wendy.
Hi/Hey.
Oh, hi Jerry.
Sure.
(taking the bottle) Ah.
Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.
(holds out her hand) Hi.
(flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.
Well, I...
Oh, well.
(laughs, flattered) Oh, ho.
So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.
Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
Well, why not?
What, is there anything wrong with him?
Elaine?
What's the problem?
Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.
I am really glad I took the day off.
Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
I'm dropping you off.
Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way...
Right. It's only three blocks.
(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.
A delicate genius?
What's going on?
Oh sure. You have insurance, right?
How did you hear that?
I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?
Why, what's wrong with my hair?
