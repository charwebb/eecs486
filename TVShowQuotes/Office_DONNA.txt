Hi!
[laughing] Oh, stop that.
You look exactly alike.
I have a sense about these things.
You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back.
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Who took the photo?
Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is 'SEX' in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly]
[giggles] Not bad.
Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows]
Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.
Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Oh, I haven't tried those. No.
You want one?
It's like cool... 'certified cool.' I like how they say 'certified.' Like there's some consortium of... [Michael grabs the mint from Donna's hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!
Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.
Thank you. Did I... get everything?
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
No, it's just in the lot, so...
You're welcome. [they hug] You're... welcome.
Bye.
I don't have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I'm just gonna... make my way down to...
Bye-bye!
Okay.
[still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!
No, y-you were... right.
You were right.
You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
I'm sor...
Oh, hi. You work for Michael.
Right.
Donna, hi.
Thank you.
You okay?
[chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
Nope. I'm good, thanks.
I'm out of here.
You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
How could you think I would cheat on you?
That's pathetic.
When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]
I told you I like you.
Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...
Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
We're going.
Yeah.
Thank you.
No, I bought them myself.
Steamtown Mall.
You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
Uh, Franklin Mills.
Isn't that something?
Oh.
Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
Yeah, we should.
Yeah.
Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
Oh, Friday doesn't work.
Shoot. I'm working.
Well, won't you be at the concert?
Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.
How do you know?
What, what do you mean?
It's you. I'm married.
[on phone] Hello?
Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been?
Oh no.
Oh my God.
Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?
Ummm, no.
No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
