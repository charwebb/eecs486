This your apartment?
You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.
Oh boy.
Cut it up back there.
I don't think so.
Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.
Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.
Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.
Hey!
Thanks.
Yeah.
What do got over there?
Looks like a possible 5-19.
Looks like it.
This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over.
Shut up.
That's smog strangler.
Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.
What?
Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.
I got a little hungry.
Yeah! You got a problem with that?
Yeah.
What is your problem?
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.
Mr. Costanza?
You're under arrest.
Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.
Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...
(at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!
Yeah? So why didn't you?
Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!
Well, well. The 'white whale'.
(to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here!
You Cosmo Kramer?
You recognize this piece of fabric?
What?
You're under arrest.
I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..
Lady, you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey, you with the hose.
Boy, that's some cough you got there.
Your what?
You mean a purse?
