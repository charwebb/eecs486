Ah, there he is!
Depends on the firm.
Whats the matter? You need a lawyer?
So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
Oh, well...
Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular.
How about Loni Anderson?
Why, whats wrong with Loni Anderson?
So ask Elaine there for her number.
Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
Well, go up to the office.
Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?
So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
He pretends he bumped into her!
(cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer!
So, how did she find out?
So, what are you? Afraid of her?
Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding.
Quones not a word.
Are you getting that?
Should I pick up?
Ill get it!
So, howd you do?
You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.
Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
How come he gets to leave?
And its always about Jeffrey, right?
Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.
I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
Hey, thats some big job.
Are you ready for dessert?
Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
Bye, Jer.
Bye, Mr. Kramer.
You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.
You know what the flight backll cost us?
Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
I got my sport jacket.
Whats wrong with it?
What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.
Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
Oh, for Gods sake!
(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
Welcome to Florida!
So, what took you so long?
What are you talking? We use it.
Plus the insurance.
How could you not get the insurance?
Are you kidding? They built the lake.
Why should I be comfortable?
I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
(still loud) What about her?
(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? -) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
What the hell are you looking for?
So look.
Aha!
(to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?
Jack have some spong cake.
Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
What did you have? You had the minute steak?
Did you have a coke or what?
Somebody had a coke.
All right. Make it 20 bucks.
19.45$ ?
Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
Oh come on!
He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Nobody uses it.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
He gave him the pen.
(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
How the hell do you work this thing?
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
We got plenty of time.
You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
His pen.
You didn't give it to him.
Where do you come off with this crap?
You said you didn't want it!
Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
I don't want it!
You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
Astronaut?
Astronaut!
Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
What nervous?
What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
(to Jack, loud) That's what you say.
(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
Come on. That's enough, sit down!
Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
(to the chiro) Who are you?
What are you kidding me?
What'ya got leather seats here?
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
They give you that *Fish.*
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
You send me the bill.
Here, I got it.
No, no put it away . . .
Stop it.
Yeah, yeah, you make money.
I'm paying.
Get out of here.
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
Nothing nothing.
All right, all right.
Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha.
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
I'll make a few phone calls.
What are you worried about?
Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
Bring me the receipt.
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
I thought you forgot about me.
HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
Leave all my stuff here?
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
They stole my wallet.
Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed.
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
All right, Leo.
How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
What for?
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.
You're out of your mind.
Don't worry about it.
What's the difference, we'll figure something out.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
No, no, he won't let me do that.
He could wash them.
Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
You don't understand my...
What the hell is going on here?
You shoulda told me it didn't work.
Oh, it's George.
Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
Alright, let's get going.
A present?
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
You're a terrific kid.
Alright, Leo.
Jerry!
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
You believe this?
(indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.
Who needs this?
Leo, let's go.
That's terrific!
Why the hell didn't you tell us?
I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
I'm not talking loud!
I knew it, I told you!
But there are no stamps on these.
Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
nan
We can't stand them.
Well we do.
Hello Elaine
Hello.
We're going with a select charter group.
I'm ready
Ok, bye.
Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
He's wearing one.
You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
You gotta deal.
I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
He'll send them express.
I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
So much the better.
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
(on the phone) Hello Jack.
It's Morty
Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
I'm gonna explain what boxes.
Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
Raincoats.
Send them tomorrow.
Hello Elaine
(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
Hello Rachel.
Uh we'll drive around for a while.
We'll take a bus.
I'll get a book.
Boy that was some show.
"My Fair Lady"
We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
Yea
What do you mean?
You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
My idiot son could open that garage door.
Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, Jerry.
What about the end, with the list?
The whole movie was in black and white.
You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.
You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
Ya so have I
You don't think it's fair.
What leg work?
If anything you're getting too much.
That's right, they're my coats.
I'm thinking more like fifteen.
Well you're not getting thirty-five.
Ok it's a deal
(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
What?
Don't lie Jerry.
Hello
You didn't get in?
You broke the window?
Did you send them?
Tomorrow afternoon?
I told you to send them express.
So what did you do about the window?
Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
Not really.
This is it.
Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
Just watch me do my thing.
Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.
Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
I retract your retraction.
Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
Ok, let's go.
Ah, good-bye.
Alright Jer.
Buh bye Elaine
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?
Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!
No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...
Hey guys . Jerry . Kramer
Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.
Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut.
( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
I wanted a Chip Ahoy.
Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
(shout) Jerry!
What the hell are you doing here?
Boy, you are really something.
Outside? What's going on?
(laughs) Heh hah!
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
You what? You bought me a Cadillac?
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
What are you, nuts?
(to Jerry) Can you believe this?!
Yes, I do!
We're keeping it.
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
(indicating) So, how d'you like this?
It's mine.
That's right. My son bought it for me.
My son bought me the car. It's a present.
You ever see one so nice?
You wanna take a ride?
C'mon, take a ride.
Why not?
Uh huh.
(skeptical) Thousands?!
(dismissive) Ahh!
Could you believe that guy?
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
What was that?
What're you talking about?
Stealing?!
My son bought me that car!
Yeah.
I tell you, he bought it for me!
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
If they get the votes.
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
I did so thank him!
Ah, he's deaf anyway.
Who's that?
Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
That's a good idea.
What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
There she is.
Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
Jerry's a comedian.
Jerry, don't go.
Alright, are you ready to eat?
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
Always, Jerry. Always.
Hello Jack.
Yeah, so?
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
We'll see.
Nervous, Jack?
Because I have the votes.
Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
But it comes on 1130.
How long they been doing this?
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
Wrap it up, we'll take it home.
Hello.
Well, we just bought a new place down there.
What?
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
That's right. They went like hotcakes.
Got lucky.
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
Hello?
What do you want?
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
Hello, Jerry? It's your father.
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
What was that?
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
Why would he mind? We're his parents.
First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
Who is it?
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
I don't see envelopes!
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
It's too much car, Jerry.
I don't think we even use it.
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
Hiya Kramer.
Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
You just heard about this today?
You know that number?
(surprised) President?
That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.
I'd have to go back to work.
Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
What's not to understand?
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
You sell clothes here, don't you?
Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
Who's Mr Fancy?
(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
What?
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
When are we gonna tell Jerry?
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.
And smart! Like a computer!
Hey, George!
How're your folks?
What did you say?
Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave)
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
What?
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.
See that? You couldn't do that.
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
This shirt will never leave my body.
(without looking up) Who are they?
(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.
Yeah. This is all big crepe money.
This was a gift from my son.
Call an ambulance.
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
Helen, will you stop bothering him.
Number One, signing off.
No, we just came for the funeral. `
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
And every morning I eat a plum.
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
Hey, Mr. Kramer!
No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
Tell him to eat a plum.
Plum...(Jerry hangs up.)
(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
This looks like too much money.
You think it's hot?
Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
We'll round down.
I was never impeached! I resigned!
Pinko Commie rag.
I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
Daily what?
Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
Congratulations, Mr. President.
What are you talking about?
This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.
Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?
You didn't have a deal?
You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
She's got priors.
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.
They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
Jerry, you ever watch that?
What's all that?
You're packing cereal?
You got enough here for a life sentence.
So bring a snack-pack.
