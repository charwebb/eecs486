My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
Hey.
Sure.
No.
Stop...
Kevin! That's inappropriate.
It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
Nothing, Kevin.
What about the surprise?
What?
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
What color do you guys think?
I think green is kind of whoreish.
Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...
No, it's ah...
Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
What is this?
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
You're ahead.
This is a cold pack...
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
Is that really necessary?
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
Yeah, uh no.
Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal.
No.
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
Email forwards.
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
It's fake.
She wouldn't do that. She's a Senator.
You
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
I'm sure.
I have one, yes.
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Apparently.
It's not an office expense.
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
Okay! Everybody!
Do not panic!
Safety partners.
Do not panic.
Go in single file lines.
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
Go, let's go.
Alright, let's go, let's go.
Come on, you're safety partners!
You're safety partners!
The Bible.
A Purpose Driven Life.
No.
The DaVinci Code!
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
My name is Angela.
You can't go in yet!
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
Yeah.
Yes.
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
Yeah.
But we don't keep two sets of books.
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
... that has three people...
... doing the work that could be done by two.
Those aren't chips and dip.
Uh!
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
And I made cookies. Same category.
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
Yes.
Have you signed the expense reports yet?
Michael, did you finish yet?
This is illegal.
Do you think he's signed them yet?
Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl?
I don't know why I write my name on things.
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Sometimes you talk to us real close.
Well, when you have coffee breath-
It's hard.
I know.
Hi.
It's ok.
No.  Are we supposed to?
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
I'm just leaving for the day.
Charity.  Bake drive.
No!
No, I'm not.
I got sap on me.
I'm a vegetarian.
Guh.
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
We'll see.
Fifty.
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
It sounds mean.
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
What is that?
There should be some ..
You behaved very badly tonight.
Hey, come inside and talk to me.
I think you've had enough.
It's alright.
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
Hey!
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
I, barely know him...
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
He's out sick.
I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look]
This is from Hooters.
Did Toby approve this?
It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy.
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
Were you?
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
You could out-sell Michael any day.
[disbelieving] Really?
I've seen some of your spreadsheets.
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
Are you married?
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
Really? Well, I hope I do.
Nothing for me?
Are we out of jobs?
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
Can you put that down there?
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
No.
Absolutely not.
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
I'm the head accountant.
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
No. This is a closed door meeting.
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
No.
No.
[grabs cake] Oh. Thank you.
What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
Fine.
Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.
[whispering]
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
I understand.
[smiles knowingly]
I don't take any prescription drugs.
[Gives Dwight a knowing look]
No, not at all.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
You're not going to get my permission on this.
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
I didn't get mine yet.
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
That's... no...
How about, I leave it up?
But, it...
Oh. Thanks.
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
You already did me.
Yes, that's the problem.
What?
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
Then roll an eight.
Good luck, Dwight.
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
Watching some of your friends.
Judges and juries!
Sign.
But I don't understand. It's for managers.
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.
That town is full of history!
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
D?
Sign.
I don't approve.  I don't.
[walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen.
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
You know she has it out for him now.
Dwight, you should be running this office.
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
Congratulations Dwight.
It's really happening!
We can make a difference here.
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
[shakes her head disapprovingly]
Hi.
I do not wanna talk about this.
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
But...
[quickly] Amen.
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
Sales take a long time.
I'm sure Dwight will protect him.
He's not weird, he's just individualistic.
You're a freak!
Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
How many gods do you have?
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
I find this incredibly offensive.
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
No seafood.
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
No.
Yes!
Oh.
I do like it, actually.
Thank you.
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
You need a hair cut.
His hair's flipping out on the sides.
Oh, my Lord.
Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
Last week.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Hmm.
Andy?
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
Don't encourage him, Dwight.
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
No, orange is whorish.
It would never work here.
No.
God help you.
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
Two hundred dollars.
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
Phyllis?
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
No, it's an invitation.
Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room]
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
Where's Dwight?
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Did you have fun at Benihana's?
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
What are you...?
And what...
No she shouldn't.
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
They're Sugarplum fairy wands.
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
There's no fizz in this punch. Phyllis!
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
Did you try the petting zoo?
No, I didn't.
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
I tried. We didn't have time.
What?
They arrived this morning.
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk]
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
Ok.
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
Mmm-hmm.
Well then. Have a nice day.
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
Oscar.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
Yeah.
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
Thank you. [sniffles]
Never.
Yeah.
Oh. [hands Pam tape]
No.
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Yes.
None of them. Especially not Andy.
Are you enjoying your fiesta?
Welcome back.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
Sparkling cider is very good.
[Spits champagne back into her glass]
Thank you.
Hi, Dwight.
Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
Don't Meredith.
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
In a general sense.
No thank you, Roy.
Why wouldn't we come?
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
You saw it?  Describe it please.
Oh...
[flustered] Well... good for Dwight.
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
Mm-hmm.
[flustered] Goodness.
You're useless.
Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings]
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
Mm-hmm.  Tales of bravery.
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
This is just offensive.
[walks around Andy's new car keying it]
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
OK, it's three forty eight.
Let's do it.
Kelly's training us?
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
[on phone] It was an unfortunate error.
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
Kevin, what's four plus seven?
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
You two are apes.
I'm sorry... that you're both morons.
I called you morons.
Mm-hm.
Alright, I think I'm trained.
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
Gladly. I quit.
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
I didn't apologize.
We're not.
Don't!
Fine.
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
Phyllis. You're a married woman.
What is so funny?
What a surprise.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
This is not work talk.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
Thank you, Michael.
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Everyone put on sunscreen.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
I don't understand what you want from me.
Sorry! Bye, Andy!
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.'
Why?
Wha? Who gave you that advice?
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
How can she make you get back together with her?
I can't, Sprinkles is sick.
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
[sighs] All right!
Hey D.
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
I have to visit the alchy.
I wouldn't put it past her.
I wrote it out.
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
Hey.
Any problems?
What!?
Sprinkles.
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
[sobbing]
Alright.
[still sobbing]
[nods]
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
You never... you don't like them.
That's why we're cursed.
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
[sighs]
Shut up.
Oh, really?
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
No.
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
What does that mean?
You did kill her!?
You put her in my freezer.
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
You! [hits Dwight]
It's OK.
It's nothing.
How could you do that without telling me?
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
You don't understand.
Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
What do you want?
Oh, what is that?
Her name was Sprinkles.
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
Yes.
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
Very much. How's your meat?
I heard a joke today.
Yes, it was.
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
Thank you.
Is that all?
Elevators.
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
Good.
[walks away]
Waste of time.
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
I don't care, but yes.
I don't care, and you won't.
I won't be watching, and I won't.
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
It's supposed to say launch!
I care!
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
Is just looks bad.
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
Goodie.
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
There's still an hour.
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Hello, Pam.
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
Let me know.
Thank you.
The party starts in an hour.
Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
Something made of ice?
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
Chocolates?  Someone famous?
Cool music.
Confetti.
Go-Go dancers?
I can't do this.
I can't do it.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
Ow!
What?
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
I have to hang these.
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
That's why you're not in charge Meredith.
How did you, um, where did you...
Will you help me put it over there?
Okay.
Ow! What are you doing?
I didn't ask you to scratch it.
I'm not dating you.
I have to go clean up after the party.
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
What about my cherub figurine?
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
Fine.
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
Lacrosse, the sport?
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
Yeah.
No.
No.
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
That's not happening.
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
What?
I don't like it. [Angela leaves]
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
[calling in, unseen] I have next meeting!
[Michael tries to hug Angela] No, no.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
I don't know.
Another clue, another clue.
Those aren't helpful.
You shouldn't joke about that.
So you keep a very tidy house.
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
Yes, What are you doing here?
I hate beet salad.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
I don't think that this is---
I don't.
A Catholic schoolgirl?
A nun?
It's ridiculous.
I'm right here.
We get it.
Yeah, neither did I.
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
Mmhmm.
[laughing] It's a man eating cat food.
Extension 128.
No.
Bless you.
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
Michael...
No. You know-no!
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
I shredded it.
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
...Okay.
I said, okay.
No.
[sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God!
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
Deep fried Twinkies?  It's gross!
Yes.
What?
No. No.
I don't care.
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
It doesn't matter, Michael.
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
But he's an idiot!
Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.
Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
[Dwight slaps her butt] Hey!
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
It's not my problem. [dials phone]
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
Really?
Mmhmm.
The guys?
Mm-mm
I don't think that...
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
Michael wrote down 'Astird.'
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
That's Phyllis.
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
Well, it does.  That's me.
Yes it is.
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
You gave birth in a tub?
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
Now. Come on, up here!
Your hand's in it.
Yeah, that's a good one.
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
Kevin, relax.
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
I never felt safe here.
I would very much like that.
Yeah.
I think you have me confused with another person.
I heard you. [quickly walks away]
What are you doing?
Not here.
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
He's just trying to push your buttons.
Great, then it doesn't matter.
[reverently] He is fiercely intelligent.
He's just....
Why are you doing this to Andy?
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
[sighs] Yes, that's true.
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
Pay him whatever he wants.
Be good.
Meaning what?
[on phone] Hello? Hello?
What?
Are you drunk?
I know who this is!
What?
Are you drunk?
We will discuss this later.
What?
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
Hmm, I liked it.
I think Andy makes an excellent point.
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
Manure. Get rid of it.
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
Honey, say something!
No. I haven't thought of it.
I would like cat.
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
Yes it does!
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
It's beautiful.
[to minister] Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-
I work with Dwight.
I do.
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
What do you mean?
Dwight! That doesn't count!
No, it doesn't!
I didn't-
We are not married.
Take this thing. [takes off twine ring]
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
It's the nativity scene.
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
But--
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
I don't--
Please stop making me do these things.
But it's the season of mercy.
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
It's outside.
Shut up.
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
I think I'd like to go home now.
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
That's enough.
What is it?
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
You're expanding on your worst idea.
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
[sighs]
We can talk right here.
What have you heard?
That doesn't sound like me.
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
A little bit.
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
Michael.
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.
I said nothing fancy.
I love you.
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
I'm not voting.
Oh my God.
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
Did you bring your jerky in again?
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
Oscar.
Oscar!
Pull me up!
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
What is that?  What is that?
Michael!
Michael.
Oh my God! Dwight!
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
Dwight!
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
Seven thousand dollars.
I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
Mm-hmm.
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
And person.
[gasps]
No!
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
[meows like a cat, then hisses]
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
I guess I have.  Huh.
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
That is so unnecessary!
Thanks again, Charles.
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot]
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
These are for employees only.
You're bad at this too!
Charles, where were you born?
Sounds fun.
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
What do you hear?
Okay.
People are dressed inappropriately.
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
Meredith, too far!
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
Come.
Kevin, come.
Kevin, come.
Come on, right now.
Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
Wha -
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
Completely unacceptable.
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Stop!
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
No. You need to sign them all.
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
I can play.
Rolph, did you not hear me?
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
Want me to say it again?
No. We heard that about Jim.
How is that a bad rumor?
I knew it!
Rude.
Mmm hmmm.
Pam, my bag was there...
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
What are you talking about Michael?
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
This is how you make this important decision?
Decent people everywhere will get offended.
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
Really, Pam...
Ow! He pinched me!
And where do you think you're going?
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
Are you sure?
It'll be fun.
[sees Kevin's toupee] Oh my God.
Yes.
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
I have some ideas about conservation...
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
Well, for our profit...
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
Black widow.
Why isn't Jim wet?
So you fell in?
So a child had fallen in?
That's never the case.
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
Why?
I was.
Why'd you stop it?
No.
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
Put your hands in your pockets.
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
I don't like my character.
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
Don't just say things.
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
Yes!
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
Amen.
It's fabric! I really wanted this.
Andy, is this you?
Are you serious?  This is so offensive.
If you know something Michael...
Come on!
Thank you.
Have a great day.
I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
That's your toast?
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
Excuse me?
Good afternoon.
What is this?
Of course.
You know I was thinking...
Agreed.
Jedediah.
Jedediah.
No Star Trek names.
What if it's a girl?
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
No.
Absolutely not.
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
I look forward to it.
Goodbye.
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
In your nose?
Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
Do you have any pastries without fruit?
Ow!
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
This looks like a hoot.
Whack.
Okay.
It's no worry.
I could see enjoying that.
But we signed the contract.
We both-you didn't dup-
Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
Did he not tell you that?
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Dwight?
You'll see me in small claims court!
This is my favorite day.
Psst. Hey. Erin.
You embarrassed me earlier.
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
[removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!
I knew it. You should see their baby.
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
No.
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
Same page. Go to the next one.
What?
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
I want eye contact.
Yes.
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
No.
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
Well, it better work.
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.
It does!
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
Michael, do something.
Thank you.
[coughs for attention]
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
What the hell is happening?
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
Thank you.
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
Oh, Dwight, just move.
Come on, Dwight.
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
Where's my car? Come on.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
Well, I won't tell if you don't.
Good night, Dwight.
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
What?
Yeah, I can see that.
So, what happened?
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
Well, this is intimate.
You don't know them all?
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
What? Kevin!
Did you think I stole your baby?
Someone put them in my bag.
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Are you going? [to Dwight]
I would watch that.
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
What are you doing here?
Are you authorized to do this?
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
You know what Pam just save it.
Nosy?
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
No, I meant... [motions you and me]
Mm-Hmm.
Perfect!
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
It's a new corporate policy.
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
Dwight?
Sure.
Probably.
Mm-Hmm.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
Oh.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
Thank You.
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
You never told us to close them.
Michael do something about this.
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
Nothing. Should be fun.
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
The senator.
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
No, don't throw those out!
We can save that.
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
I don't think that's appropriate.
Yes, he is.
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
I'm so glad you could come.
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
Yes.
Mmhmm.
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
I am.
Zip it, Meredith.
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
Yes.
Good morning.
The glitter is blinding.
Yes.
My boyfriend.
Ugh.
Oh, God.
All right!
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
Uh-huh.
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
...but it's totally inappropriate.
No, stop! Just don't.
God! Kevin!
Dwight!
With who?
No.
[cutting in] No! Don't!
Will you marry me?
Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
Please.
Everything.
It's an experiment.
The dream team... and Meredith.
It was just you...
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
Yeah. [Oscar shakes his head no]
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
Good God...
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Andy, what are you doing?
No.
Amen.
Thank you.
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Seven, two...
Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
Nine, eight, five...
Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
Two, one...
God!
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
Hmm.
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
Did you guys figure it out?
It was excellent.
Bye.
Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.
No, he���s fine.
He���s always been like that.
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
Great.[Angela walks away]
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
Maybe.
In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
I already did.
Fine.
Sure.
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
Yeah. And I said sorry.
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
Phillip?
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
It's after my cat.
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
Little Cici asleep?
Such a precious little angel.
Cecilia....and Phillip.
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
I know. I'm taking them down.
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
Oh, no.
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head]
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
Six-seventy, six-twenty.
yes!
Ohhhh!
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
Enough Oscar, enough.
This is all pathetic.
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
Yeah, it is, Andy.
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
You're in my way!
We're in the pool!
Oh, it is warm.
Yes?
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
Hey.
No, you will not.
Mm-hmm.
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
Aw, preemie pajamas!
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
Shh.
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
Ah!
Really?
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
Dwight?
He's hungry.
No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
You won't see-
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
That is completely untrue.
I did not. Uh-uh.
That didn't happen.
No! Stop it!
Dwight.
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
I will not.
I will not, it's not-
Yes, yes. He's sleeping.
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
My baby is not a monster!
So cute.
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
That is where we disagree.
My Phillip is crawling.
No one said 'you must have two'
No thank you.
Unbelievable!
Stop it.
Stop it.
Paid.
Is this spicy?
1434-967, paid.
Black eye, Meredith.
Yes.
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Yes.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
Thanks.
Let���s go Kelly.
So, he's alive.
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
Ugh.
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
Pam, we have a great idea.
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
Okay.
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
Nobody's named Monday.
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
On it!
You got it.
What are you doing?
Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
Ugh.
Ugh. Eww!
Oh God!
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
We think you might kill Robert.
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
No thank you.
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
Heh.
Dwight.
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
[Phillip cries] See the duckie!
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
Uh-uh, leave us alone.
Dwight, we're fine!
Oh no. [laughs]
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
No! God, Mose! God!
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
Where is it?
How long does it take to get the results?
You're gonna wait here?
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
Please, after the turtle?
Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
Why do you want this cat?
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
Have you taken any concrete steps?
Allergies.
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
Please don���t teach the cat French.
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
[to Kevin] Language.
Oh!
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
Has she done the pageant circuit?
Ew.
Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!
Ooh!
Oh my god!
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
The senator will be joining us later.
No, it wasn���t.
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
What does that mean?
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
That doesn't surprise me.
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
What?
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
Honey! What are you doing here?
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
Hi.
Spring cleaning?
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
I think the senator is having an affair.
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
I don���t know.
Right.
Right?
What?
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
Where?
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
Ow.
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
What?
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
[ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
Is it cool in here to you?
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
Thank you.
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
[upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh!
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
Something like that.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Ow! Dwight! Ow!
God!
So what are your credentials?
Do you have a gun?
What is this?
You don���t carry it with you?
Obviously.
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
Murder.
What if they deserved it?
They���re sleeping with my husband.
Thank you.
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
Yes, a knee-capping could work.
You said you would be there for me.
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
Oh, thanks, Oscar. You���re such an angel.
What? Why did you call me out here?
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
Fine! It���s Oscar. So what?
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
He���s here.
No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
No. No.
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
God! [kicks Oscar]
You were supposed to be my friend.
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
I don���t like your friend Trevor.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
Is it called red-vining?
People red vine.
No.
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
No!
No.
No, no, no.
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
Please just take my name off of everything.
Huh.
Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
Dwight!
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
Ew! Oh.
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
What do we do about our heads?
Excuse me?
Oh.
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
Okay. Oh, thank you.
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
Oh my God.
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
Sorry.
Oops.
No, I don���t��� no.
Can���t I just agree without putting my hand in?
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
Ugh!
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
Stop it!
Stop it Kevin!
Kevin!
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
Shut up!
Yeah!
What���s going on?
Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
Yes. And he didn���t like it.
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
What?
I'm his! His... wife.
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
[approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
No.
Aw, crap.
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
He's blocking me.
He put you right in front of me?
It was all my fault.
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
Uh-huh.
Ahh! Dwight!
What? What is it?
Dwight, that's awful.
What do you mean by ���poisoned���?
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
But I don't see how this is my problem.
Ugh.
Gah.
It's fine.
Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-
I'll help you!
Ugh.
Hello Aunt Shirley.
Oh, God.
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
Ow!
No. No.
No.
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
Spray her down?
You have to use chains?
Dwight!
No! No!
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
No Dwight!
No, Dwight!
No Dwight, I won't- [hoses Dwight]
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
Good.
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
There.
You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
Mmhm.
Is it any good?
Thank you. [both laugh]
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
No, Dwight. The Senator.
I can't be your monkey, Dwight.
I made a vow. I gave my word.
Good night, D.
Do they even have a bakery anymore?
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
Uh-huh.
What, Pam?
He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
Kevin?
Some of us got both. [raises hand]
[shaking head in disbelief] No.
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
Yes.
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
What about me? ���Klokken tre pige���
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
Come on!
Oscar.
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
God!
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
Call him!
Call him! [hits Oscar]
Call him! Call him!
No you go. Hi honey!
It's Angela and Oscar.
Just a few quick things.
Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
I think we're good.
Bye!
Love you! [Oscar hangs up] God.
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
[gasps]
[gags]
Oh my god!
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
Come here, come here. Let's go.
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
Really? [to Dwight] Thank you.
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
Whoo!
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
Yes!
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
I guess.
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Yes. Congratulations.
This is a big day for you.
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
Andy.
What are you doing?
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
Ugh.
No, that���s not���
No, none���No, stop. It���s just���
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
Thanks.
[crying] It���s just a really nice song.
Well, I���ve changed my mind.
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Oh, god.
You don���t want me at your place.
Well���
Thank you.
Okay.
Are you allowed to have pets?
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
[starts sobbing] I love him.
No, not the senator. I love Dwight.
Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
Daycare won���t take Phillip anymore.
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
Why don���t you pack it?
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
Ok, you go to the store.
Kevin, Kevin.
Kevin, could you not do that?
Kevin, where are you going?
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
Okay, watch it.
No, Kevin, no.
Stop it.
No, no!
Hey. You wanted to see me?
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
How thoughtful.
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
Can I go back to my desk now?
Okay, bye.
Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
Dwight?
Why?
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
Who drives like that?
Can you put that down?
It���s too loud.
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
And I lied to you.
Phillip���s your son.
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
You���re a dad!
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
I don���t���I don���t know why.
This is my big sister Rachel.
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
People love it.
What? [knock at the door] Okay.
Wait, what is this?
Okay���
Rachel, are you all right?
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
Will you lock the door?
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
Hi.
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
Do you even have a mattress?
