What?
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
Yeah?
Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red...
Oh, boy... You...
Keep me out of it.
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
I have a sports bra.
I'll do it.
Live and learn.
[whispering] It's about Michael.
Dwight, get out of here!!
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
Why were you peering over the stalls?!
You are a pervert!
You, are, a pervert!
But where would we...go?
This says 'Bushiest Beaver'.
It's, it's fine.
Dwight, get out of here!
You can't be in here!
Shut up. You're a freak!
You are...
I'm telling Michael.
I'm telling Michael.
Michael, Michael.
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
When?
All right.
All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
I'm the same age as you, Michael.
We're in the same High School class.
Michael! Come on!
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
...report you to HR.
I'll do it.
Are you calling me a ho?
What do you mean?
No.
Oh, you say that every time.
Oh, boy...
Um, The DaVinci Code.
Definitely Jim.
Come on, Pam.
Yeah, I like Oscar.
That's great!
What are you? A monk?
Ass.
Mmm-hmm.
Thanks.
That's the character's name?
Sir, you have some messages.
They're important.
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
Does he die?
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
Sure.
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
Dwight...
Oh, this isn't good.
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
I'm sorry, everybody.
I knitted it for you.
Hi guys.
Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
Yeah.
I'm bringing someone.
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
Where are we going this afternoon?
A furnace?
What does the furnace do?
Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
Are you all packed?
Maybe Florida.
[to Angela] So this is...
Oh. Someplace with a pool, then?
Michael, you should stay home and rest.
Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.
Oh, we wouldn't.  We love Stevie Wonder.
You're gonna compete against us?
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
Really? I thought they were pretty...
...and a big walk-in closet.
She's real good.
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
Mistake.
That must have been hard.
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
Isn't he sweet?
Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
I'm gonna go call Bob.
Hey.
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
Oh.
Unbelievable.
It's unbelievable!
Her nephew's in Iraq.
What are we supposed to talk about?
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
How about pepperoni?
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
Where do we get those?
Yes, it's marijuana.
It's labeled.
We don't feel that way.
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
I said no.
You're welcome.
It's not me, either.
Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
Yeah, pretty stationery.
Uh, on or off?
Okay... [removes glasses]
[leaving the room] Excuse me.
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Stanley and I are close, too.
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
I guess so...
[whispering to Angela] I don't like you.
But I didn't report your snoring-
Oh, dear.
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Afghani.
Afghani.
Okay, let's do it.
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
I have an ace.
Oh, I have a flush!
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
Ass.
I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
It's really something.
You're kidding...
Michael, what will you do?
Maybe I'll quit.
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
Okay that's enough.
Well, there is a ball.
I'm just saying hi to Bob.
What's on your suit?
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
I thought maybe DJ's.
Okay, forget it. [walks away]
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
Stanley! [hugs Stanley]
Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.
I was...
[to Pam] I'll tell you later.
What smell?
Oh, I'll help you find it.
What is it?
My perfume?
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
Oh, we find little times during the day.
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
I can't feel my toes.
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
But we invited guests.
I thought you said green was whorish.
It'll be all right.
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
I was just getting a snack.
OK.
Hi.
Oh, ok.
Cold, huh?
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
Sugarplum fairy wands.
I'll just go get a ginger ale.
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
Then how is this 'Amazing Race'?
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
Do you have a pole?
Um-hmmm.
It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.
Hey, how's Annie?
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
No. Sorry.
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
Yes, very.
No.
That wasn't me.
I thought it was...
Michael... No.
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
I do.
Thanks Angela.
I don't have that, Dwight.
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
It's fish.
You found Uncle Al!
Thank you, Michael.
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Did you see...
Mm-hmm, near the river.
Four.
Drew isn't a girl... She's Andy.
[phone rings] Hello?  Hi Bob Vance. [laughs]
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
I think I just got flashed.
In the parking lot.
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
I didn't really get a good look.
Michael.
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
Oh, it can be fun.
She does have very nice clothes.
No, the one before that.
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
My mom taught me that.
Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles]
Is there any mustard?
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
Is there any mustard?
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
What are you gonna do?
Dwight is our new boss.
I think it's gonna be Michael.
No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
Michael, what happened?
You shot Dwight?
Does it hurt terribly?
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
Oh, it's coming.
That's despicable.
That's...
Go get him Bobby!
Sic him!
Sic him!
You guys are together?
Did you plan it?
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
OK.
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Did you even try?
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
Michael.
This is stupid.
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Did you get any clients back?
Stanley, you're dancing!
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
Yes.
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
That seemed to shut her up.
Yeah, that sounds right.
He's always been terrible with money.
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
Dancing babies!
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
Okay.
Bye everyone.
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
[sobbing] No.
Popcorn.
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
Oh! [Michael laughs]
[raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.
[laughing] Thought we were playing for fun.
But it's closer to you.
Oh, we're in a meeting.
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
Michael?
I have a friend who's single.
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.
Umm I don't know Michael.
What are you asking?
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
Did the police solve the problem with the...
Elliot.
Jim was supposed to collect it.
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
Oh.
We-- we--
Well--
When I was a little girl...
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
In our neighborhood...
What did we write?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
I like your frames.
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
What consequences?
[whispers] Yes.
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
That's right. Yeah.
They make you feel lighter...
Okay.
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
Why would you do that?
Really?
Hello Angela.
Can I get a list of your vendors?
Why would you do that?
[knocks files off desk] Sorry.
Kevin, take your shoes off first!
Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
Jim, I am so f[bleep]ed.
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
Mmm, no Bob, I don't know.
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
It's going well.
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
You said fruit, Michael.
Cake.
Yes you were.
Split the commission?
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
You left me in a bad part of town!
[into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
Why should I have to thank him?
I like her purple dress.
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
No.
That can't be right.
Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.
I know, Kevin.
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
Sorry.
[sigh] What are you making?
You're making a knife with a knife?
You want to talk about it?
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
Hi.
It's nice to learn new things.
Okay.
What don't you get?
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
No, it's lettuce.
Where are we going?
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
I think it's a fun idea.
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Move on, Michael.
It's the only gavel I could find.
Oh dear.
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Now you move on.
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
I have my hug.
Okay.
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
Sure.
I'm sitting right here Dwight.
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
[to Stanley] Hey, I did good too!
[laughing] It's good!
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
On more week. [chuckles]
Dwight, stop it.
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
Where's your place?
Ohhh...
Hello.
Know what?
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
Yes.
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
I need you to get rid of the tree.
Thank you.
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
And napkins... fanned.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
Oh, sorry, it's your job.
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
Ok... nice.
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
Excuse me?
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
Wow, thirteen!
Why isn't Dwight turning around?
Andy's running over Dwight with his car.
Dwight, get out of here!
You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.
Hillary Swank.
She's not hot.
What--
Oh! I forgot my purse.
What in the name of God is going on?!
That's not a good idea, Michael.
He needs to rest.
We bury him?
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Let me get you some water.
Hey, this is your apology letter.
I hope he's ok, I feel bad.
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
She's out of your league Andy.
Sexually?
There's always a theme.
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
I know
He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
Yes I do.
[out of breath] Bowling.
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Damn.
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
It's just me here.
I think he left.
Um, let's see... it's fine.
Andy He's gone.
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
[muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.
It's really cute.
What's wrong with you?
I think you look nice.
You sound worried.
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
You mean the clients you stole from us.
It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
Those sound too harsh.
A restaurant.
Ryan, hand the phone over.
Me.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Work.
It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Oh, I'll just duck my head in.
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
Mmm-hmm.
Hi.
Hey. I like.
Oh! Mother ******!
Back!
[moans in pain]
Wow! Sorry!
It's my back.
Call a doctor.
No. Call Bob.
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Dwight! Dwight!
I do.
That feels good, Dwight.
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
But the rattler's so scary.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
Wanna dance, Dwight?
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
The girls school?
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
Oh, Lord in heaven.
Ow, my ankle!
I... twisted it.
They're not getting married. It's just talk.
There's nothing to know, it's just gossip.
Teri's out of town, Michael.
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
How far along is Pam?
We have a right to know.
Congratulations!
Again with the cousin.
What's happening to you Michael?
What's going on?
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
Perfect. I hate registries.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
Good. Good.
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
Not according to the beans.
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
Yeah, I would, too.
I say no.
Michael!
Come on! This isn't fair!
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
Now this is getting ridiculous.
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
So he won't get caught!
Disgusting...
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
Wow. Sounds scary.
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
We're not mocking, we're watching.
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
Yes. Put the DVD in.
This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
Holy crap.
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
What does that mean?
Michael, I was doing so well.
Well, I guess that's not-
Lose the twirl.
Yeah, good. Don't do it.
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
It's not like you can fire people or anything.
Ryan.
Sorry. Plastered.
What's 'Scott's Tots?'
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
That's fair.
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
Ooh.
You didn't decorate it?
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
Yeah!
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
Yeah.
Well?
The only Santa.
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.
How do you know it's a gun?
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
And this brings us to you, little one.
It's a secret.
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.
What?
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
No Bob, we worked it out.
I'm sorry,
I'm really sorry. It was earlier today.
Hi sweetie.
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
No.
I did.
You don't even like us as friends?
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
No, it's 4:35.
Good luck!
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Hey!
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
What are you -
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
What are these for?
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
I think you're remembering that wrong?
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
Okay, fine. Cash it is.
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Ten...
Eleven, wow!
One more, one more! [cheers and applause]
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
Hey, you two having fun?
Say 'Me eat cookie.'
Mm-hmm.
I don't get it.
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
Oh, Michael.
I don't think he'd do that.
Oh Michael.
Hey!
Was there a fistfight?
And it didn't change your mind.
Michael, that's awful.
Yes.
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
Awww, it's kissing its mommy!
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
Luke? Luke!
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
Go get 'em Dwight.
It's nice, like Up.
Found him!
Your show was really great, Andy.
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
Yeah, I got stung up my dress.
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
That's no pimple Michael.
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
What? Is Dan okay?
Yes.
Oh, that's great news for your friend.
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
I could try to seduce him.
Uh...
This is weird.
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
I don't know, they're both handsome.
I think he-
Oh.
What should we ask?
An asset!
[chuckling] Who takes a kid to Mexico?
Church isn't a party, Michael.
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
Here's her carrier, but no Cece.
[to Kelly] Who's that?
Who's that?
Which one's Glee?
You know your perfumes!
Are you alright?
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
Made love? I don't know.
I'll see what I can find out.
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
Magical...
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
What do we do? How do we stop this?
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
I am jumping.
Yes, I'm jumping.
Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.
Oh God.
Oh, don't be such a baby.
What's the case, Toby?
So is it an open relationship?
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
So you went homemade this year.
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
Are you good at homemade?
Yeah...
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
I think it's good.
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
I'll talk to her, Michael.
Why wouldn't she?
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
No.
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
A lot of mines in Scranton.
I'm out too.
Hmm?
Wow.
C.C
[whispers] I'm clicking!
I am clicking.
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
Yes.
Yeah, who wrote it?
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
Yeah, there you go. [laughter]
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Yeah mostly.
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
Mmm, whatcha got?
I love their breadsticks!
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
Yeah that was a surprise...
Please Michael.
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
It's cute. [plays with it]
What does that even mean?
[to Dwight] Do you believe that?!
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Oh no, they're still not done.
[raises hand] Here.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
That's true.
He means the ice pack.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
How's your hearing?
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
[also to Darryl] Good morning.
Did you have a nice drive in?
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Mm.
Yeah.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Bestiality. Yeah.
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Then what was this all about?
Yeah, it can���t be nothing.
Ahhh! [falls out of chair]
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
Thanks guys.
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
Completely.
Well, what about the other guys.
Whew, well. I guess that���s that.
Good night, Andy.
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
Ooh, why is it shaped like that?
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
Wait���.they���re terrified?
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
What else you got?
Just wear one of your bowties.
That's still a lot of money!
Yeah.
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
No..we don't
Yeah, I lost my client.
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
Yeah, what's the reason?
Yeah, it's just a picnic.
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
Who?
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
Wait, they have food there?
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
Is she Asian?
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
Hmm.
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
We did our best.
Yeah you have this sexy glow.
No we���re not.
Or should I have corndogs. I mean-
Well, this could be fun. I-
I'm in too.
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
Yeah, sign says 'Begin tour here.'
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
Oh, I like Olive Garden.
Open the door, Jim.
Are you sure? Yeah, it's locked.
Ow! Ee! I sat on my sandwich.
I don't get it.
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Is that ladle stainless or...
One, two three! [group takes shots]
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
Is that Cici?
That's awful.
Dwight?
He should pay.
What?
Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups]
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
Oh, I don't think you're being silly.
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
How was jury duty?
Did you send him to the slammer?
Oh, I'd love to but, um-
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
Yeah.
Why?
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
Cookies?
Oh.
No, just go home.
Just go.
Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.
Are you glad to be back?
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
No way.
Do you have a black eye?
Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
[laughs] Yeah.
Oh. [looks away]
Make them kiss each other.
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
Yeah.
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
Pam.
Really?
Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
He does have a moustache.
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
On purpose.
Order carrot cake. [laughter]
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
Welcome to your party.
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Oh, the plants are gonna love this.
I actually sleep better when it's raining.
What do you mean?
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
What's he doing?
Oh.
[laughs] Yeah.
Is it true you're buying the company?
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
Helpless.
Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?
You think that Andy's family owned slaves?
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
What's going on?
[Gasps] Oh my god!
Oh, I know I'd be more productive.
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
Role call.
Don���t you have any sunblock?
No, hey, Dwight shouldn���t...
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
No, she is the boss.
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
Yeah.
How much wine do you have?
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don���t know.
No. Jim... [wine bottle clangs on plate]
No, there���s wine in here.
[to customer] Can you help me?
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
Got it.
We���re gonna cover for you, ya know.
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
We already said no.
Let's do it!
Dwight said it's 'Hog maw.'
It's the lining of the stomach of--
Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.
Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
I'd rather have the bowl.
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
What are you wearing?
You got dumped?
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
Val.
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
We think you made a big, big mistake.
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
I have ears, Dwight.
Clark!
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
What? [everyone is confused]
Hey, where���s my ring?
We don���t work for you!
Wait. This says ���Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge���?
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
David Wallace called this meeting?
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
Oh...
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
Andy.
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
We started selling balloons.
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
Andy!
What does that even mean?
Put it down.
Put it down
See?
Told you so.
Come on Andy, they're a good match.
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
It looks pretty black.
Why are you here, Todd?
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
OK. Packer can go to hell.
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
What did you do, Andy?
Why?
What the hell?!
Wait, what?
Play it again.
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
[gasps] What does it say?
Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that���s-.
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
Her hair looks beautiful.
Yeah. Poor Angela.
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
What���s it now, dream or no dream?
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
No, he���s good.
I���ll try this one.
[grabbing the coffee] Hot!
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
Which thing?
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
Yeah, I���m not ready for this.
Oh, some fudge?
Thanks.
[laughing] Oh, you can afford it.
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
[hugging Andy]. Andy���
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
Poor, poor Andy.
Angela���s special repairman is here.
It���s just the wind.
Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
Let me help you us.
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
[dancing with Stanley] I missed you.
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
Cool.
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
