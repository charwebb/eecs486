Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?
What's the premise?
Fine, it's good to see you.
Hello.
Well, I, (phone rings)
 The third?
Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)
Hey! Congratulations!
No.
Oh, it was only vomit.
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
Well, it was eighteen dollars.
Yeah. Call me.
Bye.
Yu - you're passing?
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
Yeah.
Ted Danson?
Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that.
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
"The hell with them."
Those were his exact words.
He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
Pounded on his desk.
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
You said it was insulting.
Well, there's nothing I can do.
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
You'll have to wait til Monday.
(laugh) I can't give you his address.
Give it back!
What's a bubble boy?
Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
Oh.
Well, where does he live?
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
The what?
Did you ... (George grabs her hand)
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
Why?
I didn't see them George.
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
Well now what are you gonna do?
Does he have the address?
So what? You are SUCH a prude.
Okay, Come on lets go in.
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
What's the matter?
Okay, we're goin' in. Come on.
Come on George. George stop. George.
Hello.
I-I-I have no story.
Stop it. Let go of him!
It's a long story.
Smoke.
IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!
(Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.
(To George) Daddy never laughs.
Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
Uhh.. about the cabin..
Daddy..
Daddy, about the cabin..
Well, the thing is..
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
There was a fire, and it uh..
(Solemn) No. Nothing.
Hi!
Hey, Jerry.
I thought you two guys were working today.
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
George!
I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
Who's that?
My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
David Letterman's on the floor?
Hello?
What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
I'll speak to you later.
I need someone a little more stable.
People don't change.
I'm not a soft boiled egg.
I just don't think we have anything in common.
Why were there so many cockroaches?
And they got along?
George?
Renting a video! What do you got there?
This is Mona.
You okay?
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
I *know* who I'm talking to.
I liked women?
Since you and I broke up.
Yeah.
So, what have you got there?
Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go.
You're an idiot.
I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
Kramer!
You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
Yes. She's in *love* with him.
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
You think so?
You're very sweet...
Really?
What?
Nice to meet you...
Thank you...
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
Who is it?
GEORGE? GEORGE, what is it?
Uh, hello?
I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
Yes.
Yes.
George, better get ready.
You wearing that shirt?.
Did you like it?
Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
GEORGE, I'm starting it.
Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
Can we change the subject, please?
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
How was your day?
Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
You don't want to go?
So what did Jerry have to say?
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.
Yeah.
What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.
You don't love me.
My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
Are you sure?
Hi, how was your day?
Ah, it was okay. What's going on?
Yeah, sure.
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.
Well you could use a little flash.
Name one.
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
O.K.
What?
What about him?
Because he's a security guard.
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
Not really. (Walks away)
All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?
Hey, Jerry!
Of course.
Aw, what are you getting George?
Oh, George, you're so sweet.
Aww!
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
Hi, Jerry.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, no! That's too bad.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
Yeah, just tell me your code.
I want you to tell me, George.
Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
My cycles?
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
Anything else?
Hi. Here's your cash, George.
And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
Whoo.
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
Ehahh, forget it.
The vault?
Yeah, we got along real well.
Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.
Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?
Yeah. So what?
I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
Yeah.
Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here!
Yeah, look who I ran into.
What's that Jerry?
Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.
Hey George!
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.
Oh, I don't know.
Yeah.
Why didnt you give him mouth-to-mouth?
No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.
Would you two, Please?
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
Ah, no. I don't think so.
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you.
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
Mmm-hmm.
What are you talking about?
Oh, how could he be so vain?
Why not?
Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
Well, we're a couple. It's understood.
Well, you've never been a couple.
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
Oh, the poet!
So, did you get to talk to her?
Maya Angelou, the poet.
I'm going to the ladies room.
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
But you told me anyway?
Thank you, honey.
Can we stop by a drug store first?
I'm out of birth control stuff.
Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
You do? What?
The what?
Just get me some sponges, please.
Off the market? The sponge?
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
Just once...for the make-up sex.
Come on, just once?
Why?
Well, you just tear it open.
Come on, George, just tear it open.
Tear it.
Here give it to me.
Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
More wine anyone?
Hmmm?
How do you like the Merlot?
I don't know. Where'd you put it?
Well, it's gone.
Who would bring a bread and take it back?
Wanna check out a swap meet?
Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
Well, what about the flyers?
A little baby girl?
So, have you picked out a name yet?
Aww.
(warning) George!
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
Yeah.
What is that? Sign language?
Seven Costanza? You're serious?
I don't think so.
It's not a name. It's a number.
It's awful. I hate it!
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
They're gonna name their baby Seven.
I can't believe that they're using it.
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
What?
Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?
What are you talking about?
Hey, where're you going?
Elaine? What for?
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
So what does he do?
What kind of problems are they having?
Are you having an affair with Elaine?
Huh?
Hi.
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
Art Vandelay?
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
Alright.
So, was George helpful at all?
(not convinced) Yeah.
(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
The importing.
So, what does he uh, import?
Oh. What kinda chips?
Ah.
And what does he export?
(fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you.
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
(Rushing in) What? What is it?
George, it's a doll.
(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..
Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
Why?
Oh, stop it.
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
(Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
Hey!
Jerry.
Do it. Come on, Jerry.
Aww, that's too bad.
(bright) George, we'll go.
Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.
So, what colour?
Mmm.
(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
(walks in) George?
..So you're telling me the truth?
Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work.
Yeah.
There's no doubt.
Cultivate it?
I have no doubt George. Do you?
Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for ya.
David
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
George?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
I've been doing a lot of thinking about the wedding and all. and uh (George puts his head down and his hand on her shoulder as if to brace himself for something big) I've decided to go with the chicken.
Hi.
Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations.
(happily) Thank you.
June
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
Why don't they make'em anymore?
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
No. Susan.
I think I know my own name.
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
He doesn't even know my name.
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
Whadda doing?
Since when do you smoke?
I've never seen you smoke.
I don't like this one bit.
Well you are gonna have to quit.
Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
What is it?
A pre-nup?
(burst out laughing)
Ha.Ha.Ha. ha...You don't have any money. I make more money than you do. ha. ha. ha. Yeah.. give me the papers I'll sign 'em.( she leaves) a pre-nup...
Oh those are the invitations.
yeah! Thank you.
Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
Eurk.. Awful
No.
Ah, George.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
Stop it! Let go of him!
