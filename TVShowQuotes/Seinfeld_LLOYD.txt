Hey, George!
Hi.
So, I hear you're living back home now, is it?
Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? (George nudges Jerry with his right arm) Something wrong with your arm?
Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing?
This place does some business, huh?
Hey, she's a doll. (looking at Elaine)
Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you.
Well, I'm really sorry I gotta run now. (sets down his cup of yogurt and makes his way out) Well, take it easy, huh, George?
Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, "Hello".
That's right. Hey, George.
I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.
So, uh, how's the arm, huh?
Oh, his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion)
Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctor's card) So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.
Well, that's great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.
Well, it was very nice seeing you again.
Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?
She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
Oh, great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot!
Buh bye.
Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.
Name tags, hmm?
Maybe I'll mention that to him.
You sure you don't want any yogurt?
Well, it's non-fat.
Well I'm done, should we go?
Hey Kramer.
How you doing?
Hi Jerry.
George.
(offering packet) Gum?
Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.
George?
Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
No, it's no problem.
Hi Elaine.
Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.
That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?
's a great movie, huh?
Sorry you forgot those glasses.
How'd you like that gum?
You alright?
Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.
Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.
Well, if you don't want to...
So...
How about that Elaine today, huh?
(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
Anybody see Elaine today?
Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.
Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here.
I'd like a hotdog, please.
Kramer, maybe...
Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front.
I'll run in and get the gum.
Got any money?
(climbing out of the car) I'll be back.
Here y'go.
Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
Hey Kramer.
We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.
(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.
(Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board.
You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.
What do you think put me there?
Serenity now. Insanity later.
