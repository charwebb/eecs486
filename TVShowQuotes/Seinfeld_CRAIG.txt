A crested blazer..
(turning around) Yes .I Think we may have something. (picks up a blazer) The Joseph Aboud crested blazer is the finest.... That's hand ticking around the crest and these are the world famous Corriso buttons made from the finest Andulo corn.
It looks fabulous on you... shall I wrap it up?
(doubtful) A Hum!
Yeah!
No I believed you.
Oh!... hello I'm Craig.

You know your coats?
I love J. Peterman.
I especially enjoy the catalogue, those fanciful narratives really take me away..
No!!!
Well .... Will it be check or credit card?
I'll need you to write down your phone number on the check for me. (turning to Elaine) Perhaps you could do the same.
Hmmm
So did you see anything you'd like....

Oh! yeah. The Nicole Millers ...hemm.. Well the funniest thing.
I've learned that the new shipment's coming in by boat... which does tend to take a little longer with, you know ,what with the waves and all .. So you'll just have to be a little bit patient .
