I just had the longest meeting.
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
Uh, thank you.
It was you.
Yeah, it was.
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
Spicy Curry', what's that mean?
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
This is a bowler-
Yeah, but everyone else-
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
I'm okay!
Let go of me!
Definitely, definitely, Jim.
How about you Pam?
Why is that?
Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
Hi-yah!
Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.
What?
Are you going to happy hour later?
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
I thought you read these every week.
I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
Good one, Kev.
Oh, good, that was from me.
[unwrapping the poster] Yikes.
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
I will steal the iPod.
Damn it.
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
Hey.
I don't know.
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
Mmm-hmm.
Sorry?
Wait, Michael?
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
I took the tags off already.
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
Definitely some place you can swim.
Did you hear something?
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
Pam?
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
Are you moving back here?
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
[shaking head] Weird.
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He's so cute.  I like him
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
That looks, cool, where is that?
That hotel, it looks so romantic.
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
Oh, me too.
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
I mean that's a baseball term, right?
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
OK, That's cool. I completely understand.
It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
Is Brad okay?
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
Oh.
Yep. [spreads tablecloth]
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
...that I thought you should know ...
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
So, how's your day been?
Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
Second opinion on what?
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
Six.
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
So, I was looking so hot...
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
But then we wouldn't have any meetings.
Okay. Bye, Toby.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
That is so cool that you're gay.  I totally underestimated you.
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
You look so pretty.
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.
[gasps] I love it!
You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
It's
What?
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
Isn't that like your third soda today?
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
Ugh, no that thing is
[crying]
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
You told us we had to.
Because they acted all tough and everything...
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
Oh my God, I'm so worried.
I don't know. Dwight's so weird.
No, he's a freak.
Here you go.
It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
You look so handsome.
I know.
I...
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
Sparkles...
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
Don't even listen to them. They're so...
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
Like, an Indian Halloween?
Um, customer service.
What? I'm not Muslim!
She's so wonderful.
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
Jim!
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
I just told you.
Looks like salmon.
I eat beef.
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
Well that blows.
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Hello, Ryan.
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
I don't understand.
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
Sometimes.
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
Who's eating all these apples?
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?
Do you think I should diet?
No, I'm scared.
Uh huh. Hold me.
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
Eighty-six. Eighty-seven. [singing] Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine.
Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
I know but there was an emergency.
I look
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Oh, art show!
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
Hope she's OK.
You prayed for this?
Oh my God, when is it?
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
I hear whispering.
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Oh it was?
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
...and you call me, to calm you down...
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
You are so mean.
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
Oh, so I'm crazy now?
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Ryan?
What?!
Are you kidding me?
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
You're such a ditz.
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
Screw you.
Give me that thing, I want to try.
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
I know, right?  Probably a lot.
OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
[in accent] Absolutely!
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
Ask where he's from.
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
And you're sorry.
Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
Okay, role-playing time!
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
Do you think I'm a slut?
Apology accepted! [hugs Angela]
We're like best friends now!
I'll text you!
Bye, Angela!
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
Thanks, Michael.
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
[bang] Whoa.
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Hey, what's going on?
[Screams]
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
I don't want to hit the big rock!
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
Can I have a turkey burger?
Can we just take those first two things?
Team U.S.A.!
Who's Bob Hope?
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
She's from 'What a Girl Wants.'
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
Who was that?
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
Pam, he's just not that into you.
No, seriously Pam, wake up.
She looks awful.
That's Buddhist.
No.
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
Have a seat, I'll write it down.
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
[from under desk]  I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Oh.
Can we speak privately about our relationship?
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
A lot. Black guys mostly.
What?!
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
[shaking head]
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
We have a date!
You know, some place romantic and expensive.
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
I don't understand what the big deal is.
No!
Right, so?
No!
Why not?
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
Oh, he's also super-insecure about his height.
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.
If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
Waaay too tight.
Why is it so tight?
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
You had carbs?  That's awful.
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
Thanks.
Not so much anymore.
Is that traffic school?
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
Just reiterating what you said to me.
You're so funny.
I invited him.
Okay. [makes out with Darryl]
Umm, see you later tonight.
Okay, bye honey.
Ryan used me an object.
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding]
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
Guess whose boyfriend it is?
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
What?
OK. Bring it on.
Think you can handle this?
OK. Volley for serve, P. [serves]
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
Hi, Michael.
Yeah, what are you doing here?
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
Oh, my God...
She's 23.
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Now he's never gonna come.
Was he still there?
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Why would he say that?
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
Ignore her, those glasses are so cool.
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
I feel weird.
I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'
Can I be your bridesmaid?
Just leave me alone!
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
Oh, hello Ryan.  You look well.
Cool.
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
It's a small office.
...what else do people like?
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
Nope.
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.
What'd you say h[bleep]?
Oh yeah, she loves that headband.
She manipulates you.
I never know when you're kidding.
What?
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
Oh, from the insurance commercials!
So, you're dumping Michael? Smart.
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
Call your mom, Michael. [everyone talking]
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
Oh, my God. You scared me.
What are you talking about?
You always say that, and I almost never know.
Are you accusing me of something?
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
Dwight, get out of my nook!
Yeah, he's weird.
OK.
Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
I love your tie, Michael.
I was raped.
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
See? I wasn't lying.
I was lying.
No problem.
For you.  I'm with Darryl.
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again.
Yeah.
I don't know.  I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.
That's all he wrote.
Mmm hmm.
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...
We're back together again baby.
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
Oh!
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
Mmhmm.
Punch him, Toby!
Hi, Michael.
Can't do what?
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
Oh, can I come?
So you're dumping me?
Okay?
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
Yeah, shut up Kevin.
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
Dwight!
A vacation.
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
Screw you.
Oh yeah? Screw you too.
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
Screw you guys. You're dead to me.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
Ice Cream.
Stop yelling at me!
I didn't do anything!
I was kickin' it.
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
You did? I wanna see the cake.
I hate it.
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
[enters conference room]
This doesn't look good.
[shakes her head no]
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
Cool.
I love it.
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
[giggles] Thank you.
I'm too excited to sleep.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Decorating.
Yeah, thanks.
Well, his heart was in the right place.
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
She could be.
Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly]
Michael, it's time.
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
Thank you.
Should I seduce him?
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
Hey! Is that his scarf?
Michael get to the good part.
So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
So you should be heading back to your desk.
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
And...
Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Hey, guys.
Hi.
[mumbles]
Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
Stop squirming.
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
Look, I'm gonna count to 3.
No. I'm gonna count to 3.
1... 2... 3
Andy, that was just the ice.
Yeah. It was.
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
It's Eric and Megan.
WHAT??
Really?
Andy Bernard??
[mouth full of cake] Me too!
Well then, what's the one true rumor?
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
It's true!
Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.
Is Ryan going?
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
Blow my brains out.
Lame! What else you got, Andy?
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
[voice cracks] I'm so happy for you...
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
Well, I think I have that persona.
What the hell is a mallard?
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
If you take it back, I'll scream.
[to Ryan] You're so cool.
Lulu from The Fifth Element.
What keeps your glasses on?
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
Yeah.
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
It has almost no calories.
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
I'm going to have some cake.
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
Hi David! [group hellos]
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
I know, obsessed with me much?
What did yours say?
Oh! You scared me!
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
Bye, Andy. [kisses his cheek]
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
Who?
Who, what?
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
Well why don't you invite your friends?
Yeah, where are your kids?
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
It's about a family. A real-life family.
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
Why?
What drama?
So unnecessary.
I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk.
Only three tickets.
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
Me, too Oscar.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
But parody is always derivative.
Do they still get paid?
But you're an accountant too.
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
I don't know if she was white.
Yeah.
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
Just put it in your pocket.
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
Oh, that is so good.
Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
Namaste.
Hello.
Sometimes my bangs cover it.
I do find that offensive, actually.
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
Dwight: What are you doing?
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Thank you, Dwight.
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
Because I never forget anything.
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
Did Michael get them for you?
Where?
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
[opening door] Hey guys, sorry I'm late.
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
That idea sucks.
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
Ryan, we're doing the dance!
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
Yeah, your nephew is so lame.
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.
What did I say?
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
Big mistake! Huge!'
You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
I thought they were kind of cute.
Ooooh!
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
What?
Is that a blow torch?!
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
[bleep] me!
Josh Duhamel.
I get that. I get that.
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
Try 'Jesus.'
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
Finn.
Rachel.
You have to stop.
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
The show's back on, what happened?
Oh my God what song was that?
[texting] What song was it?
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
Ahhh! What's going on?!?!
Good luck Michael!
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
I think I'm gonna stay here.
I do, I do. This isn't right.
But I--it's not right.
Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
Good. And the dry cleaners?
Good.
I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
Michael, how do I create a new tab?
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
Blankets, what am I, five?
He's rubbing his neck.
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
So where's the ring?
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
This is a fast food receipt from April.
God, how many number nines did you order?
What happened? Is there a ring?
[whispering] Come on!
Wow.
Yes, I told everyone.
Oh, God, please stop!
Why are you eating stem first?
You're killing him, Michael!
Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
My resolution was to get more attention.
Cake.
Oh, baby.
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
Come on Scott, please? It's me.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah bitch.
Whoo!
Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
Ryan, I changed my mind.
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
What are you referencing?
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
Screw you man. People like my stuff.
You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]
Have we met before?
Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
And that is what you call a meet cute.
[doing make up and irritated] What?!
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
What?
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
You really would?
Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
When Deangelo's around.
All the time.
Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?
That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
You chose this job over that job?
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
He's not saying anything!
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
What was that?
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
I don't have any, assh***.
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
Yeah, it was a great deal.
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
I don't care. They can just vote.
(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
I can���t get down.
How is this a pizza party?
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Everybody hates those endings!
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It���s so gross.
This point system is really insulting.
That���s a tablecloth.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
That'll work.
Bye. [Andy barks]
Oh, god.
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
I don't get the reason for this party.
What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason?
I am so cold.
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
Well, Toby and I did, yeah.
1, 2, 3!
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Thank you. [Gabe mumbles]
Fine.
Mmhmm.
I guess.
I try not to think about it.
Never marrying.
What emails are you talking about?
That's not that bad actually.
Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
Wha���what's Dwight's mothers name.
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
[sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww!
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
Oh my God, kill me!
Yeah.
Pitiful.
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
Isn't Gettysburg like three hours away?
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
Eww, what is that?
Cool.
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
Well help me, OK? Just, uh take...
Yo.
On it.
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
And that, is how it's done.
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
What! [cheers]
Cause it's like, really...
Having fun.
Tu Bishvat!
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
Oh God. [takes off ring]
You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
Damn girl! Your body!
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
Why?
Hell yeah.
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
For you maybe.
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
We're screwed.
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
Andy, pick up the phone!
I'm dying!
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
Boring.
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
Oh, my god!
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
I was a twelve year old bully.
Yeah, that���s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
Good. Let���s go.
You think you���re so pretty! ��Well you���re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
Take that! ��Not so pre-violent anymore!
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
Oh, great.
It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
[cries, slams fist on desk] Why?
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
Which time?
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
I wasn't going to interrupt.
Ryan.
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
I do.
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
That was really cool. [they make out]
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
[tossing out winter coats] I don���t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
Enjoy the snow losers.
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
Hey, Ryan!
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
Drake is your baby���s name?
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
Oh.
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
[laughing] I love you too.
We���re running off into the sunset.
