When are they leaving?
It's been soo long.
Ok, it's only two more days.
Hi.
No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.
Yea.
Definitely
(going out the door) It's night meeting you.
Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
(Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
I'm gonna take a swim.
Hey!
Don't you knock?
What'd you want anyway, George?
We don't have any gum.
Strange man.
So where is this baby, anyway?
(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)
Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
No.
Yeah, what's the big deal?
Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
Oh, Kramer! You startled me.
Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
Why not?
C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.
Come on, Kramer.
I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
Good morning.
Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
You're right, I would have.
Yes, I do. Thank you.
Umm... This is so good.
Mm-hmm.
There's lobster in these eggs?
Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
I suppose...
(sighs) Jerry ...
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
(confused) What?
You will?
Huh?
Yeah, you too.
