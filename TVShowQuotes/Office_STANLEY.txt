It could be out of your hands Michael.
Can you promise that?
It's just that we need to know.
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
Fine. How are you?
I admire your culture's success in America.
Who am I supposed to be?
It's collard greens.
It's collard greens.
There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
Oh, thanks.
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
What about confidentiality?
We all think you don't have a surprise.
Why'd you do this?
Last year, five years ago...
I'm sorry?
Why 'of course'?
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, my ankle!
Oh, actually no I don't Michael.
[in pain] Oh. Go away.
Hmmm...
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
I think I did.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
You said, we could bring our families.
I did, my wife's name is Terri.
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
A little bit more and I would have had it.
Oscar!
Ooh.
That's one book. You've got two others.
Okay, um...
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
Okay. It's called Who Would You Do?
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
No.
To the.
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
Something wrong, Michael?
Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.
I don't care.
Excuse me?
Hi, Michael.
No. Are those purchase orders signed?
Huh? What?
Are those purchase orders signed?
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
It's all about my bonus.
I'm back.
I think I do.
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
It's fine.
Oh, good one. [laughs]
I know how to plug something in.
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
All right, I'm done now.
Stanley Hudson.
Michael.
I need to know...
What we're doing.
You said bring a toothbrush.
Is this an overnight?
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
Not maybe. Yes or no.
In January?
[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.
[gives Phyllis a look]
I'm not disabled and neither are you.
Mailboxes, Etc.
Uh hmmmm... .
I mean I'm learning nothing.
I'm on the phone.
What is?
Hmm?
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
That's not what a hate crime is.
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
Yes.
A sale.
Big.
Just big.
Big.
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
Why would this affect our bonuses?
Michael?
You said we were getting bonuses.
Cancel wallpaper.
Way to go, Ryan!
Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
She's in middle school.
Mmhmm. What?
A little fishy?
That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
Put that away and learn.
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
Mmhmm, happy birthday.
These are all the same?
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
Is that supposed to be me?
I do not think that is funny.
Hmmmpt.
Where did you get these facts?
They are not.
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
And what did you say?
Hmm.
Excuse me?
I didn't say that.
We sit close.
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
You gotta be kiddin' me.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
I am going back to my desk...
Annoying.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
But... why Dwight?
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
We do not wanna hear about this.
You have just spit on my face.
[throwing ball back] Nope.
I will NOT. [throws ball back]
No, I'm done.
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
No way.
Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.
This is Pretzel Day.
Thank you! [takes pretzel]
Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
I do not know.
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
Trust me. It only gets worse.
Fantastic.
I'm going back inside.
You can't cancel a holiday.
What does that mean?
Fruity and delicious.
I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
They said I should talk to you.
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
No.
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
Then you won't be able to do inventory.
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
There is a butterfly on this. Why?
So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
Pass.
... I'll take the kid.
You want the lead?
Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
Oh, sure, we talk all the time.
No.
[Stanley's fork breaks.] Of course.
A toaster, you?
Unbelievable.
Goooood bye.
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
Hmm, come here much?
[at the table] Oh, not again.  Melissa!
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
You must have been scared out of your mind.
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
Mm, how many bedrooms?
Is it nice outside?
Do I need my jacket?
Where's my five dollars?
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Oh, sweet mother of God.
Excuse me?
I don't care what you call my team.
No [crosses arms], the blue team.
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
[growly noises, Jim looks terrified]
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
Amen.
Liquid.
I don't want it.
Make it 100.
No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
Hello Meredith.
I'm... um, Catholic.
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
Zero.
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
So we've got what, another 20 minutes?
Hmmm...
You ran over an employee.
I don't know.
If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
It's too little. Use the phone.
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
Or him.
Yes, please let us know.
No I'm not.
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
We get to go home?
You find anything?
Why can't you guys do it?
Fine.
Why are you calling me here at home?
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
Is he right about that?
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
I think it's because of my sales record.
Money.
Money.
Money.
Yep, looks that way.
Michael?  A word?
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
Why don't you mind your business?
Booyah! [laughs]
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.'  Now pick up the ball.
[kicks ball toward Phyllis] Now it isn't.
This is ridiculous.
There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
When will that be?
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
Somebody's always got to be a hero.
Not me.
No.
Leave me alone, dammit.
DID I STUTTER?
What.
What are you talking about?
I am not going to apologize to you.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
Are you serious?
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
So I'm not fired.
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
And I think, 'there's no possible way--
He can top that.'
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
Oh, for the love of God.
Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
Fair enough.
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
Hmm?
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
[chuckling] What a messed up world.
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.
I'm taking my dumplings.
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
I don't like cake anymore
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
This meeting.
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming.
About what?
No, that was you.
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
I'm done.
Do you want us to look for 'em?
What?
I knew it. Haha! [they high five]
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
Perfect, isn't it?
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
Dwight.
Oh my God.
I'm with Pam. Chairs.
There he is!
I didn't hear a phone.
It's your job.
Eh...
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
I agree.
Mmmm... chewy.
There was a car.
What's happening?
What are you doing?
Oh, I do.
Some actress, whether shes hot.
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
Leave it woman!
I'm about to die!
Thank you, Michael.
It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
[flashback] Not maybe. Yes or no.
[flashback] No way. Uh-uh.
[flashback] Are you from another planet?
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
[flashback] Did I stutter?
[flashback] I'm done. Goodbye.
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.
I'm going to die.
Oh, I don't know.
I would die.
I'm okay with the logic of it.
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Chocolate.
It's my bio-feedback machine..
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
Yes...
No, Michael, No. [beeping speeds up]
Would ya, would ya step back please
Please. A little further.
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.
Four Splenda. Are you crazy?
Are you out of your damn mind?
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
You really like her, huh?
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
I know, I just read it on the sign.
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
Fantastic.
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
Can't you see I'm urinating?
No.
No.
No I didn't.
[holding a crossword puzzle] Yes.
Just transfer the damn call.
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
From Argentina.
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
She's upstairs talking to Charles.
I don't know. [They shrug and leave.]
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
How is that going to work?
New File System'.
I am not changing the way I do my files.
It's not right.  I don't like it.
I had Mexican food.
Who let this boy on the phone?
And me.
You want us to apologize to you?
That's right.
Are you giving us our clients back?
Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
So?
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
How did I end up back in Crazytown?
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
Goodbye. [walks away]
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
And it's been lonely.
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
I'm counting on you, Michael.
[sighs]
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
What have we here?
Co-manager of what?
Can I also be a boss?
If you don't smell this, you're fired.'
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
I got one queen size bed.
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
No.
Heh, heh, heh.
Did you say 'Koi pond'?
Michael, don't listen to them.
You just ignore their carp.
Thank you. [reaches for bagel]
Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
What kind of food?
I'm in. [sits back down]
Do we have to play?
Super.
Oh, is today Recyclops Day?
I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.
That doesn't make you a boss.
Can't say.
Has it really been ten years?
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders'
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
Not a gun.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
I have.
We deserve to know.
That's ok.
I'm going to go look at the Internet.
Hold it!
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Hey!
When are we getting to sales topics?
About time.
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
They aren't salespeople!
The Kardashians is a good show.
Not your staff, Michael. You.
If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
That is a dangerous precedent.
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
Good news that you found our leads?
Excuse me.
Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
I have an idea for your weekend.
Let me get back to my desk right now.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
It wasn't me.
[quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?
[to Toby, who's filming] You fallin' behind.
Still behind.
Are you crazy?
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
Texas justice.
No you will not.
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
Is he still doing his boycott?
You brought balloons to a play?
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
Not again...
You're always asking for our attention.
Seems recent.
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
We sell better?
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
I'm outta here.
Hmpf!
What's a seven letter word for purse?
Nope. Starts with an H.
Hmmm. [glances at Andy] Thank you.
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
Night, everybody.
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
[walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword]
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
You could feed the hungry. Us.
I...
You don't have our attention.
I'm listening.
Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
I want my money back.
Get us out of this!
It's a bad bet.
Michael, are you that blind?
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
Don't tell me how to do my business.
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
Why not just go one for the year?
I will not work in a roach billboard.
Are you trying to kill me?
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
You lucky son of a bitch.
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
Great.
I'm out.
[whispers] Click the 'x'
In the box.
Woman, you've had a computer for years!
The flirtatious tickling.
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Marry me Holly.
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
Need a hand?
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
I was.
More meetings and-
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
[angry] Yeah wow!
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
Yes, what is this about?
Mmhmmm.
Is that it?
Is that it?
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
We all saw you do it.
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
I'll get over it.
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I���m telling someone how to do somethin���. I go on with a long description and then I say, ���and shove it up your butt.��� It���s stupid, but it���s my thing now.
What?
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
What���s that?
That���s pizza.
We get that every year.
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You���re not making any sense.
How ���bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
I like what we have.
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
Just some chef.
What the hell is going on here?
How did you get in my car?
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
[singing] Closing time every new beginning���
I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now���it's my favorite song.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Goodnight.
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
Try mose1234.
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well���I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.
If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
In the African-American community-
[murmurs] Thought it was worth a try.
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
It's my birthday.
Holiday wishes.
We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
That's right. [laughs]
Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
Atlanta.
Keep talking all you want.
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
You've been meatballed! [laughs]
Are you ready for some meatball?
Look for your stapler!
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?
Good day.
We'll never have to buy meatballs again.
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
What?
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
[groans] We'll see you tomorrow.
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
EAT IT! [Jim begins eating black licorice]
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
What?!
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
Why is it so hot in here?
How did a mosquito get in here?
Mmm! [struggles] Ugh!
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
Did I say 'Messina?' [tires screech]
Get the damn phone.
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.
It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
Or do you only drink with your kids?
Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.
Aw, let him do it.
Yup.
What's under the cloth?
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy]
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
mm-hmm. [about to leave]
uh-huh.
I���m on break.
Don't talk to me.
[insincerely] Good to be back.
And we are grateful.
Who's a native?
No. Um-um.
She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
You two better watch yourselves.
Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
Oh, my god. It���s called a garbage can.
They���re like the new Jim and Dwight.
Mm, swish.
American Diabetes Association.
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
Do not care.
What's he measuring?
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
[on phone] There are a hundred packs..
Shh!
Ninety nine cases..yeah.
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
Boy, I will hammer spank your rear.
No question.
Next stop pies! [group joins in]
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
Ugh. I don���t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
Show some pride. This is crap.
Why should we help you?
When is my birthday?
I don���t know, because we���re not friends.
Now we���re talkin���.
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
I���ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
Not enough lobster. Side order.
Don���t be pushy Jim. It���s tacky.
Is it white wine?
Ooh, bring it over.
[chuckles]
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
Shuckin��� your peas.
Yeah.
No. I want Tropical Christmas.
I love Philly. Dirty town.
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.
Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.
Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
Get off me!
Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
Put those away before you hurt yourself.
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
I usually take a siesta about now.
It���s all gone. I didn���t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
That���s none of your damn business.
This is not natural.
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn���t work then. And now look what he���s doing to us.
Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
I'm the same way with horny people.
Uh huh.
That's where nosey'll get you.
Why can't you just do regular sit-ups?
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
Me too. [holds up four fingers]
[eating soft pretzel] We've all changed.
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
[humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
This is an abomination.
[drinks a 5-Hour Energy shot and groans]
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
Pass.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha���
No, you didn���t. Sick of you and your���ooh���
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
Helllloooo!
Pigeons.
Ooh-hoo, look at that baby���
Ohhh���
That���s Benji. Oh, he���s precious. That���s a healthy-looking baby.
Eee.
A beautiful family.
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
Who's Carla Fern?
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Can���t you just leave?
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
He was good.
Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
He ain���t coming.
I heard that.
No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
Hey guys.
Oh, great.
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
I missed you too.
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
Okay, I need a drink.
