What is so special about this jacket?
What's the smudge on your hand?
It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.
No, it's ok.
Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?
You look like you've got something on your mind.
How about him?
He sure does.
So, what did you think?
No, about the nose job.
Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
I know, they're good.
Really?
Uh huh.
I hate the dentist.
So you really think I should do this?
Well, maybe I should.
No, George is right. I want to get one.
George?
Enough.
Yes.
No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.
(with hand covering nose) To the doctor!
The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...
You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?
Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?
Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.
I never heard that.
We could go to the Caribbean.
George, I don't think this is working.
Hi.
(to George) Hello.
(motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.
Not sure.
(holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.
Hum! That was really good!
Oh no, I've had just enough.
No thanks.
No (with a disgusted face)
No, it's not that.
No (a resolute "no")
No.
Everything is delicious.
Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.
Mmm-hmm.
Many times.
Can we drop this?
Ah! Poppie.
Poppie, this is Jerry.
Jerry are you OK?
Is anything wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.
Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing "no") You're not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking)
That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 800. Bye-bye.
What are you doing here?
What pie?
I'm very busy here.
You better not let Poppie see you here.
Uh, who are you?
What do they want from Poppie?
