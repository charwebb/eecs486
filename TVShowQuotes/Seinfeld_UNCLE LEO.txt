Jerry, are you listening to this?
So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
No, for the walking tours.
Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?
Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation, you understand?
Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin.
Helloooo!
Come on in.
Hello Amy.
Jeffrey went out tonight.
I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!
That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions...
Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.
You know Jeffrey's favorite animal the leopard.
He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets.
Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em.
What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
Jerry!
Hello!
Your wife?
What are you talking about?
You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?
Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?
Haven't I always been a good uncle?
Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print.
I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait!
Jerry? Hello.
Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.
I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!
What kind of checks?
Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?
Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?
Hello.
I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.
She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
What are you talking about?
I want-
Jerry, would you please take it.
I want you to have it!
Jerry, take the money!
She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
Ah, she's a real tiger.
What?
What are you talking about?
Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.
I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.
Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw.
Move back with Lydia?
Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.
But she's an anti-Semite.
Hey Danny. Hello. How are you?
Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .
Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello!
I got your package.
What should I do with it?
Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of "The Mikado". I want you to go see it with me.
Okay. Opening.
Elaine. Hello. What are you doing here?
No. I am going to ask him about my eyebrows.
It was a fireball.
You're not my nurse.
Are my eyebrows going to grow back?
Elaine...
Elaine what about my eyebrows?
She left.
I am calm.
Demeanor?
What are you writing?
