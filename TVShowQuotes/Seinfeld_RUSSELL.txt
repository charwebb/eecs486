What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?
So, what have you two come up with?
Nothing?
(Unimpressed) What does that mean?
I'll call back.
(Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.
No.
You read? You read on the show?
All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?
No stories? So, what is it?
I got up and came to work.
(Confused) How is that a show?
Well, why am I watching it?
(Threatening) Not yet.
We were about to sit down to dinner.
(indicating) This is Cynthia.
No.
It's not veal.
Who gave you my address?
So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?
Blossom's on Monday.
Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team.
Alright, now look. These deals are already made.
Mister Costanza.
(to George) Alright. Eight thousand.
Thank you.
Well, come in. (They shake hands.)
Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.
Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.
Pfeiffer's.
Yeah. The food's usually terrific.
What are you saying?
Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.
Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.
Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)
Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)
Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.
Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)
Oh God. Oh my god.
Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)
It's just a stomach thing.
We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)
Get a good look, Costanza?
Oh. Hello.
Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?
Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)
Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)
No.
No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)
Field of vision, huh?
I really appreciate you coming.
All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once...
Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret)
But I want you.
Is it something I said... or did?
Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.
Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.
(a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.
(starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today?
There's a show. that's a show.
(stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.
What?
Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves)
(nervously, almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by, bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him)
All right. All right. What's your name?
Get out! You're fired!
Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do, Russell leaves)
She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me.
