Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.
Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, were in the presence of royalty.
But I didnt just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.
Yes.
Yeah, Im coming!
Do you take sugar?
Lemon?
Ah, sweet elixir. Its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.
Ah, the pastries!
I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.
How about dinner?
Oh, Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into?
Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
Give it back?
What are you talking about?
Im talking about the statue.
Give it back to whom?
You?
Im not getting this.
What are you saying?
Are you saying I stole your statue?
I cant believe what Im hearing.
For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.
Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning peoples apartments.
Whats behind this? Its Rava, isnt it?
You want her.
Shes from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!
Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
What did you say?
I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
Who is this?
Whats going on here?
Your friend is crazy.
Ive got to get going. I have a class.
Well, thats because Im registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.
You are starting to make me angry!
(to Jerry) I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
Yes?
Police?
Hey.
Murder?!
I think you have me confused with somebody else.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, are you a cop?
Got you? I dont even know what the hell youre talking about.
Look at this.
It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
Bob.
Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.
Are you talking to me?
I said, are you talking to me?
