...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.
(to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, were starving here! Weve been waiting here for ten minutes already!
I have to eat! I mean, Im hypoglycemic.
Yeah.
Do you think I need a haircut?
(to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I dont want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it.
Is there a real bird in the back?
Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why dont you do me a favor. Why dont you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable.
What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?
(laughing) Wait, youll never guess who I ran into.
He asked me if I still saw you. I said, Sure, I see him all the time. Were still great friends. Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs)
What?
Not working? What are you talking about?
How can you say that?
(starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.
Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know youre a very busy guy.
(crying) Youre one of the few people I can talk to.
I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, Im your biggest fan!
I mean, youre my best friend.
I cannot believe that this is happening. I cant believe it.
Didnt mean what?
Oh, youve been under a lot of stress.
Tonight?
Do you really want me to go?
Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, thatd be great. So, next Wednesday.
Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!
(from the hallway) Kramer.
Hey.
So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?
M-hm, Ill bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?
Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?
So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, Im going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why dont you come along?

No, there's no resemblance.
Elaine, I was adopted.
