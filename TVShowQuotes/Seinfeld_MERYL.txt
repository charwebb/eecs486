Good morning.
How'd you sleep?
I was not!
By the way, you know you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'
No, it's 15-8.
Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.
Ooh, cashmere?
Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?
Alright, we'll stop over there.
Pancakes.
I don't know that!
I'll get the short stack.
You bring your own syrup?
Oh, that's so touching.
Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.
I'm taking him to the cleaners!
Uh, would you, um...can I...
The syrup. Would you pass the syrup?
And a check for my husband.
To my adoring husband.
I like adoring.
Oh, hi...honey.
I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)
I didn't do anything with it.
It's in the first drawer.
Yes, it is.
Did I say you were stupid?
Do you want me to go find it?
It was in here yesterday!
Well, you must have done something with it!
Well, I give up.
Yeah, me too. I Love you.
Well, goodnight.
Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.
Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)
You son of a bitch!
Who is she? I want to know who she is.
A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?
What happened to us, Jerry?
I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.
Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup.
(sentimental) Okay, thanks.
Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)
