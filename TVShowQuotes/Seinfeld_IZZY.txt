Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.
(challenging) Think you're better than me, huh?
Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down) Let's see you lift that.
C'mon, c'mon. Pump it!
Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
Step aside, stringbean.
I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
(agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh.
(drawn out) Aaaahh.
What are you doing here?
What the hell is that?
That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
Oh, I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one.
It's go time.
(pained) Ahh. My back. I can't move.
Uh, oh, wait.
How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.
The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one.
Hi, son.
I got married in high school.
This is Seinfeld's kid.
(pointing) The television.
(urgent) Call an ambulance.
(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?
Okay.
My dad.
I still thought you could do it.
(chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.
Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
Yeah.
You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?
Hello, dough boy.
I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.
Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.
Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?
All aboard in the pain train!
Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?
Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.
You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)
Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!
Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...
