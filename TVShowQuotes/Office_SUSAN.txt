Hello nice to meet you.
Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
Oh, Ryan.
Hi.
I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
Well make that a red wine and I���ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there���s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don���t we just let it go.
So what happens next?
You didn���t say goodbye to your grandma.
Who walks around with their passport?
Have you had any?
Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.
Oh, that is so cute-
Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles]
Aw, let me see-
I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
Do you not want me here?
It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
But it is something.
Why would you not want me working here?
I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?
Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
Got it.
Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
You sure about that?
No games?
Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
Andy?
Why do you keep looking at my husband?
That's not true, is it?
Robert...
For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?
Jim...
Answer the question, please.
[Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]
Andy.
Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
Well, different circumstances.
Who knows?
Maybe after all this settles down...
It's a date.
