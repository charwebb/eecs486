What?
Uh, yeah. Just a fax.
You haven't told me.
Uh, yeah, the one...
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
I have an important question for you.
Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
This is Mr. Scott.
I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
You just still have these messages from yesterday.
What?
Don't we all?
Nothing.
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]
[Laughing]
Yeah.
So when are we going out?
OK. Yeah.
Hey.
Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
You got a fax.
What? Why?
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
Are you serious?
I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
You're a jerk.
Hey.
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
It's better, thanks.
Yeah.
Is...?
Um... Are you...
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.
I guess.
What?
Wired.
Oh, yeah.
Smoked turkey.
Yeah, Freecell.
I know. I saw that.
I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
Um, hi. How are you?
Great.
Thank you.
That's nice, Dwight.
OK, I like your food.
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
[stirs] Mmmm.
Oh.
Sorry.
Um, that spells incest.
It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.
Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...
Seventy-six percent. What's yours?
You're doing fine.
People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
It didn't have anything to do with race.
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.
What card was she?
I'm not making any copies.
Nothing new.
There's nothing new.
Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]
No. I have a life.
You should try it sometime.
[laughs]... your problem.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Where are you?
Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...
No you're not.
OK.
Still no one calling.
Dwight, what...
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Michael, he made huge cuts.
Where are you going?
I'm inventing new diseases.
So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
Nice.
It's an epidemic.
[on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam.
Good, how are you? Busy?
Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?
You don't have anything you're doing?
Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.
I might go to the mall.
I need new shoes.
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.
Mmm hmm.
Mmm hmm.
Yeah.
You promise these are confidential?
Did you just mark on that?
You made a 'P.'
In case I get sick.
Because we're not married.
We haven't set a date. [Dwight laughs]
Shut up, Dwight.
I'm not talking to you anymore.
Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.
Oh.
Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.
But it's not until next month.
You still want to have a party?
How about green?
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
It is... her birthday.
An alliance?
What does that even mean?
[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.
OK, yeah.
He's in a box?
[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card]
Oh, tell me, tell me.
[laughing] That's perfect!
Hey, Hey!
Come on.
It's just office pranks.
[telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.
I wasn't really going for anything.
Are you being serious?
Okay.
No one's calling.
Sometimes there's a lot of time between the calls.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
No.
Yeah, I could tell.
That was a good example.
Okay. [telephone rings]
[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.
[whispering] I'm so sorry. [Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] ... seriously, we're just...
My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.
Please don't throw garbage at me.
I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones.
Yeah, you're gonna need it.
[laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive.
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.
Woo!
Mmm-hmm.
Hey.
Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let's get you into a tub.
New pants?
Abercrombie & Fitch?
Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.
Uh, Michael?
Hey, there's a...
There's a person here...
There's...
There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.
Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.
Okay.
There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
No.
That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.
We're not dating, we're engaged.
[smiles]
[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
Oh!
Oh...
Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad.
[smiles in agreement]
You're horrible.
Yeah, what's that?
I'm engaged. So...
I wished, right?
Yeah, I gave it to you.
So, can I..? [points to the door]
[nods]
That's what he said.
[not looking at Roy] Hi.
Roy...
Cut it out.
Stop it. [laughing]
[giggling] Cut it out.
Stop. [giggling]
[breathless] Stop, I can't breathe.
Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me.  We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
I'm bored.
No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
Really?
What are you guys going to do?
That's great.
That's cool.
I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.
Cause Roy's got a truck.
Uh, huh. Yes.
Great.
Okay, I'm gonna head back.
You know Michael's been talking to her too.
What do you think his chances are?
[laughs] I like that song.
[laughs] 10 years ago.
Ugh...
You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
Michael has taped
Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.
[quietly laughing] It wasn't. I swear.
We're not laughing at you, Dwight.
Um, just something somebody wrote.
Um, it's kind of private.
Okay, now I'm laughing at you.
You're taking away our bathroom?
Michael...
...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
Um...
Sorry.
...because that's what happens every time!
No.
[Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.
If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
I'll just get a ride home from Angela.
Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping.
[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?
No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs]
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet!
More Dundies!
Fine work! Fine work Stanley!
Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]
I have so many people to thank for this award.
Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
Nothing.
What?
Dwight, get off me!
Oh my God!
I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
Um, I just wanted to say thanks.
Bye.
I am fine.
Okay.
[laughing] I am fine.
Oh, my God.
Dwight, let me up.
I'm fine.
You're holding up three fingers.
You are?
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
mmhmm.
Oh really?
Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
Thanks, Kevin.
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Thank you.
Uh... my mother's coming.
I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
[ecstatic] Oh my god!
Hello!
I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
This is where I used to keep my computer.
But then I moved it.
Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
So this is like, um, an organization station...
Hey!
Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
Mom!
No.
Ten minutes.
Then we can go to dinner.
He said what?
Good morning, Michael.
Nothing. You look nice today.
You look real thin.
You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.
Thin handsome, Michael.
We're not dating.
We're not dating, I'm engaged.
I would say no.
I would drown myself.
Hey.
I know we're having that harassment thing this afternoon.
Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.
Yeah. I realize that might be harassment.
Okay.
[laughs]
Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.
You see Dwight's coffee mug?
Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
Here.
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
Oh.
You headed out?
Ok.
Have a great time.
Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
Yup.
Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.
[shakes head]
Yeah.
Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.
In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.
The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
Go!  Go!  Go!
It's Phyllis!
Flonkerton.
Are you sure you don't want to play?
Come on Angela, don't you have a game?
Well, let's play, what is it?
We're friends.
I made something for our closing ceremonies.
Automatic voicemail.
[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet]
I have 59 voicemails.
Sure.
Really?
Cool.
Hey. Morning.
Okay. What? What is this?
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
I know. I know what to do.
Okay. Put everything back exactly how you found it.
Hey, Dwight. Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot.
Dwight, I swear, we didn't do anything.
Okay. How about skeet Schruteing?
Mmm-hmmm.
Thank you.
Oh, oh.
Oh!
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second.
Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
[to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.
...Would You Rather?
Legends of the Fall?
Well, I kind of liked Legal...
I take it back.
I take it back!
Okay.
Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
Yes. In my top three, so suck it.
Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and...
No, my all time favorite!
All time favorite.
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
You should tell him.
Dwight.
Kay.
Hey!
Um... Oscar's kind of cute.
Ooh, Toby!
I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
That's here.
I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.
Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.
[chuckling]
You're not stuck.
Really?
Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
[entering] You wanted me?
[notices Michael's costume] Papier-mache?
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Why did you put it off until Halloween?
I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
So it's a man?
I just answer the phone.
You're costume is fantastic! [laughs]
Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay...
Okay, greatest strength.
A dog-like obedience to authority
But that doesn't sound good.
He's a gun nut.
No, I made brownies.
... What?
I made brownies.
I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.
Jim...
What happened?
Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
It's just last year you...
Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
Well, is that really a priority?
[Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
I am just following the website.
Yes, you have very nice teeth.
Could you practice on the forms?
I don't know.
French Onion?
Ok.
I just have a quick question.
No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
He's a purple belt. That's really high.
It's just out there, you...
Yeah.
What?
Well, look closer.
Once point for me.
Oh, you're dead.
Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
Yeah, you too.
The shipping place closes in a half hour.
This is what you had Ryan do.
Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?
Wait, are those Michael's Levis?
Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that's why he started casual Fridays.
[to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]
What is going on?
Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
No, they had to come back for me.
Umm... it was not that long ago.
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em?
Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
When-
Ok.  There's a transcript between a naval ship-
Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
It is a screenplay.  Starring himself.
Of the FBI.
What is that?
Hey, uh, I have to work late.
Here's what we think happened.  Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.
Yeah.
For the bugs.
Yes... nice!  I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
What are you going to do with your time off?
[points to Jim's iPod] You have new music?
What!?
Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan's cell.
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
Oh, really?
Why might some say that?
Uh hmm.
We didn't dance.
Swaying isn't dancing.
I have some faxes to get out.
Hmm...
Hi.
I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk.
Yeah, do you mind leaving?
It's very important.
Thank you.
Oh! So close to retirement.
I sincerely doubt it.
It's performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don't really know what to expect.
Thank you.
Oh, no.
Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.
She missed you.
I have one idea of what it means.
Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
Because she's conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.
Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
Michael and Jan definitely made out.
Maybe more.
Oh, yea!
Michael?
Jan's on the phone for you.
Sorry.
What suggestion box?
Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
Sure.
Hey, Jim.
Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?
Can you believe who Trump fired?
You didn't see it?
Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
Everyone's waiting in the conference room.
Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
How do you come back from that?
No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
As a human being.
[Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.
He sees it.
Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday...
I almost lost it. That was too good.
You mean yesterday's paper.
Thank you.
[whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
I know!
Do you think that they're like-
No, right, no, no.
Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?
It's like squishing a spider under a book.  It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead.  Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ?
Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
Ummmm...
Hey, Angela-
How's it going?
Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?
No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.
Oh.
Yeah.
The professors would go to the parties?
[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
Really? That's great.
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
Oh, no, he can't make it.
No thanks.
Hey.
Definitely.
Jim's bedroom.
Cool... This is your desk.
Your home office?
Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here.
And Dwight would be like-
Umm, [gasps] yearbook!
[finds Jim's picture] Ooooohhh no!
You were so dorky!
Hey Phyllis, come here for a second.
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
That's ok.  It's ok.
Oh, yeah I gave that up.
Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
Hey, Michael, accounting needs your approval on-
Hi!
Good.
Thank you.
We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim's house.
Uhh...
I might be late.
Ok.
[to the cameraman] Did I miss anything?
You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
I think the tree looks nice.
[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
Yeah, we call it White Elephant.
I'll take the iPod.
I want the iPod.
Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..
Sorry, I ..
Maybe because you hated her present so much.
How much?
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
So what are you going to get me instead?
[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]
I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?
Do you want me to help you with that?
Yes.
Are you kidding?
Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.
It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.
Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.
Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.
I love these.
Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
A ski mask and a swimsuit.
And brush our teeth.
How about the anchor?
I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
No, I'm not going to do that.
Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?
It's getting kind of rowdy down there.
Sometimes I just don't get Roy.
I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?
I'm cold.
Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.
No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
No, thank you.
How about the anchor?
You've been to the lake before?
Yes, you should have.
Love you.
Yeah.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Michael, what's wrong?
Ok, wait wait wait wait...
Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
Ok...
Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
[exasperated]
Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?
What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window]
Ohhhhhh!
Oh my gosh.
Is he ok?
You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.
You didn't have any.
And do my job?
It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
You've seen one of these?
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
Really?
Oh! Ha, haha.
Pan?
Oh, God.
[phone rings] What.
Tell me before I come there.
No.
No.
Really?
What?!
That is so cool.  Thanks Dwight!
Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!
No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.
Wow...
Dwight, you have your hand up.
Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.
Get up, get up.
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
I just want to say goodbye ok?
Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.
It's just hard to explain.
Oh my goodness!
Come here.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
Really? Michael went in with him?
Wow.
Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.
Ok. Bye.
Hey, Oscar?
I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.
I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.
Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.
I bought my veil.
Ummm...
Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...
That's a communal bowl.
Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
Ok, it was the second one.
Nuh-uh.
What did you guys talk about?
I hate you.
Hey.
Did you find anything good in your desk?
Score.
Big day.
Oh.
Right.
No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
Mmm, hmm.
Cool.
Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
Oh, no, that's, you don't have to.
No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Yep.
No thanks. You got a package.
Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?
Right.
It was great.
Mm-hm.
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
What?
I don't know.
[looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know.
No, I don't think it's a bird.
Open the door up!
Thanks!
A little.
[giggles at Roy]
You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
[to Roy in Jim's earshot] ...back so soon.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, that's right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
[to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding?
Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.
That doesn't seem fair.
What's our punishment?
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It's Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible.  Anyway, I'm bored.  Come back!
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head.  It's working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
[voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
[voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.
[voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
Jan.
Michael's still at the door.
Mmmhmm.
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
Thanks.
Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...
Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...
Hey.
How's it going down there?
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
No. [laughs]
Almost.
Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
Um...
It's really cool.
Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
How did you know?
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
What? You have something you want to say?
Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!
Yeah.
It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.
You did?
Yeah.
Okay.
How about that one?
I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
[Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.
Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
That's OK.
Guess what?
That's great. [Meredith scowls]
OH, Holy God!
You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Tightly wound?
Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
That you remember her.
Yeah.
[delivering plant to Oscar's desk] Oscar.
[walks away] Join the club.
Hey.
I guess, yeah.
Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me
Heading out?
Bye. [Jim leaves]
Night Phyllis.
Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?
Where is she?
Cool.
I'm gonna spend it with my fiance.
What are you guys doing?
Nice.
Are you sad that Dwight beat you?
Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
Ok, cool.
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
You mean Toastmasters?
Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
That's awesome. Where are you staying?
When are you leaving?
Oh.
Oh yeah. That's too bad.
It's ok. I got it.
Yes, but they are both in danger.
The ones that say 'love' on them?
Oh. Doesn't matter.
As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.
Is that okay?
I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]
Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign]
I reminded you last night.
Don't you think you should say something?
Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.
I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
That is!
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's
Mmhmm.
Sure.
You're welcome.
It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
Really?
Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?
Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
I know.
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]
My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]
I like extra cheese, too.
Yeah. Do you like to draw, Abby?
Me, too.
Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought.
Hmm.
Happy birthday Michael.
I said happy birthday.
One's good.
Michael wants a strippergram?
Michael, I have Jan on the line.
I can sign for it.
When does he hear?
Ohh... poor Kevin.
If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
And his favorite lunch.
You use fabric softener?
No, I do.
[checking watch] We should probably head back.
You dare me? How old are you?
[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I hate you.
No. [laughs]
Who is that?
I got it.
Michael?
This is from all of us.
Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.
He does everyone in the office.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
Jinx! Buy me a coke.
No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]
Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
Sorry, that's not my problem.
Hey guys, what's going on?
Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Uh, hmmm.
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]
[placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam]
Hey.
Ten minutes.
Kevin.
Do someone else.
Angela.
The eyebrow.
Last night? Let's see.
I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?
I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
Has she been on the phone the whole time?
[reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer.
No.
Yeah?
Oh, thanks!
Uh...
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Win!
How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Win.
Win
Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.
Nice.
[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Wait, what did it say?
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
Don't take her side.
I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.
What?!
Okay.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.
That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?
It's a nice tux.
Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
No, they stopped making that show.
No, that's Afghan.
Oh, nothing.
They're wedding bands.
Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
There's a KISS cover band in here.
I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Have three stages, yeah.
Oh.
Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.
On the drums! On the drums!
Oh, my...
No! No!
No, come back! No, no, no!
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
[phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.
Carol Stills.
Your realtor.
It's still me.
Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
Carol, you're on with Michael.
Michael, Jan's on line two.
It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael.
[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
Yeah, right,' what?
[Laughs] I have good cards.
Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.
Straight.
It's okay. I'll see you at home.
Okay.
Bye! Hey.
Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
About when you want to give me more of your money?
Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
What?
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Well, I um... I... I can't.
You have no idea...
...what your friendship means to me.
I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]
Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.
It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head.
Me too.  ...I think we're just drunk.
No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---
[loud sigh] Chicken.
Excellent, thanks.
Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can't really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I'm, I'm doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I'm taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.
Yup.
I'm... painting my new apartment tonight.
Yes.
Thanks.
Right.
What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody's personal business!
Yeah?
No, I didn't.
What was Oprah about?
That's a really big decision.
Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
Or not adopt.
Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
Yeah.
You probably won't.
No, Michael.
No, Michael.
Sure.
This.
Thank you.
Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.
I'll probably just wear this.
Um...
Mm-hmm.
Hey! What's up?
[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up?
Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.
So how do you come up with your cartoons?
You dream in cartoons? How fun!
Huh.
Freedom fries. Yeah.
Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
More freedom fries.
That's great.
I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.
[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?
[with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo.
Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.
[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]
Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.
Really?  I don't know.
Not at work, I'll try it on---
...noooo
[smiling] It's too much.
I'm gonna return it.
Hi.
Thanks.
I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken.  If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.
What?
Please go back to your desk.
Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I'm gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you. [to Michael] It's Jan for you.
Yeah.
I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious.
Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?
The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
Is there anything I can do?
Yeah.
Oh.  Okay.
[extricating herself] Okay.
Oh.  I would like a break.
Great.
I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
You waited for me?
Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
Is it for the bird?
I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box]
If you wanna do something for the funeral...
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
Do you have it with you?
Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.
Actually, I have it.
I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.
[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
Hi.
Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.
Closer to the epicenter, I guess.
Really?
Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.
Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'
I should probably head back in.
But, umm, thanks for the break.
Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.'
Hi.
Oh, I don't know if I'm...
It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
Michael.
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.
Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
Night.
20 past 5.
PM.
These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
This is a huge sale.
Night, Michael.
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin.
Oh my God.
Hi.
Oh.
I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
Yeah, totally. So...
Do you...
Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.
A little different. What time is it there?
Oh, yeah. Right.
I don't know. It felt far.
What?
I type 90.
It's true.
70? How many do you type?
Come on. Tell me.
You have to tell me now.
No, it's, that's respectable.
So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself...
Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
And, I'm freaking out.
That movie is so scary!
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
Would I make that up?
Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
I have one kitchen.
It's actually...
Three kitchens?
[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
Um. Ok, bye.
No, I was um...
You have to go?
No, I should probably go too.
I mean, yeah.
Bye Jim.
It's like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.
Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal.
Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
Yeah.
Really you do. I love the material.
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I just feel kind of tired, you know.
Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
Very official.
I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
It's hot in there. How's the naan?
I am. You should come dance with us.
No one.
Here. [hands drink]
Yeah.
Uh... no.
Well, you were never really engaged.
Yeah.
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
What are you doing?
I'm rejecting your...
...kiss.
If you sit in the back.
You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
[on phone] Michael, you're on with Jan.
Michael?
Your shirt is buttoned wrong.
Are you okay?
What did Jan want?
What can't you tell me?
What?!
You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
Michael, what's going on?
It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.
Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.
He's not here. I don't know where he is.
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.
Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
No thanks, guys.
Have fun though.
Really? Where did you hear that?
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
Hey!
How'd the run go?
That's great!
Because he accomplished something.
Really, Dwight? How fast are you?
Really?
Oh, I'll just time him later.
Yeah. Are you ready?
Set
Go!
Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
I should probably get back to work.
Good morning!
Okay.
Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
Hi!
I'm Pam.
Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
Oh my god! It's really you!
I know. I don't care.
It's really good to see you.
You won't be disappointed.
Hey.
What happened to grape soda?
Oh. You've changed so much.
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
Yeah. I know, me too.
The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
Hey!
Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
What's up?
What do you mean?
Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
We're friends. We'll always be friends.
It's good to have you back.
This is weird with you facing the other way.
That's Stanley Hudson.
He's one of our salesmen.
Oh very.
Hmm, that is... Janet Fenstermaker.
[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.
Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.
For both sides. Whoever paid more.
Yeah.
Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!
...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink.
...Oh. That's... fun for him.
[whispering] Who is it?
Why would anyone go to jail for that?
Okay. Angela?
My dad.
What was prison like?
Yeah, some days I never go outside.
They have art classes?
Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
Wow... I--
Wow. That was... wow.
Michael, it's freezing out.
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
Dwight, what uh...
Well, get it out of here.
I would like it off my desk.
Can I help you, Michael?
It's behind you.
Michael?
[hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate.
Yup.
Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.
For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]
They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.
So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it.
Oh.
Oh yeah.
No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]
Michael, what's going on?
I know.
OK, well, why are you laying like that?
Like what?
Well.. um I, I don't...
I don't need to know.
No, thank you.
I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.
Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
Um, usually like that.
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]
Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.
That could really be fun.
You guys do a raffle?
There is now. We just started it.
What's ours again?
Oh right.
Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]
You can't do that.
That's a great idea.
You can have your snack in here.
If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.
Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
Oh yeah, your mom would love that.
Bye.
Oh, yeah... Maybe.
Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]
Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.]
We have vodka!
I got goose bumps.
What?
Can I talk to you a second?
[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.
Mmm. Hmm.
We'll go tell everyone.
Night.
We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.
It costs seventy five dollars.
Ohh... [laughs]
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
OK.
It's kind of serious.
How was Jamaica?
That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell]
Huh.
It's kind of an impoverished country.
But you can't today, we're doing inventory.
We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.
Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]
On the left.
Hey.
You OK?
You sure?
Oh. You want to talk about it?
Hmm.
How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.
He'll call you back. OK, great.
Hey.
What are you doing out here?
Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
That's all she said.
Sorry?
Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
Sure.
What? No, it's not... it's nothing.
Yeah.
[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
Yeah.
Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.
That's okay.
No.
No.
Thank you.
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.
Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park?
Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...
I think that's mold.
Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05.
Great.
Who is 'Long Tim'?
I would love to meet Long Tim.
Yeah.
Ok. Bye Harvey.
Really?
Ok. Sure.
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
That's great.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
$100.00
Cool. Congratulations.
Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
Oh.
Oh?
Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
No, thanks. I had some already.
Oh, but, hey, Jim.
I won an art contest today.
Thanks.
I sent in one of my watercolors.
It was the new one I did.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
Nope.
[takes the phone] Hmm.
Angela?
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]
No, I will not.
What?
No.  No. [Leaves]
Something's up with Jim and Karen.  Not that I've been eavesdropping.  It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck.
Hey.
Ugh.
Everything okay?
Well you seem a little tired.
You should get more sleep.
Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.
When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
Yeah.  Don't fall asleep at your desk.  [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.
I think that's champagne.
But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?
Okay Ben Franklin!
Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
What do you mean?
Oh yeah.
Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you're going out with Jim.  I'm not going out with Jim.  You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
I'm not into Jim.  Yeah.
Yeah.  Sorry.
Um, what?
Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.
I know.
Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?
Ohhh.
Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.
Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
Thanks.
Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.
Also, Pam and Roy.
That's my dress.
What do you mean?
Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine
Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks
Hey.
You're kidding me, right?
Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Hey!
Oh... I'm pacing myself.
No. I'm such a dorky dancer.
Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.
Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
Thanks.
I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
You too.
Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
Dwight, what are you doing?
Oh! No, you should go.
...And it's all from the same series.
Called 'Impressions.'
Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
I hope so.
I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?
Hey, Kenny.
Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home.
Maybe, I'm a little tired.
Thank you.
Oh, Michael.
Yep.
What do you mean?
Um... you wanna buy it?
Uh-huh.
[hugs Michael] ... Thank you.
Do you have something in your pocket?
No thank you.
[looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Yeah that seems fair.
So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
No, no.
Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
Oh, that duck is so cute.
Hey guys.
Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
Hey. You made it.
Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.
[looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
Nice job.
Oh yeah?
Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
Hey, don't you have a daughter?
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.
Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
Just listen.
Don't yell!
This is over.
[laughs]
Yes boss.
ROY!
Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy]
I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It
Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!
Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.
[Laughing, covering her mouth]
It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
Sorry I almost got you killed.
He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It's just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
Not anymore.  It's, um... It's completely over now.
Jim... I am really... sorry.
I don't know.
I'm sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
Um... no.  No, he has a girlfriend.
No, there were a lot of reasons.
I know.
Oh, welcome back, Andy.
Oh.  Drew.  Sorry.
It's called being smart.
I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.
Ten...
47, 48, 49! Jim wins!
I don't understand the question.
Yeah...
It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
So, you're okay?
Hey Creed.
Hey.
Yes!
What are the odds that this is in any way real?
Oh... God.  Oh my God, he's gonna jump.
Yeah...
Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Come down and... open it and you'll see.
Dwight, what are you---
I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.
Hey!
[on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
We're having a press conference?
Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call.  I'm so sorry.  Bye.
It's just the Scranton Times...
You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Yes.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch.
Cut.
Cut.
One day for what?
OK.
Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
[door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
What? Really?
Oh, my God.
[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
[whispering] It's just, like, so creepy.
Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
It's disgusting and demeaning.
Phallus?
I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
[reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
Yeah.
Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
[tires screeching] Oh.
Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.
What do you want to dish about?
OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
Oh, my God.
Michael, you need to get out of this.
No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]
Read the pros first.
What was the last one?
Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
No one said it has no calories.
I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
Don't answer it.
Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
I think I've got it.
I don't think we really need that, Michael.
You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
Good luck, Michael.
Don't leave a -
It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
Michael?
David Wallace is on line one.
Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
Thanks Toby.
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
Like what?
Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?
There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
When's the contest?
How am I supposed to... get...
I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
I really doubt it, Michael.
I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
I'd like to try it.
But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Do you want us to count to three?
Michael, do something!
[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.
Jim, David Wallace is calling for you.
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
I think they were just having fun.
It tells me nothing.
There's 800 of them!
Hey. I think it looks great.
After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
Hey.
Um, about the beach...
Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
Wow, very funny.
[smiles]
He's from that company in Pitts...
What do you want me to do?
What about Meredith?
So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
Uh, sure.
I really hope you get the job.
Just don't get back together with her.
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Right.
Oh my God. [mouths to Jim]
[whispers] That's crazy!
[mouths] Wow!
No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
[to Jim] Good luck.
I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
What happened?
Thank you.
Really?
You will be your own assistant.
Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
Mm-hmm.
Absolutely, I do.
I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'
Then who do you think will get the job?
[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
How'd it go?
Did... Karen get the job?
Dwight, hello.
No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
Medium rare.  Thanks. [they laugh]
I know.
Well, I wish you would.
[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]
Yes.
[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
Mmm-hmm. [nods]
Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.
Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.
Okay.
Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
It was for a video.
A celebrity sex tape.
Not relevant.
Not relevant.
It all happened so fast.
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
Cool.
Well have fun with that.
Thank God you were there.
Oh, Michael.
Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.
I was planning on it.
Angela?
[to Angela] Are you coming?
Can't your other cats keep her company.
Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.
OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
I can take 3 people.
Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
I...
I was thinking that we...
But...
Michael! Michael!
[to Angela] It's gonna be OK.
Michael, Angela's cat died.
That's cool.
Oh me too.
[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
I can help you with that.
[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
What's wrong?
Hmm...
Ah.
Angela, I'm sorry.
I'm more of a dog person.
Well I'm gonna start fast.
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
Then I'm gonna end fast.
Cause they're just stupid.
Yeah... That was um...
Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
... We're dating.
Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?
Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
Giant check it is.
Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
I don't think so.
Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
Hey.
Oh my God.
You said come in!
Oh my God.
So I closed the door but the image of his...
... dangling participle...
... still burned in my eyes.
[Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.
Yes. Or come in.
On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
They're so not.
I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
What? Look, no it was not...
Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place.
Darn it.
I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
Mmm... Yes.
Yeah.
[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?
I'm still having a nice day.
Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
Michael.
Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]
Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?
Hey.
I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim]
Yeah.
No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?
Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk]
[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
You might want to trim it a little.
Yeah, he is.
Hey Toby.
Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]
OK.
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Yeah.
No.. [in awe]
No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
You didn't say anything to me?
Can you believe that...
OK.
Hi.
In his office. You can go right in.
Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
Oh. [man enters conference room]
I think that I should help him get home.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
Hey.
It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...
I now find you repulsive.
Eh...
OK.
Uh totally.
Yeah.
Thank you.
OK.
Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
Thanks.
That'd be great.
Oh... is it...
No...
Um...
I'm uh, I'm dating Jim.
We're together.
Yeah, great.
OK great!
Great.
I got it.
Hey, Michael.
Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her.
Sure.
Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry.  So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.
Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines?
I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
He does.
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.  It's very complicated.  It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
He's going through a break-up.
What kind of prank are you thinking?
Yes it's too tight.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Uh, just one second.  We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available.  It's Jan.
One of the tickets is for him.
I won.
Tie goes to the girlfriend.
Here's a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
Hello.
Um... uh... I'll get back to you.
The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
I said it normal.
Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
I'm all over it.
Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.
Yep.
Nope.
Ah-ha.
Excuse me?
Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.
[interrupting] The city mirrors, or the...?
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?
Put cold tea bags on your eyes.
Yeah.
Mmhmm.
Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
A suit?
Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
You finished the movie.
No. Go ahead.
Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
[on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.
Hello, I'm looking for a room.
It says here you cater to the eldery.
Trip Advsior.
Two?
Shoot!
We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.
The Beets Motel.
Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]
Oh my gosh.
What are the themes?
Irrigation.
What?
Yeah. Coward.
[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.
Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?
It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
How did he use it again?
What's up?
You're being gross.
What moves?
I can't believe that's not working.
Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.
She's very religious.
Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
That's right, you did.
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
Michael.
What's going on, why do you have a second job?
Doesn't Jan have money?
Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.
We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
Table making never seemed so possible.
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
We really did.  It was fun.
Dwight.
Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]
Okay.
Yeah.
Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
Mmm.  Mmm-mmm. [shakes head 'no']
[Mose serves bacon] Thank you, Mose.
Where'd he go?
Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she?
Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?
Okay, we're watching, Mose!
I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
No talk, I'm animating.
Are you serious?
Oh my God, he's really in pain.
Who's that?
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
Oh boy.
Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
No no, you can go home. I'm good.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Thank you.
I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
[on phone] Yes?
Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.
Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]
How about Darryl?
Oscar, did you bring it?
Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Some people.
I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
[giggles]
It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.
And spend time with George Emerson.  That's what I would do.  I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?
Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucy's torn between these two things.  She's torn between passion and convention.
It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine]  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
Very brave choice also, I thought.
Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.
[nods head yes]
[mouths 'I'm sorry' to Oscar]
Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.
[on phone] So, there was no sales call.
Wait, you're going along with this now?
Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.
A little bit.
Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much?
Okay.  Have fun with your girlfriend!
I'm kidding around.  We joke about that stuff all the time.  I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen.  I care a little.
Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
Did you sleep in cabins?
Who went?
Do you want me to ask where you're going?
Great.
Oh.
Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?
Do you think it's a good idea?
[smiles] Hmm.
Wow! That was easy.
[raises hand] Conference room?
Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?
Oh, no.
Yes, I have been working with you forever.
I don't think so.
Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.
I do.
No.
You're welcome.  Open or closed?
No.
Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.
Couple minutes, give or take.
Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
Hi, Kelly.
I don't wanna guess.
Jim. Can I see you for a second?
Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
Sorta, yes.
Okay.
Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.
He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
[walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?
Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
I'll make the call.
[watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that?
You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!
Let's go. Pick up a paddle.
I am.
In my sleep.
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] [serves] P.
What are you doing?
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand]  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice.  Okay?  I'm not kidding!
Now.  Get good work done.  Concentrate.
On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters]
We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
It's really nice.
Uh-huh.
So you have an office and a workspace?
What a cute bench.
Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
Montana.
Joe Montana!
Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?
Oh okay.
Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.
Is there more wine in the kitchen?
No, yeah. What?
Oh, are you joking?
I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
[whispering] Awesome.
[whispers] Like... like what?
I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
And now you guys are dating?
[whispers] Flooded.
[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.
Hmm?
[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...
[to Jim, quietly] Food!
[quietly] Not with your hands.
Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]
Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.
It was just a little...
Where did you grow up?
Wow, you did neighborhood watch?
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
Nature.
Some of us like the walk more than others.
[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.
Her?
The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
Or in a great chair.
I definitely remember your dinner party.
Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.
[to Jim] Who are you putting down?
Who is it?
Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.
OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]
I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
I know.
Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.
Hmm, I don't, know...
Oh, right now?
OK, so then, when?
Oh, right, yeah.
Ohh kay.
I've been warned.
Nice job.
I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...
[smiling] I hate you. [walks away]
Oh, oh.
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
I don't have anybody.
No...
Sorry.
No, I don't, I...
I just...
Are you talking about Beverley?
Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator.
What's wrong Michael?
You do.
We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, 'What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?' He said, 'If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.'
I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
Aw! That's great Toby.
Toby, you're the best.
Phyllis.
I know how to throw a football.
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.
I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]
That's the other Boleyn girl.
Shh.
Mmm?
I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job.
Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
I don't have my contacts...
Don't, don't--
If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, okay...
I should probably get back to...
Entering the....
No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]
Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?
Because you're very important?
What does that mean?
I can't find my glasses.
Okay, okay.
What kind of stuff does Stanley say?
Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.
Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.
Thanks, Phyllis.  Yours, too.
Really?
Huh.  Maybe I will.
What's it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I'll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I'm 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this.  I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great.
Hi, can I help you?
[pointing] Ryan!
Yeah.
Okay.
I've heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor]
Okay.
Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.
[to Darryl] I think you look nice.
So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
[holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought.
There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
[laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.
He's nice and he seems interested.
I only brought the one.
Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?
Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves]
My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
A piece of paper.
Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Are you serious?
Okay.
Just checking in, how's it going?
I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
Talk to you later?
Excuse me.
[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?
Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]
Well done.
Hi.
I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
I can do that.
I don't know any of those.
New York or Philadelphia.
All right. Cool, well... thanks.
And uh, I'll look into those.
New York or Philadelphia.
Okay.
Thanks.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hey, is this Dwight?
Oh my goodness, you sound sexy.
Have you?
Dwight?
I'm confused...
Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?
So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Hi, can I help you?
Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek]
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!
I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw 'congratulations' and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...
Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.
Ohh... [they hug; she laughs]
I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word 'perfect' in here!
Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
Well I was taking the picture.
Sure, do you have a camera here?
Okay...
[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?
Okay.
Toby, why don't you open your present?
Michael...
So what is your gift?
What is it?
Your watch?
I just knew.
Is that the police?
Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver]
Wow. Look at our parking lot.
Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
[everyone applauds] Yay, Phyllis!
Song parody writer.
I like that one.
I like that one.
I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]
Oh, yeah, um...
Sure. Meredith, do you mind?
I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
[to Toby] Thank you!
Hey.
Did you just buy that?
Ahh!  I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't see you come in.
Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second.
Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
Just, we'll just keep going.
Yes.
Yes.
I have everything.
Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?
I should really get going.
I'm sure it was really lovely.
OK, bye.
No, Michael.
I'm in the wrong class...
Oh, no. I just--
[on computer screen] I can see you!
This is so cool.
Lunch with a girl from my hall.
Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
The nerve.
They're on the supply shelf.
New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]
What?
Really, where?
Wow, was it the age difference?
Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
[to friend] Nice.
Sorry.
You've already disappointed him so much.  He can't be expecting a lot from you.
I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?
No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.
OK.
Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
What are you doing?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Yes! [they embrace and kiss]
[on the phone] Well, I should go.
No, don't.  I'm mad at them.
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
What?  Why not?
Come on, it won't be that bad.
[speakerphone] Hi everyone!
Wow.
No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. [Michael waves 'hi' at the phone]
Sorry.
[on phone] So you know Stacy, right?
There's no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.
Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in.
No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way.  You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
Yes!
No, it's horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can't you just be in art class with me?
Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]
Hey you!
Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-
I can't hear anything!
OK.
I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync.  You know, that's all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
Hi.
[on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...
I'll leave a message.
I guess this is just one of those days.  It'll get better.
I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don't worry, I'm being safe.  And I'm headed home.  I'm... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
Anyway, um... I miss you.
Okay, thanks.
New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
Hey.
Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
Hey Michael.
What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy.
It is.  Thanks again.
[long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you...
If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even?
I know.  And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing?  How can Josh and Sam keep quiet?
Every night, Jim and I watch an episode of The West Wing together on DVD.  Um, he wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica and I wanted to watch Cranford... so we compromised.  Next we're gonna watch Cranford.
Hey.
Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]
So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.
Hey!
How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
Okay, okay.
Oookay....
They came up with that idea really fast.
Hey guys.
Hi! [smooches]
Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]
Cute.
Miles Davis.
Chet ...something.
Dizzy Gillespie.
I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...
... Got you.
For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.
Thank you.
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
[on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.
It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.
I should go.
[listening in New York] I miss him.
Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.
[Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
[whispers on bluetooth] Good luck.
I love you.
[touches ear] Jim? Jim?
Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
[on Bluetooth] Ooh, cute shoes online.
[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of 'Centerfold'] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
[in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
[on Bluetooth] That was weird.
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
Did you do something to her?
Well, something's off.
Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
[in New York] Right Dwight is loud.
Hey, what are you doing here?
It's Alex.
Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
OK.
What's up?
Wow.
Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
Jim's in Scranton.
I'll see you tomorrow.
[in Jim's ear] Ask how he's doing since the breakup.
Ask if there's anything you can do.
Tell him you'd like to go with him.
[in Jim's ear] I wonder what else Dwight's been right about....
[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs]
[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
I have to stay and retake it.
That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?
[over phone] I know.
[starting to cry] Right.
[over phone] Yeah I'm fine.  Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go.
Alright.
[over phone] Love you. Bye.
I'm coming back the wrong way.  [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you.  I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it.  It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?
I missed you too. [Jim kisses her]
Uh, yeah.
I'm not going inside.
[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.
Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.
When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.
[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
Are you inching away from me?
Reach your arms out.
What do you need, Michael?
Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'
Thank you.
I know, can you believe it?
I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?
How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
You've seen things cleaned before though, right?
I don't know anything about that.
Here?
Sure.
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?
I don't get it.
I love it.
Yeah, I love it!
I mean, you bought me a house!
You bought me a house!
Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?
And the clown?
New chairs?
Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...
Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
Michael?
I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
What? Jim.
Hey.
So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
I really think you should reconsider.
Yeah, I know.
But I really think you should reconsider.
Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.
Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
Well that never happened.
So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.
Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
Aww.
That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]
Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door]
Michael?
Hey!
You got a second?
Oh, good.
Oh, that must've been so fun.
Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
Yeah, is that a new tie?
That is amazing!
What?
No.
[applauding] No way!
Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
Yeah.
Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...
But not everyone...
Or even uses the copier every day.
Yeah, right?
...That's it. [giggles]
All right, see you later...
Hot tie guy.
No, copier's great.
Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]
And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]
So suck it.
There's that ass!
Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!
Did somebody call Hank?
You can try mine.
Yeah, know what?
You can do that?
You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
Or chairs?
So what's it gonna be?
Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
Hey.
Thanks Michael.
Yeah, I guess, since I won.
I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]
I knew it.
I knew some of it.
It's Christmas.
Thank you. I knew it.
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
Quick announcement: new year, new candy.
Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
Yeah.
So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
Of course you will.
Oh my God!
Have you seen her with her bangs?
[disapprovingly] Kevin!
Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.
No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]
Hillary swank.
[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
The phones are dead.
Try a different door.
What do we do?
We don't normally download films illegally.  Because we're honest,  hardworking people.
But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
He's not saying what he needs to say.
Yeah.
Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
Hey.
Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
[sighs]
I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.
You're good to talk to.
What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
What did you say to my dad?
After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
I think he meant personal day.
Phyllis there's a package for you.
Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.
Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
Yeah. [they hug]
When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]
Michael! It's really good to see you.
What?
Ugh.
Good morning.
He brought a sled.
Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Separate rooms.
I'm going to say it anyway.
This is a new cardigan.
No.
Can I turn on the radio?
But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
That's dangerous.
That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
No, that was a long time ago.
No, I'm not even wearing that much.
I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
Stop it, please.
Please cut it out.
Michael!
No it's not.
So when are you due?
Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.
Oh, he's cute.
What is happening there? [points at picture]
It's really sweet.
Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.
Thank you.
I like her.
I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.
Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.
Are you asleep?
No, remind me.
Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly.
Okay, lets go.
Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this.
We're engaged.
Oh, wow, thank you!
... Okay, let's go.
So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long.
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
You look good.
I'm so sorry, Michael.
She's not doing it to hurt you.
Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe. One step at a time.
You can do this.
Oh, God.
Michael, get off the floor!
[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-
That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.
[pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.
[loading up car with Michael] Don't look up. Don't look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window]
No.
What?
Oh, Michael...
You did what?
She never sent it to you?
No.
No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.
Because, she didn't send it to you!
I could read it.
Yeah, I could read it.
Go get your laptop.
[to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.
[closes laptop] It's deleted.
She still has feelings for you.
I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.
[nods and smiles]
No, we don't need to do that.
You mean Tony?
Oh, Michael.
Good morning, can I help you?
I'm sorry, he's not in right now.
Shoot.
They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.
That is a great idea.
[while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
There he is!
Ayyyy!
That was funny.
This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
Really, Jim?  On Cupid's birthday?
I can't see them when they're on the floor
You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
What do you think?
We're in.
Anything to get out of that office.
Wow,  that's impressive.
What?
Jim uses a 6 pound ball.
Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
No, you just have little dainty fingers.
What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.
Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
[looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?
Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
Do you think they dined and dashed?
I thought we were having a nice time.
Yeah.
[exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate]
My God.
Yep, that, yeah.
[on the phone] Yeah, that's no problem.
[on the phone] Sure. Uh huh.
I'm on the phone.
[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
[sighs] Who's there?
Buddha who?
Great.
Now there's, there's butter on my desk.
[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.
Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Jelly beans.
You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings]
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.
[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
Sure.
It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
OK.
Not classy.
Hi, can I help you?
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
Yeah, are you coming out now?
This is what you did last night?
He just had to wear his tux today.
Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
[to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-
Oh no.
I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
It's really just a regular shaped cake.
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
Do you have any leads on a job?
Hi.
Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes.
Hmm?
I'm working on it Kev.
It'll be ready soon.
Is that what 'soon' means to you?
Then come back soon.
During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'
Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
That's a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
Hmm...
Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
Yeah. Good.
Mmm-hmm
Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
Meredith...  [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44.  It's not ready Kevin!
I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
How's it working?
Good.
I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels...
[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?
Oh no.
I'm going with him.
I'm going.
Michael, wait!  I'm coming with you.
Yeah.
Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
Salesman.
Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
Probably.
Okay, see you later.
Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
Michael, you were expecting me, right?
Are you wearing anything under the robe?
This looks great, Michael.
Yes, please.
... Square is fine.
So, what do you say we get started?
I'm full.
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
No, I know you are.
Just let me have... Oh.
Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
I think you should get dressed.
Michael, that seems impossible.
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Great.
No. What? Why?
No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
Okay.
We'll find him.
Really?
We have an investor already?
Michael, that's fantastic.
Hey! We need to get you dressed!
I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
Next on the list - open the mail.
No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
Next on the list --  song parodies.
Great. Let's sing it in the car.
Yeah.
We can do this.
[Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!
We have a meeting with an investor today.
He can be.
Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
Yes. Yes, it's possible.
Michael! What's going on?
Hey, Ryan.
This wasn't on the list.
No.
It's not.
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
No.
What is he doing?
Oh my God.
Sorry!
Sure.
Beat.
[mouthing to camera] Nana?
It means grandmother.
I can't do this.
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
Yeah.
I could work here. I could see this.
Are you good?
I'm good.
Morning Michael!
What should we do now?
I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
That is so insulting.
Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Shut up!
Really!
Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
Oh yeah I bet.
Michael, we can hear you.
Okay it's my turn.
Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
You're gonna make another 'spreadsheet.'
Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
Come on! Ryan!
Definitely.
We could work from home.
.... Corner idea?
How would we know that?
I thought that was your corner.
So my corner's the one with the copier?
No thanks.
Hey I'm here to see Charles.
Hey Charles.
I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
Personal shopper?
Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Hey.
Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
That's as specific as I'd like to be.
We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
We already offered free delivery!
Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
A guarantee of what?
And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
I made a sale!
Oh!
Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
We're getting pretty good at it.
The timeline's messy.
I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
Mm-hmm.
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
Michael, are you alright?
Tell us what you're talking about.
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
Michael!
I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
[Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.
Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
When are you ever responsible for your actions?
It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?
I don't think so, Andy.
We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
Do you drink this every day?
[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Yeah, I know what a loft is.
Corporate greed?
Did it help?
When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.'
We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
That's what Michael said.
I like it.
Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.
You want to hear something sad?
So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
Really?
Seriously?  Are you being serious?
Yes.
Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
No, Michael.
We have to come from a position of strength.
Mm-hmm.
$60,000.00
Are you kidding me?
Can you give us another minute please?
Michael.
Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer.
Agreed.  But that's all, okay.
Thank you.
That's right.
Alright!
[whispering] Who is it?
[laughs]  Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?
Well, you have good taste.
What?
Oh, I, um...
Thank, Michael.
That one's great.
What?
Mm-hmmm.
We were something else.
Mmm.
You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
Yeah.
Just tell me.
No, okay.
Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
I did?
For real, you're not kidding?
I did?
Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.
Thank you.  You will not be sorry.
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
Yeah.  'Cause you said I didn't
What about Ryan?
Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
Thanks, Michael.
Erin.
[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing]
Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Just sent it.
If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
We're getting married today.
Tell 'em how it happened.
And very expensive.
You can't leave anyone out.
Ok, just get to the good part.
I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
What?
They're beautiful.
Yeah.
This is so cheesy.
I like cheesy.
Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.
Really?
[whispering] I can do it.
You had to be there.
Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
Okay.
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
Tell them what happened last year.
No, no, that guy who hit on me.
Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
Hey Charles.
Do you want me to beat him up for you?
Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?
Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
Good game!
How do you figure?
Let's do this.
[running for the ball] I got it!
[falls] Oof!
Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine.
Yeah.
No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
We'll be back!
How long will that take?
I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. [interns are shown gathered around Kelly's desk, one holding a box of tissues, as Kelly cries and wipes tears] He didn't do anything sexual. [female intern opens a jar of salsa for Michael] He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. [Meredith rubs her breasts into Maurie's back] It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
Nobody.
[talking head with Jim] We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
Nope.
Can't back out now, Halpert.
No, keep it up.
Just keep it to yourself then.
What?
Why did that come into your brain?
Who did you tell?
Nobody!
Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!
[to Michael] Where are you going?
Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator]
Don't... get... on. Do not.
Step away.
Jim.
Stop. Don't. Just...
Yes.
Okay. [leaves room]
[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]
[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
[in disbelief] You called Stanley's wife?
If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
Michael, please don't.
Hey, Good luck.
Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
Ummm, I don't know.
Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.
Please don't talk about my breast milk.
Yeah.
Hey Kelly.
Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet.
We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  [whispers] Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
Hey Ryan.
So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.
It costs about $75 per person.
Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.
Kelly Kapoor, yes.
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...
You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
To ask for directions..
And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
So rude, right?
[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.
I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.
We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.
It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
Oh, good.
No, we're not.
I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!
Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
Jim?
Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.
$100 now for sure.
Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.
How sure is this?
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.
You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.
Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.
Thank you, Dwight.
See you later. [others say good-bye]
[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
Yeah.
Oh.
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
Can we take a look at the suite now?
Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
Hey, Mema.
Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.
Oscar, it was an honest mistake.
She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.
Like... a year.
Michael.
Michael. Stop.
Mema.
Hey, smooth guys.
Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
[sighs] Nevermind.
Yeah.
No.
What?
Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
[on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
He tore his scrotum dancing.
He is in my room icing his balls.
Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
Your brothers took you out drinking?
That's Michael.  You're out with Michael?
Okay, fine.  I'll take him.
Are you pushing me off the phone?
Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.
My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That's my job.
Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
Thank you weirdo.
Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]
Thanks mom.
He does.
Yes. Thank you, mom.
Okay great.  [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!
Can you come here please?
No.  No, but I'm allowing it.  Just come here.
Hey.
Terrible.
My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
[sighs] Thank you.
No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie]
[sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?
You look great.
Mm-hmm.
Yes I did.
[smiles] Go ahead.  I think it's your turn.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Saw it.
Hey Oscar.  It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
[on phone] Are you kidding me?
Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
It really was.
Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
[goofy voice] Frank and beans!
Hi, Michael.
Some candy.
That's it.
It's good to be home.
Hey!
Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
[laughs] I think it'll be okay.
Great.
Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?
Come on, it'll take two seconds.
[giggles]
Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.
[laughs] I don't know. I think Michael has a date.
[laughs] I think you have a date.
Come on.
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
Of course.
Oh.
Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?
No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]
[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
Thank you.
You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
Haha!  Ha ha ha.
I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]
I love it, conservation.  Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]
I'm not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
Don't call my mother your lover.
Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom...
Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
You are never going to be my father, you get out!
Me too...
Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign]
Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
Sure, what's up?
[to Michael] What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?
[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?
You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
Michael, you're just her rebound!
[to Jim] What!  You knew?
Mmmmm, yes!
Then why'd you even offer!?
Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
What's that supposed to mean?
Shut it!
[looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?
Mmmm.
Haha, yeah.  Say more nice things.
Maybe I'm overreacting.
But I don't think I am.
Here we are outside-
- the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park.
The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401.
I know. Now you don't have to.
[Andy shakes his head 'no'] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
It's ok.
Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
Yeah.
You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
You blew the sale, you idiot.
Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.
Well, you know.
He loves to eat.
I love to watch him dance.
And I'll just watch him.
Yes.
Mmm-hmm.
It was, sweetie.
Yeah, well, that'll happen.
Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
Yeah, I guess.
If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.
Yeah. Way too much.
I mean, what the hell was that?
When you cried?
You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
Hmm.
Well, are you dating anyone?
Ah.
Ah.
Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
Ok.
Mmm-hmm.
No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.
Yeah, he is.
That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando.
I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
Oh, no thank you.
I have an early lunch.
Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
Kevin!
Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]
Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don't think I can go to lunch.
I know.  Isn't that always how it goes?
I want to handle it.
I feel like its--
Yeah-- it's exciting.
Thank you.
Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
Michael, you did all this?
So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
49 again? That's nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
Please be Grandma.
I want you to be Grandma.
Yay, Grandma!
Maybe.
What about your gift Michael?
He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
Aww--
That's amazing.
Yeah.
That's really nice Michael.
Home run Michael.
Hey. Where'd you go?
And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It's time for cake.
Cakes really good.
Michael.  Michael ,it's okay.
I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
Well--
Michael.
What?
I am working.
Really?
Really?
Why?
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
I have the worst attitude of any person here.
Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]
You're bribing me?
I want to hit you.
I want to hit you.  I'll do that.
No.  Are you kidding?
No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.
So, um... we'll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
Okay.
See you then.
Oh...
Right.
Okay.
[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
Okay. [punches Toby's hand]
Wow!
Are you ready?
[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
Michael, you have to put your hands down.
What are you sorry for?
How about for dating my mom?
And dumping her on her birthday.
Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
Are you okay?
You're okay.
No.  You were right.
Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
Who are you?
I'll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.
Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
I do not.
I think Michael may have snapped.
Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?
Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?
[Jim comes out of the office]  What's the news?
[accent] It wasn't me.  I'm not goin' down for this!
Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]
Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.
A world where you truly can be anything you want.
That's great.
Sure.
Don't do the twirl.
Stuff gets around. I don't participate.
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
Can you actually fire people?
Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.
Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.
Well, you'll figure it out.
[glances at it] Looks great.
Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
Michael, why did you promise that?
No Michael, why would you promise that?
Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.
It's terrible.
Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.
No!
You have to tell them.
It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.
Thank you.
No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
Yup.
Ah!
Is it, is it fake?
So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot]  I think my water just broke!
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.
Have you talked to him?
Matt?
Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
Okay.
Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
How could we do what? [general murmur]
Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals]
Hello.
Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.
For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
Good to meet you.
Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
[Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.
Yep.
Yes.
Oh, Michael.
No, don't!
What do you want us to do?
Because we're usually not on the same page.
Hey.
Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.
We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
We're hoping our interview seals the deal.
Okay. Okay. Yeah.
There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
What?
Who? The -
The guy we're meeting with?
Hi Jerry.
It's lovely.
Ok, you've got to pull it together.
He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.
Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!
Michael, stop.
Michael...
[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.
[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
Kevin, you're such a gourmand.
Hmm.
Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
No, no.  I still have time.
I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
Ooh.
You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
Everything's fine.  We have plenty of time.
Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.
No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.
Five minutes apart.
Okay, stop watching me.
Mm-hmm.
Not until midnight.
Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
Oh, thanks, Kelly.
Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.
Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.
Why don't you go do some work?
I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
Okay.
Hey.  I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
Okay, Jim.
Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?
I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn't wait...  Oh, God, don't be mad.
Mm-hmm.
I know.
Good.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, my water broke.
[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
No, not yet, Michael.
Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?
There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
Nope.  No, no, that's better.  That wasn't even the worst of them.  I'm fine.
They're not that bad still, babe.
No, it's passing, it's fine.  It's okay.
No, it's passing, it's fine.
Ah, no, it passed.  It's good.
Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
Oh, God.  Oh, no.
Jim, we waited too long!
I don't want to have my baby here.
The hospital.
A baby.
Dwight, get away!
Michael!
Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
Wait, wait.  My iPod's not in here!
It has the birth song on it!
Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it's on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...
Dwight just listen!  It's underneath...  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]
Yes.
No, Jim, stay!
Okay.
This is happening!
Oh, my God.
[with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
Okay.
Oh, thank God.  I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
Okay.
Love you, mom.
Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
Again, no pants.
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
Good.
Doesn't she sleep here?
[as the baby yawns]  Oh, big yawn.
One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.
She's not gonna...  Just...
Go.
I don't know.  I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
Doesn't feel right.
How does one do that?
Do you want to try it, Jim?
I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.
Even if she's not getting anything?
No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
I know.
Yes?
Um, yeah, that would be great.
So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.
Okay.
Okay.
No, I mean, it feels...  pressure.
No.  It just feels like pressure.
Okay.  So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though.  I'm not sure if...
Okay.  Aw, thank you.
Okay.
Oh, shoot.
Shoot, she fell off.
Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.
Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.
I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
Oh, my God.  I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'
Aw, we're doing it.
We're really parents now.
Oh, hey, Isabelle.
Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
Oh, my gosh.
No, not at all.
Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
Okay, please hurry.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
Hi.  We did it.
I used a variation of your move.
It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.
[over phone] Hey baby, what's up?
Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
[on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!
[through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.
I want her to meet Michael.
They're both single, I have a sense they might-
It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
Hey, how are you?
Aw!
Yeah!
Hey, Michael.
This is my friend Julie.
Julie laughs at everything.
Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
You want to play pool?
Ok.
Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]
Why are you wearing a hat now?
Maybe.
Maybe it should come from a man.
Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
You guys are stripes, I think...
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Really?
I'm sorry, he's not usually like that.
He's more, just... like... you can go.
Okay. Bye.
Yeah.
Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.
Okay, we have to get home.
Not at all.
Hey, thanks.
It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
It's nice to see you again, Dwight.
[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
No, no, he's right.
That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!
What are you doing?!
Relax?!
Give it back to me now.
It's disgusting!
It's not sterile!
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
No, no never.
[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'
What? What do you mean, suspend me?
Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
Yeah. And he worked here too.
No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek]
[answers phone] Hey Toby.
Very interesting.
[Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.
I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
Yeah. 'I vant to count to ten'.
That would have been funny.
You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'
This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
[vaudeville delivery] Yee.
Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
I'll have one.
Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.
Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
I was after your money.
Yes, it was.
Hmm?
Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.
Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.
Michael...
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
I'm sorry.
Michael! [sighs]
It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'
Stanley got to go.
No, Michael, no.
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
That is right. Don't make any more of it.
How what?
You could start by concluding this meeting.
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
Oh!...
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
Helene.
My mother.
My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]
Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.
Hey, Michael.
I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
And...
No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?
Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office]
I don't know who he is.
What?
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
You have to settle down first.
Okay. Okay. Yes.
Yeah, but you have to calm...
Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
[gasps] Did she see me?
What flavors did you get? [yawns]
[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
No, out! Get out now! Leave now.
Leave!
Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
Could he still be seeing her?
Me too!
Hey Michael.
We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Yes.
[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
You were supposed to be the Lookout.
So embarrassing.
We will be well-rested tomorrow.
I don't think those were yours to take.
Did you talk to him?
You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
I don't think I'm gonna make it.
[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
Well, it does and it doesn't.
You sleep in the warehouse?
Okay.
It was me.
Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
Her husband's a reporter.
So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
That fast?
[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.
Um...
We're not going for yogurt.
Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
Yes, it's totally obvious.
[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
Sorry.
It was really funny.
I love you.
Why is there a circle with a line through it?
Or enough for everyone?
Get whatever you want, on me.
I don't know. That usually works.
I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.
Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
Dwight is about to get so Pammed.
Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
There we go.
Let's just calm down.
I don't-
Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!
Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
You've gotta be kidding me.
Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
They do call me that.
Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.
Yeah.
Stop drinking the water! Stop!
We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...
Were you painting in the dark?
I don't really think we need...
Yeah.
And a soy sauce packet.
[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
Tell me I'm good at sales.
The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
Yeah, what happened Dwight?
So what happened?
[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!
Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
I get paid $40,000 per year.
Maybe $50,000.
No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.
I liked them.
Hey, do you have a second?
Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.
I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]
There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
We can do that.
Easily.
But of course!
So weird that there is no paperwork.
Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
Admit what?
Say it.
Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
Sure. Anything else?
I'll get it right away.
The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.
We'll keep looking.
I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
Yeah.
Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!
We can relax.
Sounds like Cece.
[sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!
Why are you here?
What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.
You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
Okay.
Not together!
This night was a disaster.
Yeah?
Get it.
Let's get our juice on.
No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees]
[Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!
Yeah, go away. [Kelly nodding]
What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
Andy that's way too personal of a question.
Okay.
[crashing sound] Michael!
Come on, Michael! Yeah!
Not the car!
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
You don't?
Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]
People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
What?
I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.
And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.
It was two.
No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...
Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.
Hmm-mm.
Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
Michael, this is a bad idea.
Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
Angela as the nurse!
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'
Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
Oh, wow!
Aww, my hero!
Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.
I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]
Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.
And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
Cece's getting christened today.
Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
Oh, Michael, this is just for family.
Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.
I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.
Okay, thank you.
Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.
No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.
[looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change.
Well, she can't bring this up with her.
[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?
Honey, no.
No, no.
We have an extra outfit in the bag.
You said you checked it.
Wow.
We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.
[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
I don't know. I'm just hungry.
[sighs] Cece went down.
Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.
Who the heck was that?
We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
[walks up] Honey.
Did you lose Cece?
She's up! Great!
Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
You have a gun in your desk?
Maybe I should go.
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
I can't even talk about it.
I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
It's a miracle. She loves him.
No no no no no! She'll wake up!
Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
Absolutely! [starts out]
Do it!
Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves]
[knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
Yes! I have been so authorized.
Okay.
You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
You're typing 'Big Boobs'?
Mm-Hmm?
Okay.
Oh, it's okay.
Let it go.
Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
What do you want to say, Michael?
Really?! Who?!
Did you prank Dwight?
Well, you like that.
I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Ryan, just tell us your plan.
Oh, God!
I move we sell!
Sell.
Hi, Michael.
Oh, we don't recycle.
I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
Listen, I know you really like Ryan--
Michael, I... [sits down] I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?
Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
Don't.
Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
Okay. Go Ahead.
Do you mind?
You don't have to do that.
Are you okay, what's wrong?
Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.
I'm not going to do that.
Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.
Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
Sure.
[hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
Dwight take it down.
I'm serious, take it down or else.
We can move out.
So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?
I went out to look for a better office space.
Not really, because I found one.
Yup.
Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
They're not of Cece.
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
Koreans.
White.
Parley?
So everyone here knows pirate code?
You've been watering down the soap?
We need everything back the way it was.
That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]
I know, because you're the reason we're moving.
Uhh, I think it's something like umm...
Umm, let me see.
Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.
Mmhmm.
I lied about some aspects of the building.
There's no building... it doesn't exist.
I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...
Fail. I don't want to fail... again.
And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.
Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?
What?
Well thanks.
Hello, hello. You're breaking the law.
Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.
Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.
Okay.
I'm freezing.
I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
It hardly looks fake. It's so lush.
Great.
Nope.
Nashua got mp3 players.
Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.
I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.
Hey.
Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
Okay.
I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.
No, it has the little...
Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Cool.
Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.
Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.
Hey, how about this one?
Maybe. I mean...
Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.
Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.
You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
Hey guys, the tree's here.
Who told you that?
Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
Wow, an ultimatum.
It doesn't really seem like you.
So, cool right?
Okay.
Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
No.
Yup.
No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
Look at this.
Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
Oh, my goodness.
Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?
Thank you.
[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it]
[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.
I love it.
Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.
Michael, wait!
That's good advice.
That's a sad story.
Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.
I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
So just be patient.
Hey, sorry. I'm ready.
Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]
I'm sorry. I had no idea.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
What?
What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!
Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
It's gonna be fun.
I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome.
Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year's resolution board.
Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards.
Why not?
Learn to cook for one!
Well, maybe you'll meet someone.
Angela.
Make time for romance!
I don't think so.
No.
I'm not... I'm not going to have...
No! Just talk to her.
There's a plan.
The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee]
Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
How is it going?
One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
Yeah.
But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying.  In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?
Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
You don't have to do that, Kevin.
Oh, Michael.
Okay, Michael, just settle down.
Kevin, don't! Come on!
Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
Okay, that's it.
[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.
What's going on? Do you know that guy?
Jelp?' J-e-l-p?
I don't think that's a word.
You want some help?
Mm-hmm.
K-a. 'Ka'? What does 'ka' mean?
No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?
I think there's better...
You could have just told us what you were thinking.
There's no yelling in that, either.
Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
I don't know. They're still in there.
Stop. Out with it.
Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.
And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
And Tom...
And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
Right. But how'd you say it?
Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
Bye.
Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny 'Jim' game.
All right, what'd you do?
Where'd you put it?
Say it. Where?
The fridge.
The fridge, got it.
Bye.
This is Pam.
What's wrong?
Jim, what?
Oh God! What?!
Ok. She's ok?
Understood.
Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?
Alright, just call me after the doctor.
Bye.
Yeah.
Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
Well the first one has a surprise factor. 'I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!'
But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Oh, hey Dwight.
No, he hasn't.
No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...
Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
Ta-da!
Yeah?
Seriously?
Oh! Ok.
Guess not.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
Hey. How you doing?
Yeah.
At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
I'm so sorry.
How much did you give him?
Wait. I don't have my scarf.
I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh]
[loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful!
Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?
Yeah. What? Us?
Yeah!
Yeah!
That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?
You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.
Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
No, we weren't.
No.
That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.
Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.
Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.
No.
We took a walk.
We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.
Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
We'd love to see it!
Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.
I just helped someone out. It feels good.
So you know the feeling.
[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
He's seriously awful!
United front...
You have a computer Andy.
Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Sorry Andy.
[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
What? Erin is that true?
Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
I'm not freaking out, Andy.
Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
Switch the computers back Andy.
Seriously.
Now please.
I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
[looking confused] You did that?
Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
Andy, this is the deal we made.
We should break this hinge maybe.
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
Yep. Lucked out.
Yep, super lucky.
[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
Three. [Daryl nods]
I'm full on corrupt!
Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
Oh.
Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
The signs will drive people inside.
Oh, which one is decaf?
[looks out window] Michael! Michael!
Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
Why do you need more gas?
Is it a good message or a bad message?
Are you proposing!?
Wow.
Yea. Yea no problem. [runs away]
Yep.
Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
This is terrible.
You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.
You called the meeting I don't..
Michael.
We are a family.
And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
So about this proposal thing...
Michael, she's perfect for you.
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
Holy s*** is that real?
No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
She's not gonna say no.
You were scared?
Congratulations!
Well, it wasn't an affair.
But, no, but we are a family.
Cecelia.
Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
Da-das.
See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
What's going on?
Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']
Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?
What's wrong?
Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
What?
Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
You didn't think to mention me huh?
[annoyed] Why?
Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
In costumes!
What's wrong with cupcakes?
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
We thought.
So this is the dream team.
[surprised] Okay.
Should we get toppings?
[confused] What?
Hot fudge?
[Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
[in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
I don't, I don't think we sh-
[stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
You know what, I think we should get some other input.
Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
[walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
Good morning, Deangelo.
Okay.
Because of the flowers.
Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She's got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
Okay.
Oh my God, he hates me!
I know.
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
Oh wow, you weren't kidding.
[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
So, umm, is this your first office job then?
Wow.
Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
[to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
Okay, well it's just really loud.
You're back in.
We could get Deangelo flowers.
What have you done?
Can't stay there all day.
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Stop stalling! Come on.
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
You shot a gun off -
What are we doing?
We need a new manager.
[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
That's not accurate.
How is this on me?
Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
They're the same picture.
The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
Did you see him at a bathhouse?
The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
You're in the gay mafia.
No.
I'm a woman. I would want to know.
She does seem happy.
Okay.
Uh, just put him through to me.
Hello! This is... the client.
Yes.
Great.
Thank you, bye-bye.
That was our dream wedding.
[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?
Well, okay!
I don���t think I should.
Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly]
Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
Wait, when did we start calling it that-
Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
Because everything makes me cry, so what���s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
Not enough though.
Jim. [motions him over]
If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
Maybe it���s a list of people he���s gonna fire.
���Scuse me?
I love you so much. [starting to cry]
Okay. [turns to computer]
Okay.
That���s regular pizza.
[Pam���s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. ���This is getting very weird. Will explain later.���
[Everyone���s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Kevin.
I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ���Who���s that receptionist? I like her.��� Now I���m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you���re like, ���Oh, loser.���
Oh. Oh God.
Yeah, I���m fine.
Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?
Okay, I know I���ve been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, ���Pam��� and ���Cece��� on one side, ���Everything else��� on the other] I mean, that���s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it���s stupid. No. [starts crying] It���s wonderful. I���m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
[weepy] Yeah, I hate those endings.
Oh! Text from Jim. ���This is...��� hmm.
Kevin, do you feel OK?
Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
No he hasn���t.
Kevin, at most you���re saving a microscopic amount of time.
Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
It���s huge.  How much does it weigh?
Erin, you don���t need to call him that.
Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici���s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
I flipped through it.
Of course.
Yeah.
That sounds nice.
I do.
Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.
Oh. [smiling]
Yeah! Whoo! [Group cheers]
Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman���s?
Where���s Angela? [Hands paper over her shoulder]
Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] ���I���m not as think as you drunk I am!��� [crowd claps and cheers]
Do Not Resuscitate���[mild cheering]
Oh, and then this was Phyllis���s idea���[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!
We were hoping you could do something like this���
Baby.
Yes.
Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments.
Just a few adjustments
Um, what should we talk about?
Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
Angela, that���s pretty transparently me.
You know it���s just herbal tea.
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we���re in this together.
Fine.
I don't like that clip.
What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?
Awesome.
And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
And then my handsome husband...
Would bring me a flavored coffee.
Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
Oh, thank you.
Wait, wait. What's this? [holds up clipboard]
It says ���Lotto Pool���, right on top. [points to obvious title]
Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
No.
Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs]
You came in at 10:30 today, right?
So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....
And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.
Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
Just like now.
Oh..
What are you gonna do?
Andy, somebody defaced it.
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
How is that better than a barbecue?
Nope.
Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.
[giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather.
I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
What are they doing?
Nice touch.
Yeah, she just went down.
Aww.
Yes, after my grandfather.
Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that.
You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months?
Yeah.
[faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing?
Oh. [sends fax, Erin nods] Are you...
Oh, Erin...
Um, 2?
No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
Yeah.
Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
Hey!
What do you mean?
I saw a ghost.
It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
[answers phone] Pam Halpert.
Is it called Ghostbusters?
It didn���t look like that.
Ok fine I���ll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws]
Mmhmm.  Dwight are you eating a stick?
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
Really.
I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim.
I'm not gonna lie to her, either.
Thank you.
This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
No, Creed.
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
I bet he went home.
What are you doing?
Uhm.
Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]
Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?
No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
I'm thinking cow-
Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
Just trust me.
I got this.
Hahhh, thanks for everything.
[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!
This could be real. Dwight's pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.
You couldn't fix it.
Yes you were.
I don't think so, babe.
Hey Cathy.
How���s it going? Everything make sense?
Great.
Oh no, I���m fine.
Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
I���m training a temp to be my replacement while I���m on maternity leave. Oh I should���ve mentioned I���m pregnant. You probably didn���t notice because it���s impossible to tell I���m so small. But yeah I���m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!
You doubt it?
Why do you doubt that she���s single?
It���s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam���s desk huh?
I���m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She���s obviously super cute I get it. But I���d like to point out there���s 50 pounds more of me to love if that���s your thing.
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
Really well thank you all.
Hey.
Helen Mirren. Hot?
Huh. What about Cathy?
Yeah. Do you think she's hot?
I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
You don't find Cathy attractive?
Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
Yes, because she's hot, right?
The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.
Dwight, am I hot right now?
What about before? Was I attractive before?
Hmm. I think Jim���s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
Yep, that's the Dwight I need.
Okay.
I think so. Okay.
Well, what does that... is that... okay.
Yep, good.
Honesty is very important to me.
Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
Hmm.
Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
Mike Tibbets, really?
Kelly, calm down.
I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
Jim's on to me.
Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
Yep.
No, Kelly, don't.
Is he puffing out his chest?
No. Maybe he just said something funny.
I think he's just making her laugh.
Why's he making her laugh so much?
Why was he making her laugh so much?
Oh, hey, I'll just be a second.
Okay.
Oscar, Cathy has a question!
[to Jim] Yeah?
Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.
Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?
Ah, see, was that so hard?
Really?
Wait, what?
Jim, you have high blood pressure.
Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?
When was the last time you went to the doctor?
Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.
Just go home. It doesn't matter.
[whispers to Jim] I'm gonna do it.
Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
[after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I'm going into labor!
I'm going into labor!
I'm going into labor.
Here we go!
Okay.
Oh! Oh!
I'm really in labor! This is happening!
Oh!
False alarm.
Here. Like it?
I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.
Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!
Oh, hi Stanley.
Jim.
Hey.
Hi everybody!
How about a little visit?
Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
No, it's the pacifier's turn.
[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
No, but that would've been a really good idea.
No, she brought you drawings.
She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?
No. It's crazy.
Shh.
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.
It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.
Shh.
I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier.
Okay, we're going.
Shh, shh, shh.
You want to grab her?
Here we go, here we go.
Jim.
They don't hate you.
When were you going go-karting with Darryl?
Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.
Ok, drama.
Hey guys!
[laughing] Hi.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
[laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation.
What?!
Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
When did you find time to do all this?
Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.
So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
...we wanted to say thank you-
Really?
I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
Well, let's hear it.
I like it so far.
It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
Total golf text. Send it.
Ok, read it back to me.
Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
I think you need to go to Florida.
It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..
I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
Exactly.
Alright [kiss]
Bye. Call me when you land.
Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
There. [phone rings]
Yeah?
Well I'm not the receptionist.
I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
Whoa, are those mini pizzas?
Hey, having fun?
Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
Guys, I don't like this analogy.
It's nice.
Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
No, three-month-old humans don't do that.
Angela is such a liar!
Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
Unbelievable!
Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
We are good to goooo!
We're good to goooo!
Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
Watson carpet and tile.
Hey, Darryl. You okay?
No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
My husband would tell you to go for it.
That's it, last one.
That���s true.
Weapons.
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Thank goodness he was there.
Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
1-8-5-0-5.
I just had a baby.
Wow.
How ���bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I���m not laughing at you. I���m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
[on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.
Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Did you actually try your hardest?
If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
[to Jim] Hey, stranger!
Aw, I missed you.
Aw.
[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we���ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
There���s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it���s not -- it doesn���t sound cool. You just have to see it.
Well, I guess it doesn���t look that cool either. But, it���s been up there a long time, so it���s become a pretty big deal.
Did a good job, Buddy. Now it���s time to come home.
What?
You messed up saying your name?
Robert, is Nellie our new manager?
How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
I like working here.
Phyllis.
Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.
Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.
No.
I think... you're a witch.
[drowsily] I'm amazing. [sighs]
Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
Yeah he does.
Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]
Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts]
Oh! [takes out earbuds]
Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
I know, right?
Phyllis!
Hey, what's up?
So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
What?
[laughs] Okay.
What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]
Or what if...
We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.
What are you talking about? Yes we can.
Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]
No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
Cause there's someone already here named Pam.
Oh! [laughter, murmuring]
That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
Hey Hank.
I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
Yeah, he came and went.
Let's just- let's go.
Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
Don't shake our baby?
Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
Yeah, I'm glad you said something.
Yeah, they're really great together.
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
That a couple of times-
Okay, stop.
All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.
Oh, no, no, no.
Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.
Read through the pain. Be strong.
[sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
Boo!
Barf! Ugh, you suck!
You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches.'
He is a drifter out to sea.'
It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?
Smokey, the bear?
No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
Tears of a clown!
Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
Oh, great! That sounds good!
Sounds like you're doing alright.
Oh my god!
Whoa!
Are you-- Twice! For real?
Life is Downton Abbey.
Hm-hmm.
Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
Absolutely, it's awesome--
Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
What do you feed her?
Does she smell?
Oh, it was this summer ���
Um, I am a little busy.
Yeah, I can make you a list.
Why don���t I help you now?
Okay.
So���what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
[Walks into conference room] Hey.
I stole Nellie���s phone.
What do you want from me?
Sounds like it.
Okay, that���s enough. [grabs phone]
No, no, no!
Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They���re all deleted.
Ah. Ahh. [walks out]
Hey.
Um��� yes. Definitely. With your hair ���
Certainly. Um��� you dropped your cell phone.
Yep.
No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
No, I will not.
Well ���
But sometimes he talks about flesh��� and bacchanals.
No��� don���t. Just put it out of your mind.
I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
[enters with the kids] Family picture!
What? Honey, we talked about this.
Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
No, no.
But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
Yes!
And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Yeah?
Okay.
Oh, great. Thank you.
Okay.
You ready?
There we go.
I'll just stand here?
See? That wasn't so hard.
You hit her?
Oh, Andy.
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
David, what are you doing here?
For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.
Yes, Jim���s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
He said if it takes off he���s gonna buy us a new car.
And that was our summer.
Don���t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don���t think anything���s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there���s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
Dwight!
[sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing?
I will?
Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
No.
Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
Exactly the way it is.
Yes, and there���s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
Find someone else, I don���t know. Ask Phyllis.
You ready?
Kay.
[surveying an untidy office] The building���s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we���re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
Well, it doesn���t spin. We���ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and��� you see what chore you get that day.
No, I���m familiar with spinning. It���s just that wouldn���t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
[frustrated] ���Kay.
Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
I don���t think you guys understand why we���re doing this. It���s-
I���ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here���s where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third ���chore wheel���, excited] We���ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it���s more fun this way.
[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on ���tiny wheel���] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It���s so cute no one seems to mind.
[referencing the ���tiny wheel���] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore]
[exiting house] Thanks, mom!
Yeah. I���m afraid he���s only gonna have hot dogs.
Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
Think so.
[taking glass] Thank you.
[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who���s that?
[sarcastically] Ha-ha.
No. Roy? No.
[in the car] We still surprise each other.
You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-
In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?
Tell me one thing about you I don't know.
And you thought you guys were millionaires.
Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.
Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
Uh-huh.
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
Johnny Depp. [everyone looks confused toward Toby]
I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.
OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-
I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.
Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.
[looks knowingly back] Just tell me.
Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico���s at 7:30.
Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
[asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay?
Great.
Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
[to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.
You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
What?
Sure.
So he's not related to Michelle Obama?
[laughs]
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
[laughs]
Yeah���turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again���those are the wipers. So���the���its���just. There you go! Yeah. [chuckles]  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids���red light���that it's nice to have that creative outlet���red light! Red light! Red! Red!
Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby.
Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh���no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ���New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.��� And then in parentheses, he wrote out ���as soon as possible.���
Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.
Oh���gee���I���m���
Brilliant!
Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there���s something Jim isn't telling me.
Jim? No.
Because he just loves me too much.
Good. Good. And���[Nellie hits the car against the bushes]
So what did you want to show me?
Yeah. It's really ugly
You mean me?
Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I���Nellie, this is brilliant!  [sees Jim] Hey!
What?! No! I-I got this. [Laughs] Okay?
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
I was helping Nellie drive���[Stanley interrupts]
[Jim rushes to open door for her] Thank you.
Week off. That'd be great.
Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
Yeah, OK then.
What's this?
It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
Oh my god! Ah!
You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
Oh! Yes! [Group cheers, Dwight moves to driver seat]
My name is Pam.
I like to paint.
You think you're better?
Oh no you ain't!
Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him.
Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.
Phyllis! That's not safe.
[to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset.
Please? Just make sure he's OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]
Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go?
Yeah?
You feel OK now?
Well, actually, rhubarb is-
the one pie that I don't.
Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed.
You did it.
Role call.
Hey.
I am Dr. Cinderella.
I���m an oncologist and you are a dog.
So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
Yeah, well, get used to it, bud.
You were in an a capella group?
Yeah. I mean, listen if we���re gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
I kind of am. It���s crazy.
Okay.
Okay I give up. What are you?
[laughing] Gross. I love it.
Hey, how���d it go?
Did you end up investing?
How much?
About ten?
Wow.
Wow.
No yeah. Yeah.
So did everybody ...
Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
What?
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
Talk about it now.
Jim, that was most of our savings.
We said some. We said ���some.���
We said part not all.
Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
No I���m just, I���m saying, what would happen if they didn���t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
No! No, I���m interested. I mean I think everybody���s interested in why they have to sing it.
Yeah, yeah, no, no. It���s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can���t do if you just keep singing ���Monster Mash.���
Andy's family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
Right?
[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
[On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...
He's gonna be disappointed.
[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.
[changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure.
No the paper's not toxic.
Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
Andy.
Can you go instead?
You���ve got this Schrute.
Oh, I���ll be the buyer.
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
Okay, let���s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
Okay, when you���re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
Okay, well you have to show us.
Huh. [nodding] Uh huh.
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Nellie, why don���t you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you���re listening.
Ten years ago, I didn���t care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I���m like, that poor gimp is somebody���s child.
You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
Okay, so, when you���re selling to this woman, just imagine that she���s that nice, reasonable barber.
Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
Oh, great. Oh, I���m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don���t have it.
Okay, great.
Oh my God. It���s Jan.
Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! It���s so great to see you.
What?
Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
So this was all just a trick. You don���t really have any business to give?
But not to us.
You did good, Dwight. It���s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan���s not normal. Let���s just go. She���s not going to sell to us.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
And it is so cute how she signs her name.
Oh, okay. It���s just that���s how Cece does it with the backwards ���E���s.
Oh, actually she can.
Of course.
Um... ���A���... ���X���? I don���t -- you got me.
[whispering] I���m so sorry. I hate this. You���re better.
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
Oh, my God.
Okay, you do not have to do this.
Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.
Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
That���s a license number?
Oh. Why me?
These are my painting clothes.I think I���m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]
Are you avoiding your phone call?
Last week Jim wasn���t there, and they named the company Athlead.
Tell them your opening line.
I think it���s good. He likes fishing.
[studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It���s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I���m gonna limit myself to one shrub.
Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
It���s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
I could get us a complaint.
No, I wouldn���t. I can���t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I���d like to try.
[into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I���m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ���Hey, kool-aid.��� Yeah, your mama���s fat. This is Pam Halpert.
Basically I couldn���t tell, but I think...
I-- I thought they were confused at least...
I did not know that.
I���m so sorry.
If you���re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea ��that you can���t please everybody all the time.
Shut up, Hide! ��I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I���m okay with that.
I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
I'm on it.
We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
Yes! Phyllis!
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
[Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.
Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
And that is...
That there are no rules.
You're welcome.
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.
Oh!
I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
And the fear.
Wow.
[Holds the mouse trap up] Mouse trap.
Oh, really? Already?
Well...this is it.
Shut up. I'm trying to be serious.
I can't believe this is actually happening.
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.
Okay.
Love you.
What's going on?
For what it's worth, I liked your party better.
I don't think anyone thought that.
Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.
Zero.
Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?
Jim!
Oh--Oh my god!
What happened? Did you miss your bus?
What?
Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.
Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
Oh, call me later!
Good luck!
Love you.
Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.
Stop that!
Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.
No! How? I'm so clean!
Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.
Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
Oh stop! I am so sorry!
Nothing.
I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
She's right, it works. I would imagine.
Oh! Uh, uh I'll go.
No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?
Okay.
Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
He's really making you work for it, huh?
Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.
Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?
[putting mayo on Creed's head] Creed, I'm all done. My turn.
Well, wait.
[phone rings]  Hello?
What, no. That can't...I don't...
[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
Is there a volume knob on that thing?
Meredith, I am so sorry.
I meant to say something earlier. I just...
Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
Meredith, I am so sorry about today.
I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
Get it, girl!
[Pam and Meredith singing karaoke] This one's for all you ladies out there.
Not yet.
Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
Ha ha. That���d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get��� What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn���t I think of this? Andy���s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I���m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything���s in order.
[giggles] Okay, see you later.
You ready for your interview?
Well, you shouldn���t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
Really, you can���t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he���s basically Gumby with hair. [Darryl laughs]
Good!
I just wanted to see you!
Wow, this place is��� so great. I had no idea ��� on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
Sure, no problem.
That���s sweet that he talks about me.
Well, that���s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
They���re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It���s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don���t blame Cece.
Say they don���t hire you. It���s not like you���re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
Right? Thank you! It���s just Philly. Everyone���s acting like it���s New York or Paris or London.
Not us.
Congratulations.
I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
No, I���m not upset. I���m really excited for Darryl��� Maybe I���m a little disappointed that we���ll be losing him.
[reluctantly] Everybody dance now��� [Darryl continues singing]
[shocked after seeing the torn up carpet] Hey��� What happened here?
���Are the pens here?
[on phone]: Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
You don���t remember?
[on phone to Jim] There���s nothing down here.
Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
Oh, no, Kevin, it���s not a joke. Angela���s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I���m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let���s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
Well, I���m heading out to Cece���s dance recital.
Hey, Cece, Daddy���s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
Let���s call him.
Hey, Hon, are you close?
What?
Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren���t gonna make it.
Of course.
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we���re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ���Bye, Daddy.���
Oh, I���m sorry. Sorry.
[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God!
[whispering] Um, I���m sorry. I have to go. My daughter���s a ladybug. I know that doesn���t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
Shh! Kids are dancing.
[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
Anyone want to see the video from Cece���s recital?
All right, you don���t have to.
Okay.
Wait. What?
[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
Well, it was an important phone call.
I haven���t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he���s always like, ���Beesly!��� I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- ���Beesly!��� [chuckles]
Night
Night, Creed.
Hey.
So, how���s it going?
I���m so sorry.
[sighs] Oh, I���m sorry. I feel like you���ve already been working insanely hard.
Um, actually, funny story -- I didn���t get it. I shouldn���t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
Yeah, okay, I���m sorry. I���m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
I don���t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
You know what? I-- I-- I don���t think you want to start a conversation with me about what���s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
Yep.
Yep. I���ll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye. [quietly crying, sniffling]
What am I doing wrong, Brian?
[crying]
It���s getting tougher. I just didn���t know that it was gonna be this hard.
Thank you.
Hey Brian, you got a sec?
I feel awful.
Well, thanks for being a good friend.
Yeah, mostly.
Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.
Okay. Thank you.
When are you talking to David Wallace?
Too late. My hopes are up.
[sighs] It���s fine. It���s just a seating arrangement. Doesn���t matter.
Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
Hey, I���m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim���s away. I���m in a position where I���m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
Hide, they���re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don���t you go up and get one?
Yeah.
Oh, cool. Hey Clark.
Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
Of course.
Okay.
Bye.
I���m good.
Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
Us.
Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I���ll distract him, you take that.
[shushes]
No, Dwight!
I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way!
[ascends on lift, using megaphone] Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. [no one replies] Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? [descends on lift] Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.
I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
[entering office] Conference room. Everybody. Now!
Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
Yeah.
[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
Yeah, but this is different.
I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...
Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.
You will?
Thank you.
Yeah?
Great.
I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
See, I feel bad about that.
[interrupting] Tell us who defaced the mural!
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.
What was that?
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
We should just take him down.
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
Yes!
Yes!
We need an infiltrator.
Clark?
Shh, shh.
Shh. Remember your lines.
[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
Yeah, something like that.
Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck!
OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.
Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.
Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
Yeah. I feel better.
I know. You miss Angela, don't you?
I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
No, you had no right!
So? You started it!
Whoa.
Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.
You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
Forget about my mural. It's stupid.
It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry.
Thanks, Brian.
[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.
[makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam!
And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]
[eating] These are gross.
Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
It's with Brian and Alyssa.
I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
That sounds nice.
Sorry we're late.
Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.
He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
Yeah.
Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
Where's Alyssa?
Oh.
[obviously flustered] Yeah.
OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?
I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.
It's not Brian's fault.
OK.
Oh?
Are you sure?
[obviously hurt] Yeah.
OK. [they begin to leave]
[sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this.
Thank you.
I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
Yeah, I do.
He sounds like a wounded animal.
Ok. [Andy continues moaning]
[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
[whispers] hello!
Hi! Hey, do I look ok?
Ok
[pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a-
How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
Thanks.
Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
Ha ha.
Bye.
Hello.
Hi, Pam, hello.
I'm Pam Halpert.
Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.
[Mouths] Oh my god.
Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]
So um-
Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
Yes.
Two children, yes.
I am not pr-
Pregnant, no.
Wow.
I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
So, kinda like a receptionist.
Yes.
I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
[on phone] hey!
Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
Eight? Really?
Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
Love you.
Hello?
Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.
Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.
[laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.
Guess what poster he had on his wall?
MmMm.
MmMm. You're getting colder.
[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
I don't know, but it's interesting right?
He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
Mmhm.
I don't know.
I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.
Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
��� bad.
Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.
I think it's called 'Nibbles'.
Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.
I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
Yes. He was a good spy.
Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!
[as others eat] Wait!
No, no. It's the principle of the thing.
Good morning, Erin.
Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.
Phyllis!
No!
Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
But, Kevin that's...
Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...
Yeah.
Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
[on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
[laughs] Um.
You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
Oh, oh OK.
[sighs] Um, Ok. Well?
Yeah, sounds good. Ok.
Ok.
Bye.
Uh huh.
It wasn't so bad.
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
Oh my god!
Brian?
Yeah, I guess I could.
Hey!
Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
Oh my gosh, please, don't.
Sure, yeah. Yeah.
OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view.
Oh, thank you.
Cheers.
So..
Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
Yeah. It's kinda crazy.
See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
Yeah, wasn't that neat?
Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?
Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
How much stuff you got.
Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go.
No I think you explained it.
I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. [at computer opens translator. Types in ���Elskere��� which comes back as ���lovers��� Pam smiles]
Well, we won���t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
[laughs] I wish.
Oh, nothing that exciting.
Hmm.
You know, Jim���s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
I mean, we���ve having issues. It can���t hurt to talk about them, right?
He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he��shouldn't��be rewarded for that.
I feel like he���s always making these decisions for the family, and then I���m left playing catch-up.
I���m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don���t want him to do it anymore, and I don���t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
I didn't see you! You should have yelled ���Crossing!���
Ok, so is that my spot?
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
So, we had couple's therapy.
And we have homework.
And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.
Hey!
Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice.
Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
We're not high.
I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
Ok. [intense moment where Jim leaves and Pam seems conflicted.  She notices his umbrella and runs out to follow him]
Jim! [hands him umbrella]
Alright, have a good trip.
Bye. [walks away]
I love you.
It���s great.
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Nice morning, too.
Wow.
it���s okay. You can sit in the annex.
I���ll come visit you.
Oh, Andy.
Yes. Yeah.
Oh, boy. Um���
I could give you some beginner stickies?
Here you go.
Mm-hmm.
It���s all yours.
Hey.
Hi.
Um, I have a question.
Oh, I had a question.
I did!
Super important.
Okay.
All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
I don���t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
Exactly.
I���m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it���s like a double date.
Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
Oh, well, Thursday���s tough, because of���
They are.
What���s going on?
[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight.
It���s nice to have you back.
Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
Is that them again?
Maybe you should call back?
When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he���s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he���s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
Question.
We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they���re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ���Nice jugs���?
What are you so excited about?
What are you up to?
Nice.
Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
Darryl, hey.
Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
Aha. How���s Athlead?
Wow.
He says he doesn���t want to.
Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
That���s what he says.
Hey.
Are you happy?
No, I know that you���re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
What about five years from now?
Because I���m so glad you���re back, baby, but I���m just���I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you���re giving up so much.
Okay.
I kind of forced you to do it.
Yes, I did.
I���m afraid that you���re gonna resent me and I���m afraid that���
This is not enough for you and I���m afraid that I���m not enough for you.
He does have a gift.
What is this?
Go ahead.
Yeah.
What���s that?
Thank you.
What? Dwight, you can���t do that.
Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone���s ever been fired, Toby���s blocked it, so���
[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
I think she looks good. Now that she���s wearing sports bras, we don���t see her boobs as much.
[enters] Darryl! Andy!
We���re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I���m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn���t you be?
Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How���s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
Oh, boy.
Wait, wait. What?
Uh, that seems inappropriate.
Whoo-hoo���go, Meredith���s stripper son.
No, no, I���m fine.
Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don���t know. I���m working on something.
[pause] I���m sorry. Is there a question?
Oh, um, well, you know, I��� I just��� I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you���d been filmed for nine years of your life, there���d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
Listen, um��� I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn���t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he���s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it���s better than a fairy tale. It���s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you���re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
Yeah, like Harry Potter.
Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
[with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it���s choreographed!
He just so happy to have a family plan.
Is it me? Is it Nellie?
I need to get out of this dress.
[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?
Okay, Okay. Um��� so��� this past year has been really great, and you���ve been great and I just��� I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn���t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture��� and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
About 2 months
Yeah.
Well, you��� you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
Austin? Maybe.
I���m doing it for us.
Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?
I wanna do this.
I really want to do this!
We���re so excited.
Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper���,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I���ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]
Everyone, Let���s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just���I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
Okay.
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I���m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn���t work here anymore.
I didn���t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It���s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It���d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I���m a tragic person. I���m really happy now. But���it would just���just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ���be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn���t that long.���
What about the honeymoon?
I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing���
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We���ll come back to visit. But I think it���s time for us to officially���
Thanks Dwight.
I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all���I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There���s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn���t that kind of the point?
