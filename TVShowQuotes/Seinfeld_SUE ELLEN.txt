Elaine?
Hi!
I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
I've just been hanging out.
Hmm. Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by.
Um-hm.
Nooo?
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.
Hi Elaine.
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift.
Is anything wrong?
Oh, I know. Thanks again.
Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?
Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
Oh...
No, I really just needed to speak with him. (exhales)
Oh, well maybe I will.
If you don't mind.
Thanks.
Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on.
Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.
I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
Eight thousand.
Nine thousand.
Ten thousand.
Twelve thousand.
Fourteen thousand.
Elaine? Hi.
Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.
Shouldn't he elevate his legs?
That's it! The wedding's off.
(Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!
I have never been so humiliated!
No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose!
(Walking up to the group) Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!
Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents - and they're Indian.
Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend.
Uh, this is my fianc, Pinter. (To Pinter) Say hello.
Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?
