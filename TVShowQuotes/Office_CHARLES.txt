I-I was-
Thank you.
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
Uh.
Your name is Jim?
Hey, I come from accounting, too.
Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you.
You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
That's great.
Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
You didn't tell them.
Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.
It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
No.
Saticoy Steel.
No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.
No.
Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
And what is that?
That's not how I plan on doing things.
I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
Ok.
[on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
It's no big deal.
You still have that option. [Michael sighs]
I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Ok.
That's not the way it's gonna work.
No, it is not.
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
No, seriously.
How old are you?
Five years old?
I will walk away.
What exactly is the PPC?
Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
[Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.
Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee.
Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
[Jim knocks on door] Come in.
Hey.
Number two?
Oh, I didn't know that position existed.
So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
Any responsibilities come with it?
So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
Yeah, would you, uh?
Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Okay.
For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
Jim.
what are you doing?
Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
Okay.  After you.
Okay.
You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
Come in...
Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
Hey Hank, You ready?
Okay, Michael?
I can't pretend I haven't seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can't take anything.
not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
No, no no no.  You're done, Michael.
Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
Okay, let me know if you find it.
Michael get up!
Michael, what are you doing?
Hank?  No, I don't need Hank Michael.
So, we had a personnel change today.  Shouldn't effect our day to day.  But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.
Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.
Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay?  I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good.  Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]
Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
Eh, uh, in a hotel.
Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.
Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm...
Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear 'yes'.
Good. As I was saying...
You a soccer fan?
Well, that makes two of us.
Yeah.
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
I know. Yes I do.
Oh yeah?
I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
Yeah?
That's a great idea, Dwight.
What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!
Miner - [kicking a piece of trash]
...sees his partner -
Halpert. He looks up!
Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
Jim. What do you play?
Forward or half?
Let's see what you got in those legs!
Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?
Why'd you duck, Jim?
Does that make you feel better? Huh?
Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry.
Michael, you're back.
Mmmhmm.
Hey Kelly?
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
Oh, and Kelly...
Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.
Hey Jim can I get a, um-
Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
Yeah.
As soon as possible.
Just get it right.
You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
Oh.
Okay, great.
Just keep it simple.
You're working hard? On this?
Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Hey Pam.
I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
Um.
Yeah I know.
No.
Okay.
Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
Do I need to?
What's that?
Looking good.
Dwight, take a seat.
Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
Definitely.
[Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.
No, Mich-Michael.
Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
Yes.
We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
He did.
Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?
No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
Why are you telling me this?
Is this something you really want to have said?
I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-
I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
Uh, well said, Angela.
There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?
Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad.  Hasn't been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.
I feel like I should be thanking you.
The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.
Right.
Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?
Yeah, Jim--
He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
God, no.
I agree.
Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?
Yeah.
We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
What is wrong with you?
No, Jim... I think you should go.
What?
Dwight.
What?  How'd you hear that?
So how long can they stay viable?
Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?
You two are morons.
Get out.
Oh, okay.
They don't make them anymore.
That's very kind of you to say, David.
Hey, guys--
Jim. Pam.
Nice day, huh?
Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away]
Yes we are!
Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while.
Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
I guess that's it for you, Jim.
Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
All right! Come on.
