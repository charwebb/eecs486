Great. We're all set.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.
Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.
That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
No. With more ignorance.
Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.
Right. OK.
Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...
Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.
Um...
Well, we only have an hour.
Mr. Brown.
Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.
So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.
Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?
Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.
Wait a second.
Stop it!
Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?
OK.
Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.
I can't leave until you do.
Michael, can I talk to you candidly?
We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.
Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.
Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.
Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.
Don't worry about dating.
OK. Thank you.
Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.
Does this company have 100 years to erase?
Oh right, more like 200 years.
Okay, um. Uh, I'll try to make this quick.
HERO, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Oh, nice.
Good.
Great.
Beautiful.
Oh, my sorry. That is not appropriate.
Yeah, but it's not appropriate. This is not helpful as a memory aid.
Okay, Michael, I just...
Does anyone have anything else at all? Anyone besides Michael?
Yes, please.
No, no, no, no. An outsider's perspective would probably be pretty helpful.
I'm sorry, Michael. We're actually out of time.
