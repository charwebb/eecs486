It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
I'll let him know.
Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy?
Oh! [laughs] Oof!
Oh.
Hi.
Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office.
Oh.
Ah..[laughs]
Spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh]
[laughs] Thank you.
That's uh, that's the girl you dated.
No, she, she seems fine.
OK.
Did you not...
Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
[group laughing] I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful...
Uh huh.
Um, it ta-, um it depends.
I'll see you at home?
OK
Bye [kiss]...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.
Oh
OK [laughs] Bye.
[looks at pool] Wow.
[sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?
Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?
Hey.
No, show me.
Dive in right here.
Okay. You don't know what you're doing.
[to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.
[knocks Erin off Dwight's shoulders] Yes!
Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap]
Here we go! [knocks Erin over] Yes!
I cannot believe it either.
You guys ready?
Whoo!
Yeah, come on!
Yeah!
My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
Andy! Hey!
Hey.
Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.
I dunno.
Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?
Uh, yeah. What is it?
You're breaking up with me?
Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
What?
Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
I can't say it doesn't make sense...
Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.
What are you doing here?
Go away.
