Good to see you too.
Oh, I'm just here for the coffee.
Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.
Three of you guys for one sale.
Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you.
I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.
Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit.
We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?
Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]
I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
Well, we'll get this...[Meredith unbuttons]
Hola. Que tal?
Yeah, sure.
You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-
Michael Scott.
Hmm.
But from where?
Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
Or...crazy.
I'm gonna go.
Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! [knocking on wall] Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.
What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that! [opens door to leave]
Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.
[opening door again to leave] No!
Get out of my way.
I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now.
I'm very upset!
More freedom.
Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
Yeah. Way ,way, way back.
Oh. She was not into me.
Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.
Okay...that's different.
Uh...I mean-yeah.
Thank you.
Oh.
Thanks.
Gabe-wad.
Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar.
Public School, at exit 11.
So. You're all on the list!
Okay.
Hey.
I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
For sure.
What are you talking about?
Jim and Pam really don't want you to go?
I'll talk to them.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you imagine? It's just crazy.
Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
Exactly.
No! Two or three dates.
Was it two? I thought it was three.
[laughing] Well, that does not sound like me.
[stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.
I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think.
Hey.
This is some party, huh?
Are you serious?
You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...
Okay. You wanna know?  I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky.
