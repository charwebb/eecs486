I'll get that for you.
Okay.  Let me feel here.
Yeah, it's quite full.  Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
Okay.
Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?
Stimulate it.
Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
It doesn't...  Why don't you bring your baby over here...  She's beautiful.
Yes, congratulations.
Well, you're doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
[Playing computer game with Toby] You���re looking good.
I love it.
No, I prefer Fart.
I don���t either.
Yep, body by Cheez-it
I think I���m busy that night. Or I would.
Learning what?
Kay.
Is this���is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that���s totally fine. Like, I���m fine with it. But you should know that I���m into the ladies.
You know, if you���re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven���t had time to pursue yet?
Yeah, I���ll just give it a glance���
I���ll give it a read.
Yeah.
I am.
Ok.
Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
Ok
I���ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
Alright, let���s see you do it.
You got this, it���s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It���s not a race, Dwight.
Well, you know, I���m also Customer Service.
[looking down at Erin���s desk] Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election��� thing is crazy, right?
[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?
Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.
You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh?
[Pete looks on disappointed] Ok.
Think it over. [punches Pete]
Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.
And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
I absolutely will do that.
Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.
[whispering to Pete] Whatever it takes.
[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.
Come in.
Come on in.
[to Pete] What're you doing here?
All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.
Yep, she's done.
No, we got it. We got it.
OK, I don't.
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
Oooohhhhhhhh!
It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
Just clap through it, man.
I don't want to teach you Power Point.
Just do the tutorial.
No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.
Mm-mm.
So Creed is that dude's step dad?
Stretch. Alright.
I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue.
It's a medical thing.
I'm good. I..
Come back.
Mmm.
What?
I do. I love the boss���s interests.
Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where���s the band? ���Cause there���s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
What, am I overdoing it? No. No.
Yes! All right!
That���s how you do that! Whoo!
So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
God!
Where���s the Quizno���s?
Do what? Get into sales? That���s what I want.
Hey guys.
A gentleman doesn���t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was��� like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh��� like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
What���s with the wig Meredith?
Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It���s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so��� bon appetite.
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
[sarcastically chuckling] I loved it.
If it���ll lead to me being a salesman, I���ll pretend to be your friend.
No, we sure hadn���t Pop. [both chuckling]
He calls me Clarky ���cause he���s my Dad.
My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he���s like a serial killer��� of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]
[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but��� God I missed you!
[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
���And I love you, for saying that.
[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is��� our relationship is��� terr-
Terrible.
So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.
Well, I understand, but ���
Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.
Women don���t despise me���
Alright, that���s enough, ���cause I can say some things about him too.
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then��� Killed those kids on their way to prom!
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
There���s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
Hi, I���m Clark.
Let���s talk.
So if you look at our catalog here���
I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad���s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That���s why his face always breaks out.
You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I���m going to need one right? If I���m ever going to get a ���real job��� and move my ���lazy ass��� out of your ���G.D. house���.
Well, that���s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
[emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?
You opened the door-
Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
Why?
They got us set up with Windows 95, ��so you���re kind of dreaming here.
Hey, so I hear you���re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
Well, uh��� see, you raised it.
You know what, man? I deserve this job.
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond��� and under.
This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?
Well, I wouldn���t be so sure about that. I mean, I���ve been working here 12 weeks. That���s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we���ve seen.
Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.
There he is.
Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?
Thanks, dude. You���you sure it���s okay? ���Cause you���re kinda���
Oh, Dove Men.
Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
Thanks, dude.
Why?
[exhales]
Wintergreen.
Yeah, good nose.
That���s just a classic no-win situation.
So I���d Kobayashi Maru it.
Yep.
You know what, Dwight?
This interview���s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru���d the whole process.
Yeah. Star Trek rules.
Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
So how���d you guys hear about the position?
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
So you guys all know Dwight already?
X-Men school?
What���s up good lookin���?
Hey, Pam, I���m going to the kitchen. You want anything?
Oh, I���m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
No!
Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
This is never gonna work.
What lines?
It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave]
Kay. [removes glasses]
Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together.
She's living a lie.
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
[emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.
Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless.
They're tasteful.
Perfect height, yeah.
Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
There you go, good for you.
You just let it all hang out, that's what...
I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
Hmm.
So Pete was a librarian?
Was he like the sexy librarian?
No.
[to Pam] Who's this guy?
Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.
You didn't actually say that.
Packer laced the cupcakes.
I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
It's porn.
What's her name?
Sweet.
Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
Oh.
The same thing that you think.
God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?
Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga! [laughs]
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
One second.
One second.
Don't do it. [takes Dwight's pen]
Dude, we're being conned.
These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
I don't even know what an auger is!
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for?
My mistake.
Hey, Dwight.
Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
Holy [bleep].
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren���t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
You gave him three shots.
All right.
We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
I am!
Any good weekend plans?
Nice.
Uh, I don���t know yet.
I was thinking about���
And then what?
Well, if I may, you���re a natural.
That���s a little weird.
[connect helmet straps around Stanley���s head] That���s about as good as that���s gonna be.
Catch?
I can���t catch him. He���s like, 250 pounds.
Blunt?
Dude, this size of my haunches��� [Stanley���s body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]
We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
We can���t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
That���s actually really smart.
God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
Hey, wait, wait, how���how are we doing this?
Just say ���arms��� and ���legs,��� okay? That just���that���s the vernacular that I���m comfortable with.
[sighs]
Wha���What���s a shank?
All right.
Yeah���yup yup.
What?
Aw, come on.
Damn it.
Okay. We, hey���hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
Isn���t the client, like, best friends with his sister?
Driving.
Quater finals in an hour.  Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
Did you? [pushes pencil cup at Erin]
Oh, wide wings, interesting.
We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won...
Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
Right. Yeah. But, you know, I���ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I���ve earned this. I mean, you know?
Right. Well, I���m here to sell paper.
All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And���and Wallace is here today. And I don���t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
That���s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete���s beautiful, dead eyes.
Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
All I���m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager���s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
Congrats, Dwight.
But I fought for this seat.
Yeah.
I would love a corn dog.
[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.���
Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
Hey, how was the singing show audition?
Great, now we got three hours to fill.
Here we go!
Dwight, for the last time, she���s not a waitress.
