Yeah, sure.
Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim?
You're wearing the beanie. You like it?
Okay.
And delivered.
Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
The Doc crew���s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
You know, you are just as dumb at night.
OK.
It's how it has to be.
Yeah, that's her.
It has been delivered.
Yup, yup.
I caught it.
That's what I'm sayin'.
Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?
Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work.
Calm down, he's not.
Promise me you're going to clean up.
Yeaha���yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.
No.
Thanks, they're from my mom.
I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.

Me neither. Come here. [she hugs Darryl, and Darryl smiles behind her back]
No, I'm good. Thank you.
How you doing?

Since when does a sweater mean ���dressed up���? Am I your grandson?
Thank you.
Hey.
Don't quit. [Darryl eavesdropping, nods]
Wow. Those are really nice.
Honey, I am not sleeping with-
You in?
Okay, thanks.
[comes up from under water] How was that?
I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?
Hey.
What should I wear?
Isn't that just for popsicles?
Can't wait.
Ok, thank you. Is that all?

Come on.
Promise me that-
