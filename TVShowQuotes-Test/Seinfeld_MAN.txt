Hey!
Do I have to dial a one first?
Alright, see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey.
She passed.
(to George) Hey, do you have the time?
I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. (He starts pulling her to safety)
She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.
I told you, it's right over there.
646?
Now I got you!
Are you through? (annoyed)
These clothes. The ones you're wearing.
But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!
(Off-screen) Hey, shut up up there!
