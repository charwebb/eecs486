I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
An antacid that you only take once a week.
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
What does this mean? What does it mean!
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
