Angela.
Exactly.
Oh, I don���t know.
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Where are we going?
Wag.
Well, I am. [hugs Michael]
Hi.
Don't push it.
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
Come on Jim, you're killing her!
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
Excellent.
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
Hey! I can make that error.
As has Kevin!
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
It's out in the hall.
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Cause, you're the boss!
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
It smells like cookies.
Already sent it to you my friend.
Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
Let���s get this over with, Pam.
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
Yes! [giggles and picks up Angela]
[giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
Because you're gay.
I said see you later building.
What does that mean?
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
[music plays] Whoo!
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
[in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God.
We did it.
Good thing you didn't listen to me.
I don���t know.
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Wha...
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
Is everything ok, Michael?
That���s not���
That is a dangerous game, friendo.
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
Yeah?
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
[rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] Fire!
[Mouths 'hi' at the stripper]
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
What -
Hey, man.
Romances?
That is my name.
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
Will you take a check?
Wow!
Yes, thank you.
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
Better luck next time, pal.
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
You weren't here for that.
Of course.
[nods]
Can I join too?
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
What?
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
On what?
Are you on email?
Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
This is getting weird.
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
Or carnivals!
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
Right.
It was kind of hard to hear.
What?
Ok.
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
Come on, the Three Amigos.
That could be a good sign.
Packer said it.
[whispers to Erin] I'm gonna kill you.
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
Didn't you two used to do it?
Hey, you going tonight?
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
Three hundred pounds!
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
You're in here.
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Oh.
Dude, you will not be sorry.
She thought I was your boyfriend.
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
[Email chiming] [snickers] Did you see that?
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
No. Yes!
Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Oh!
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
Hi Jan.
The tires look pretty worn.
Oh, the other one's watching.
Whoa.
Hidden from [whisper] them.
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
Nicely done!
I don't feel anything.
Yeah, thank you Phyllis.
Wow.
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
Phillip is so fat.
It's a bitter situation.
Make it go taller.
What's going on?
So, there was talk of oatmeal.
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
Yeah, I think she's full of it.
Hi.
Yeah.
Guys.
Wait, what?
Well, I heard they made out
Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
No.
[in accent] 'ello, mate!
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
Yeah [all murmuring]
Hold it.
Way to go, man.
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
An antacid that you only take once a week.
Jim has got it bad for Pam.
No-
Right.
Then why don't you do something about it?
Hi!
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
She looks like a monster.
Oh yeah!
It feels amazing!
Hey, Kelly; I called him Fire Guy.
