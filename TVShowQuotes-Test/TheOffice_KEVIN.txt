When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
