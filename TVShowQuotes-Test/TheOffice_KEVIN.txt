Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
I do not want to talk about it.
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
An antacid that you only take once a week.
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
Oh, will we get to see that look?
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
