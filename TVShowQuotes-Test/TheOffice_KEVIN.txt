The thing you just said?
I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
Hi Jan.
You aren't curious?
Your arm feels good on my back.
Wow!
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
No!
You're wearing a woman's suit?
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
Who makes it?
Yes! [hugs Angela]
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
[sarcastically] Oh, I bet you like it.
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
Come on, the Three Amigos.
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
Next stop pies!
...unbelievable.
We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.
[rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] Fire!
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
It's been out for ages, man.
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
Kevin.
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
We need to assemble the five families.
[holding mobile phone up] Go.
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
Jim said that?
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
Cool. Superhero.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
Michael's a genius.
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
You weren't here for that.
Fine, fine.  I���ll talk normally.
Isn't it supposed to be, 'Drive safely'?
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
Yeah! Tell us a story.
You got outdoors time?
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Right.
Well, what if you're cold?
Big mistake.
[paper football lands on desk] Ooh.
Yeah.
Way to go, man.
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
Then why don't you do something about it?
Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
Hi, Creed, what's up?
Okay.
No, no.
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
Yeah!
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
That's beautiful. No, I totally get that.
Nothing.
I've dumped better than Erin.
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
Staples.
I think it's over, man.
I'd like a magazine.
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
Okay, Penguin. [laughs]
I'm not crying.
What?
Bye.
I do.
[counting votes] Five. Five to five.
Yeah! [hugs Pam]
I am so sorry.
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Packer said it.
Yeah!
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
Yeah [kisses Darryl on the cheek]
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
What does a bean mean?
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?
God, I hate it.
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Pam, look out!
Still scary.
Angela, this is inappropriate.
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
So did you hear?
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
Pam.
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
Yes! Wait, why?
No.
That's hilarious.
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
Yes!
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Hungrier.
You know.
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
[everyone applauding] Awesome!
Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis.
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
[blows a sigh of relief]
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
I'm on it.
Yeah Jim, why's it so far?
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
That could be a good sign.
Wha-- wh--
Yes!
Oh, the other one's watching.
Michael.
Four!
What is it?
Yeah.
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
Yes!
You could put a banana in it.
Oh.
Oh, but you still said 'I'm sorry.'
Three queens.
What do you mean?
Really?
Oh God.
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
Well, I heard they made out
I wonder what he did.
That���s a flush.
Yeah.
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
Because of sex?
Can I get some candy, or something?
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
Open QuickTime.
Nice!
Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises]
