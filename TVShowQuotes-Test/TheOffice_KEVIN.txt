I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
