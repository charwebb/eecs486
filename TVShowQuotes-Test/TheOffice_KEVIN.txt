Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
But I do like her just the way she is.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
I do not want to talk about it.
I heard they made out and had sex.
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
