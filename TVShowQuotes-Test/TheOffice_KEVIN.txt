Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
What does this mean? What does it mean!
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
