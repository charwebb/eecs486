[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
Nice!
No way!
Okay, I got this one.
Jan.
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
Jan?  What's new?
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
Yeah.
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
He's not my client.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
I can do that.
Hey! I can make that error.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
They were stolen?
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
Yes.
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
[shakes head no]
I do gamble Michael.
Whoa.
Hey guys it's my turn.
The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
Yeah.
Oh, I missed you so much.
Yes!
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
Pete what?
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
Pam's back on the market again.
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises]
Can I have your pencils?
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
What
Oh, but you still said 'I'm sorry.'
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
Yes.
[paper football lands on desk] Ooh.
T.
What does this mean? What does it mean!
Oh...
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
Hi Jan.
Well, Hol, this is it.
Packer said it.
Here...
Yeah... hey Stanley-
Then why don't you do something about it?
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
Please, stop.
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
What?
When will the new copier be ready?
Where are we going?
Yes.
We're here for the show, Michael.
[rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] Fire!
Hi!
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
[answers phone] Hello.
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
Oh God.
That was so awesome.
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
We do.
Back off me.
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
Butt honking.
No me fault.
What happened?
I'll go to the diner with you.
About what?
Go ahead.
Kevin Malone.
oooh
Hey, we're gonna do this...
Do you think we should go ?
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
I'm going to!
Yeah.
[smiles] I like it.
Are those the lyrics?
[counting votes] Five. Five to five.
Well, w���
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
Even I know that's weird.
How 'bout Cooper's then?
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
Thank you, Michael.
Well, I am. [hugs Michael]
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
We need to assemble the five families.
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
Jim said that?
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
Don���t tell me what to do!
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
This is getting weird.
Totally. George Clooney.
Yeah.
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
Stick spicy food up her butt.
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.
Why don't you go Michael?
Man, that thing's bigger than I am.
Kevin Malone.
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
You don't know that.
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
Really?
I'm going to call him Little Kevin.
Or carnivals!
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
We did it.
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
Yeah.
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
What���s happening in three months?
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
Cause, you're the boss!
Y'all.
[crying] At least I got chocolate.
Oscar.  Angela.
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
It was me.
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
That's a real thing.
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
Yeah Jim, why's it so far?
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
Yeah! [hugs Pam]
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
