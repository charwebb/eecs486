You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh?
They're tasteful.
Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.
You got this, it���s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It���s not a race, Dwight.
Come in.

Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.
Wintergreen.

Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
Dude, we're being conned.
You know what, man? I deserve this job.
Ok.

It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
You opened the door-
Oh, Dove Men.
[whispering to Pete] Whatever it takes.
Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where���s the band? ���Cause there���s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
I'm good. I..
Hmm.
