I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!
My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table)
What happened?
Guess you better keep on his good side.
