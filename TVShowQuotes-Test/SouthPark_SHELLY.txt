Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. 

Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!

Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! 

No.

Geez, what's up Dad's ass?

You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.

She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!

Turd Rock From the Sun!

There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!

I placed his underwear over his head.

You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!

Go! Go! 

Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!

Hey, Skyler.

I can't find it. Somebody took it.

I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!

No, Skyler. Quit it.

Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!

Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!
