It's gonna kill us!

Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!

What do you say, Stanley?

I will.

Me neither.

I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all.

Guess again, Richard the Turd!

Oh my Gohhhd!

Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. 

And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! 

No, Skyler. Quit it.

What do you want, Larry? 

No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.

That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!

Who said that? 

It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! 

Turd Rock From the Sun!

You little liar. 

We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!
