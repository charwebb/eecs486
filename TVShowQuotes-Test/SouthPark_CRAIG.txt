That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.
Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is."
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. 
It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master.

Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.
Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?
Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?
It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
