Dude, what's the matter with him?

Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.

I gotta show this to my mom! 

Aha!  There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! 

Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!

Not as gay as us, though.

Okay. 

Yeah, don't just "Oh" me!

Stuff just happens.

...Yeah.

What are you talking about?

I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.

Huh?

You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl?

I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! 

Dude, this game rules.

Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.

At Red Robin?

It's a rat! 

You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!

My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.

It's Spaceman Craig. 

It just looked like you cut it off, that's all.

Yeah. It kinda does. 

Right. Let's all get PS4s.

I didn't say anything.

I don't know.

How can I resist an ass so great?

Hey Clyde. Nice score, dude.

Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you?

Sure is!

He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say "shitballs" to the principal I'd be sooo happy.
