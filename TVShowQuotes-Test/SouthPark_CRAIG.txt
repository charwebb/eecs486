"Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole." 
Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.
Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.
We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!
Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.
I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.
I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.
I am not Craig,  I am Ginza,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!
You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?
Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones?Â 
Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso!
