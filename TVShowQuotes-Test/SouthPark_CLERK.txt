Hello, you interested in the Stanground braceleh-OH! Wow, it's you!  Stanground, brah!
Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?
Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
All right, you guys look ready to zipline!
What do you mean "back then"? Don't forget, it's 1864.
Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.
