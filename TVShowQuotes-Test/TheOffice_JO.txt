He's in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi! [everyone in the audience is laughing]
I hope your rough patch ends soon.
Really?
Yeah, but see... it's not.
Well, I'm inclined to believe you.
Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.
Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!
Well, buy property. That's my advice.
How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?
Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
Enough!
Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.
Which are?
Hmm.
Hey there.
Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?
You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
Well, anytime now.
Oh, God. How far has it gone?
