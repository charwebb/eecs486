Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
(hanging up) Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.
I feel ten years younger.
And I can breathe easier, too.
I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand)
Five dollars a game, huh?
What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?
(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
You still need a cook?
You were the one who smothered him.
Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.
(anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
Hello, woman. (leaves)
You sayin' you want a piece of me?
(Complaining) I can't make anything..
You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.
How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
Definitely velcro.
You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.
Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!
(yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?" (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.
Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
(looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?
It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
Okay, where's my boy?
They made a derogatory comment about me.
I still say we're related.
We had some good times.
What's that?
How hard could it be to kill this thing?
You want me to wear a bra?!
Hey! Lloyd!
Yeah, we worked it out.
Let's begin.
