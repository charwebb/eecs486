My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.

Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?

(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this.
Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
