In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short.
(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
Except, we gotta do something about the name.
You come here.
I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.
Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!
Do you think you can handle it?
(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?
What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
How hard could it be to kill this thing?
Like you wouldn't believe.
What?
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.
Serenity now!
We're having an upscale dinner.
(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!
I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
This is the best Festivus ever!
They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
Get the hell out of here. He's getting married?
Where's your friend Kramer?
Maybe?
You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!
That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back
Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.
You're not kidding it's a good move!
Where the hell is my paper?
The man on the tape wasn't specific.
(putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt.
What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
Okay, THAT'S IT! "oki on awa" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.
(Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)
That's your mother's new car.
So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
Read that poem.
(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?
Why should they go to waste?!?
Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.
Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.
