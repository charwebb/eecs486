There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.
Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
(hanging up) Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.
They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.
That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?
But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.
Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, " eno enoa juang ". Which means, "this guy - this is not my kind of guy".
(Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this.
George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
(looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
(to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!!
Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
(grabbing the card) Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.
I don't think you did such a good job on these...
Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...
No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
