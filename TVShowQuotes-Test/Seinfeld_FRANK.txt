Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!
I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
What was that?
(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
(Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this.
Okay.
That's it! You're grounded!
(looks up to heaven) She's deceased.
Do you think you can handle it?
Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
I'd know him anywhere.
Also internal problems.
Will you put her to rest for me?
Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
Stop crying, and fight your father!
You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!
(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!
Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!
So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
Your mother recommended him.
(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.
Five dollars a game, huh?
(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
She'd never make it.
No! You never said milky white!
Thank you.
George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
Like you wouldn't believe.
Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
Get outta here! We have a booth.
Under arrest? What for?
What, they brainwashed you?
(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
And stay away from those squirrels.
You like to gamble, Cosmo?
Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
