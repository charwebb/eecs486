I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?
(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
In my mind, there's a war still going on.
Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!
(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
You can look for sneakers the next day!
The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)
(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
(anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?
