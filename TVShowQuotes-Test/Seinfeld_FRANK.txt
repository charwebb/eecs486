Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)
(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.
It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this.
You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
(leaving the kitchen) It's creative black tie. Move, woman.
You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.
Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.
A woman? What are you out of your mind?
I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
I don't think you did such a good job on these...
(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.
(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!
What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.
What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?"!!
