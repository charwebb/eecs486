Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...
(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!
George, open the door.
Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
That's your mother's new car.
Have you seen the pole, Kruger?
You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
Let's begin.
(Looks up) Where's that breeze coming from?
George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.
(grabbing the card) Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?
Hello, woman. (leaves)
No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
No! You never said milky white!
Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
This feels very comfortable.
(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)
Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?
Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.
You're not kidding it's a good move!
Your arm moves like this? (does the nudging motion)
George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
He said I was dead?
My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
The man on the tape wasn't specific.
Yeah, we worked it out.
I'm the father.
Read that poem.
C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.
Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
(leaving the kitchen) It's creative black tie. Move, woman.
What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!
(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?
They made a derogatory comment about me.
Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
I still say we're related.
That's it! You're grounded!
