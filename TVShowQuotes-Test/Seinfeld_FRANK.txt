How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.
Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.
I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.
(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.
He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.

I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
(on TV) You step on it and it flushes.
I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?" (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.
Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.
Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!
You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.
How hard could it be to kill this thing?
(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.
No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?
Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
You sayin' you want a piece of me?
Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
