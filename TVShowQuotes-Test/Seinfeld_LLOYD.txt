I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.
Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, "Hello".
You sure you don't want any yogurt?
Well, I'm really sorry I gotta run now. (sets down his cup of yogurt and makes his way out) Well, take it easy, huh, George?
You alright?
