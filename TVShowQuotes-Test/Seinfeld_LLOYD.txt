You alright?
How you doing?
I'll run in and get the gum.
Well, that's great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.
Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you.
Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here.
Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
