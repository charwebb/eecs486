Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. 
Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!
No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?
Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.
Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.
Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
You boys have been watching the "X-Files" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -
Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.
Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business. 
I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
