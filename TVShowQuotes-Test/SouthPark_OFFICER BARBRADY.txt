Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.
That is the silliest thing I've ever heard. 
You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt. 
Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.
Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef.
Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!
Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!
You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.
Hold it right there, cows!  Come back here! Now then!
