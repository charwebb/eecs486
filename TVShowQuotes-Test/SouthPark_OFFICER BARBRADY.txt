Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. 
You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt. 
Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now. 
I love to sing-a
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a
I love to sing-a
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...
All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.
No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you?
You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.
I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. 
Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! 
Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?
