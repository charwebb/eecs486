What do you mean?

Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. 

Why do you say that?

Oh God.

Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.

Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. 

Positive ID on the toilet paper. 

Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.

Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.

You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.

Hold it right there, cows!  Come back here! Now then! 

What? 

You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!

There you are!

There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.

Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle? 

That is the silliest thing I've ever heard.
