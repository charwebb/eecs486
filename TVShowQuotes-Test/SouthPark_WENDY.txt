Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!

You fucking suck so hard!!

I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.

And what is that?

Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!

Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. 

We'll march with you, Chef.

Oh. Hi, Stan.  I think it worked, Bebe.

Wwhat?

Mom, you don't-

Hi guys.

Hey, that's what I always do, too!

Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher.

That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!

How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?

Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.

No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you

I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!

See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far!  And if society won't fix it, I will!

Why would I be jel?

It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!

It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.

What?

You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!

I don't care! 

God! 

Hello?  My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."

Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.

How's it hanging'?

Hi, guys. 

Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list. 

Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!

Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut.  Slut.

Cheer Squad roll call! 

Cool! 

Cartman! 

Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs.

The South Park flag!

Aaah!

It's over. I give up. 

Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!

What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!

Ma'am?

I really don't care, Stan.

I don't think so! 

You're... back?

Hey, what about that?

Do you see what I'm talking about?

You can't bribe your way out of this!

Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.

Eww!

As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.

Hi, Stan.

Jelly school?

I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.

That's right.

No, I need help.

Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?!
