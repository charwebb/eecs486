Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.
I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this. 
I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise. 
This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-
Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.
Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.
Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!
It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!
I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? 
Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?
Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-
...And I was like, "I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars." 
Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover.
Why?!  Why are you doing this to me?!  Why won't you just stop?!
It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing.
Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!
Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. 
I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.
Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.
Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
Something that should have been done a long time ago!Â 
NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher.
Oh God, please don't let this be happening.
I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.
That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe.
