I think we went too far with Marjorine.
Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.
He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.
We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. 
Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.
Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!
I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend.
Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!
Many would rather die than go to those places!
Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!
Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?
Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.
You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!
Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!
Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!
So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.
Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?
You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!
Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!
And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,  and I've learned from it.  I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world.
It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!
Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! 
Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.
