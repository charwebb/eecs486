You mean, I should kiss him? 

Stan? Stan?!

That's okay.

Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-

The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the… the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-  ah…  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...

Eww! 

I want to see my egg.

Kaqemblaq! 

Oh, for Christ's sake!

Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. 

I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa.

Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.

It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.

Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. 

Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.

But Stan!

What?!

Hrmph!

That's okay, you guys. 

What's the matter, Kyle?

And I'm your captain, Wendy! 

Mmmm.

Yeah?

Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.

Hey guys. 

You knew!

What? What do you mean?

Hahaha.  Stan. Stan, wait up! 

You wanna dance? 

Slut.

Ah, what the hell. 

Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?

I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!

Stan? We need to talk about your locker.

Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?

Oh my God!

Noooo! Noooo!

Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?

I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.

Hi guys.

What?

Oh cool!

Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.

I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.

Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.

Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.

Wwhat?

I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 

Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.

What's going on?

Oh. Hi, Stan.  I think it worked, Bebe.

After school! We fight after school! You got that?!

Oh, coool!

He doesn't even know what he wrote about!

Eww!

I think we went too far with Marjorine.

Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!
