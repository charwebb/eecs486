You can't bribe your way out of this!
He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-
Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!
That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please?  Mr. Garrison?!
And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.
You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!  Bye, Ms. Ellen.
Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it.

Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.

I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.
Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.
So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.
Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? 
Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.
Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.
Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?
Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?
