Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!

Lemmiwinks has made it out and his tale is nearly through

Where the laulau is the kaukau at the luau
We throw our nets out into the sea
And all the ama-ama come swimmin' to me
Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
