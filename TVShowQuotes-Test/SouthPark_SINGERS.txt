Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Joseph Smith was called a prophet-
His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron.
Christmastime is once a year,
Every creature holds it dear,
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means the world to us all,
It's once a year, it's Christmastime,
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.
