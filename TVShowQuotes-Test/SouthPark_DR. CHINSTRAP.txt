What is it?!

Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... Light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. Float-  WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!

Alright, that does it.  Get your coat.

Hello, Freddy.  You're looking healthy.

The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?
