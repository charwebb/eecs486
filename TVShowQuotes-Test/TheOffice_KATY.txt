Okay, um, first, Legally Blond.
I'm gonna go back to my table.
Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
How are you?
You sit out there, don't you?
I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
[whispers] Sorry.
Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.
No...
