You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
I feel like I should be thanking you.
