Okay, great.
Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?
Hey Pam.
Okay.
Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
Jim.
Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?
Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
Do I need to?
Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
No.
What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
Okay.
We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
Yeah.
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?
Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
