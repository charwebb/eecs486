Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
Number two?
Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Oh, and Kelly...
I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?
It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
No, it is not.
Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?
Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm...
I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-
I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
Okay, let me know if you find it.
So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
No, no no no.  You're done, Michael.
What's that?
