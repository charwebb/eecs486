It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
I can't pretend I haven't seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can't take anything.

Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.

The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
