Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.

I love you.

Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!

Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.

AAAGGGHH!!!

Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"

Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!

Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? 

Your mother's made gahekgafuga.

Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.

Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next.

What was the agreement?

KYLE!

Yeah! ...Was that your leg?

Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.

Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.

So, so now we can't be friends?

And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.

Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. 

Randy. What happened?

Now, Kyle!

Oh yeah! blackjack table!

Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.

Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!

Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?

Sort of, yeah.

Oh. Sure. 

The answer is no, Kyle!

Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?

You didn't say not to tell anyone.

Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go! 

We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.

Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!

Huh?

Hello, everybody. Say, can I join in?

They're scared to death!

Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.

We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!

So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.

That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.

Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.

Whoops.

No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.

Isn't he responding at all, doctor?

And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em. 

UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.

Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!

Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 

That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.

Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!

Shh, shh! We've got the television working! 

Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!

Kyle, let me explain something to you.

I agree.

Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards.

But he has his mother's nose.

There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!

Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. 

Sheila, let me handle this.  Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!

Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!

Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--

You're so hot
