Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.
A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.
Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.
Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!
What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.
Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?
This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The worst thing!
Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?
Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?
What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.
She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.
Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down.
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.
Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?
So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. 
Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.
Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?
Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"
Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him? 
Oh God, is there nothing we can do?
And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. 
Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.
I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. 
Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.
All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
How long have you been on the cheese?!
There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!
