And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. 
Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?
We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.
Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.
Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.
Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! 
Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind. 
Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.
Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.
I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
How long have you been on the cheese?!
Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.
Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!
Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! 
Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.
That son of a bitch ripped my parka! 
Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.
I just don't get it.  Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The worst thing!
I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! 
Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'
That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off! 
Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.
