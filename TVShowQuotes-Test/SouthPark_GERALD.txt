All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.
We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.
Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!
First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?
Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? 
Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated.
Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! 
Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.
How long have you been on the cheese?!
I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.
Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?
Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?
She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!
I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-
And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.
Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. 
I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!
Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!
All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?
Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?
Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.
Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.
Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.
And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.
We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.
