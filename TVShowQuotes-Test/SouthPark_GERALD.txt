Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! 

Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.

If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.

She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.

Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?

Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 

Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!

Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 

Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.

Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.

Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.

Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.

Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...

Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind. 

No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!

There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.

Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.

So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. 

Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?

But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-

Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.

What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!

They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.

Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?

Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off.

Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.

That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?

Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!

Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before. 

We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.

You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!

That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.

It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus!
