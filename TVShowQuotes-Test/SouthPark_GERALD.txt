He was just here! Ike!

Come on, Kyle, we should get going!

But, what if you're not ready at 17?

Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?

Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?

This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!

Yeah! ...Was that your leg?

How about I put on the uniform?

Oh yeah! blackjack table!

...He might, Kyle.

Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!

We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.

Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.

I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.

Kyle!

We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  I'll get it. 

Please come home, Kyle. 
You left home lookin' for somethin' new. 
But all you need is right here waitin' for you 

You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl! 

Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?

Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!

Wow...

What?

Having a good time?

Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.

But he has his mother's nose.

Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?

You're having regrets, aren't you?

Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. 

Yes.

Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.

Yeah, I'm a big boy.

Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to  care about the earth!

I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski.

No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!

Well, this one is bigger!

Hey, what the heck is going on?

All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.

I love you.

God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." 

And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.

Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.

Sort of, yeah.

I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.

Your mother's made gahekgafuga.

Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!

From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.

Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.

Hey, it's a bear! 

Randy, where will you go?

You're too young for this stuff!

Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!

You're so hot

All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.

Oh no! Ohh!

Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.

That's not ridicul-

Oh yes there is! You could do it again!

Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.

What?!

Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.

Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.

Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!
