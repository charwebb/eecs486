No, you can't do that!

All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!

How's it goin', fat ass?

And then Token, and then me.

What the hell is wrong with these people?!

Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 

We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach

Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.

So?

Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.

Dude, what's the matter?

If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!

A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.

Yeah, yeah!

Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.

Again?

What do ya mean?

Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?

I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.

W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.

Oh, this is giving me a headache.

He said I have cynicism?

Hey!

Yes!

Dude, don't be nervous.

Yeah, you missed them turning around.

Jesus Christ, dude!

Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?

Yes, it is.

Cartman?

Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?

Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.

The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.

Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 

How do we do it?

There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.

Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?

Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!

I just turned 10.

Kyle!

No.

Hi, Uncle Jimbo.

I think he said his name is Marvin.

Enough! I know!

Mr. Garrison threw away his car?

Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.

What's a succubus?

Yeah!

No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!

Damn, Cartman!

And who do we have on our side?

Dude, I'm just learning.

Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 

What's so funny about that?

Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.

AAAAAAA! 

Wow, you guys really love animals.

AAAH! 

Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.

Maybe they found him out.

No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.

Holy crap! 

Holy fucking shit!

What's 'skylarkings'?

Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.

'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!

I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.

Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?

This is gonna be so sweet, dude.

Uh, crap..!

Yes?

Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!

That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.

Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!

Kore wa watashi no uchi desu. 

Go where?

What?

Then what are we going to do.

Oh God-dammit!

Wow, that sucks, dude.

I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.

What was that? 

No, dude, that doesn't make sense!

Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.

Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san.

We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.

Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.

Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.

Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!

Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.

Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?

Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. 

I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.

So what do we do now?

So then we can't sue him?

I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.

Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!

What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.

"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."

Yeah...

I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--

Did you ask the Vamp kids?

What?!

Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.

He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.

Dude, he's still not dead.

Well no, don't throw that out.

I saw him once. 

Go, go, go.

Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.

Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.

Sure dude.

Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.

That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 

Remember, "Truth" the first couple of times.

Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."

Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up! 

You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.

Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.

It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! 

Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!

Yeah?

Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.

That does it! I'm calling the police! 

Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 

There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.

W-we weren't scared!

No!

Yeah.

He's the record.

God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 

...No.

We must buy them all! 

Kyle??

Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.

Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!

You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.

Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.

Yeah, Cartman's pee.

Gay.

Yeah.

Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.

No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.

Shut up!

Yeah, well, so is your hat. 

Yeah.

Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.

Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!

Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.

Bleech!

Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.

Dude, they're gonna kill me.

Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.

Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 

I, I don't know. He seems all right.

It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.

What?!

What are we supposed to do with it?

And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 

Wow, cool!

What do you mean?

Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?

But we have to watch the commercials in this show.

Wait, it's not a real illness?

...Christmas is about something much more important!

Oh my God, they revived Gorak.

I think I'm going to name it Gorak.

...who are you people?!

We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!

What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.

I've gotta heal. 

Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.

Yeah, like ancient history.

Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!

No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!

Now, that's a get-well card! 

What??

You're... home. 

I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.

Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. 

Dude, he's incredible.

Come on, buddy, let's go! 

I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.

No not ham!

No way!

So?

Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.

Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!

Oh my God!

You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.

A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.

"So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"

Ready, you guys?

Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?

Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-

Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?

I can't believe they actually said it. 

We're metrosexual!!

Stop it.

Jesus Christ! 

Get the fuck out of here. 

No, you don't!  Dude!

Oh shit.

Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-

Forever.

We can stay. And fight.

Aw, man, if you have to.

No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.

I'm outta here; see ya guys. 

Weak!

Gee, what a concidence.

We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??

Ugh, Jesus Christ! 

I'll do it! I'll be in charge.

Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?

It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 

Let's have a cup o-Aaaa! 

Sshhh!

Oh! Here she comes.

She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.

The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-

So what does that mean?

Who are the corporations?

I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?

All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!

Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 

Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

...What, what was the question again?

That's all I needed. 

Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.

Oh boy oh boy.

Really?

Ahhhh!  Oh coool!

Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.

Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.

Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!

No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.

Now, Cartman! 

Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.

Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!

Did you like the old one?

Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.

Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.

But can he still ride a bull?

Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.

Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?

Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!

That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! 

Hey! We've landed in ice cream!

If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?

Dude, what the hell was that?

Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.

NO!

Oh...

Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?

What the fuck?

What?!

Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places! 

It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.

Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.

Uh huh.

That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.

Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.

'Kay, come on guys. 

It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.

Well?

Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 

Dude, fuck you!

Hey there, little guy.

What a bitch!

No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.

We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

All right!

Aw dude, I clocked you!

He's doomed.

Wow, that's cool!

NO!!

Uh-oh.

Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.

Sweet! 

What's that?

Oooh.

Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.

Wait a minute. There they are!

No wait.

Thanks.

Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. 

Let me see.

You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!

I'll live with you.

My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.

Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!

Hey, Cartman!

Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.

You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.

Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.

Oh, weak. 

Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Fine.

I know, a-and look. 

Now what do we do?

Dude, I think it's Saturday now.

I wanna return this Margaritaville.

Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?

Kyle, we all agreed to do this!

What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!

It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 

Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang" mean, anyways?

He just showed up here.

Oh.

Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?

What?

Chef, what's a prostitute?

But MOM!

Yeah.

Boy band?

They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.

Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.

Aw crap!

What???

I will Big Gay Al, I will. 

We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!

Cartman!

Huh?

Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!

We don't know anything about animation.

Yeah, dude. It's right over there.

I think I understand.

Eh hey, could you tell me how I-

Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!

Goddamnit Cartman, what?! 

NO.

Mom...  Dad, it was just a-

His plan was to use a hammer.

We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?

Dude, it's our dads.

Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.

Are you serious?

Yeah.

Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.

No, no-no-no.

Goddamnit, that pissed me off!

But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 

Why?! What's the big deal?!

Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!

Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.

Yeah.

That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 

Dude! Visitors!

His name is Gorak!

I...

Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 

Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?

Hello?

Grandpa? 

Yahtzee. 

Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?

What?!

And we're... cut! &gt;&gt; /&gt;/&gt;

Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!

This is Nebraska?

Red rocket, red rocket!

SNAAAKE! 

Well, sure we can.

Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.

Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.

Aw, dude, this looks like shit.

No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 

Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?

Dude!

Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 

Whoa, dude!

All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.

Dude!

Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet

What are you doing grampa?

Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

Huh?

Okay.

Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?

I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.

Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.

Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas

One-two-three, not it!

Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!

Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?

No, Towelie, the entry code!

Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?

No.

It does?

I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 

Dad, weren't you watching?

I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! 

So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.

Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?

...What?!

Mr. Garrison?

Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.

Mph. 

Whooping Fart Balls.

What's the scariest thing we could get?

Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?

Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.

We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.

Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.

It's just...

This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.

No, I don't think either of us can. 

I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.

But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.

Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.

You got it!

Right now, goddamnit!

Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 

...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

...Sorry.

Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 

Oh, neither.  It's my sister.

I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!

Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!

It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.

For what?

69ingchipmunks@me.com 

Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 

We know, we know, that's what everybody says.

We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.

Hoh! 

Excuse me?

Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 

Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.

You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 

Kill the alien?

This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.

I'll try

Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.

It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!

No, you can't possibly mean that-!

Yeah, mung.

Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.

Okay, hold it, hold it. 

Yeah. 

Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?

Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!

And a chef hat.

Shut up, Cartman.

What do we want?

Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!

We committed him.

If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 

Nnnaaargh!

They deserve it for lying to us, dude.

Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!

What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!

L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.

Kenny says that's not what it means.

I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 

Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..

Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.

Yes, we're here.

We don't wanna see them, Cartman! 

You're Chef's parents?

What I started? How dare you!

We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.

Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 

Dad, get off our teamspeak line!

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.

But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-

Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.

This is sooo embarrassing.

Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.

Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!

Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.

What are we gonna do with them?

Yeah, that's basically it.

You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.

"Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that even mean?!

I won't say a word.

We're just going in to get our video game back.

We want Sexual Harassment Panda.

Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 

Hell yeah! 

I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.

Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!

No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.

Hey, he's coming towards us.

It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!

Oh my God, they've killed--

The whole thing is a joke!

...What do you know about the leprechaun?

But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!

She's not my girlfriend.

We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?

Dare.

Dude!

Sweet!

Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.

Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.

Jesus Christ!

Noo problem!

What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.

Good luck, Bulrog. 

That would be best.

All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.

Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.

Eight fifty one.

It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 

OK, whenever you're ready.

Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.

We believe in you, Fonz.

Ugh.

What the..? 

What?

Lubricated Titty Burgers.

So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song

Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!

Yeah...

As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 

Sorry.

Chef, what's a prostitute?

Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.

Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?

Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 

What happened??

Wait, where are we going?

Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 

Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 

Yeah, what are you? A child molester?

Awww God! 

Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?

Don't let him get away!

Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?

Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.

What?

Ahta. Ah, ahta!

Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!

Whoa, dude!

Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?

...What?

We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!

I have no idea. 

Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.

You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!

A-ah huh.

Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.

...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?

Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 

Cartman, where are you going?? 

Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?

Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!

What are you guys doing out here?

Huh? What, uh?

Back in the third grade.

All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.

We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!

Man, it's hot out here.

You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!

...212, 213, 214 members!

The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.

Less than 20 minutes?!

Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.

Butters, come out here.

Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.

Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.

Aaah!! 

No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.

What time is it?

But, how do they get away with that?

Jesus, dude! 

Uh, we didn't do it.

You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.

Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?

We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.

Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 

Yeah, who cares?

Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.

Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!

Let's get out of here!

Get near the puck! 

How can we raise awareness?

Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?

What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!

What?! 

Run, dude, run!!

...Why?

You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!

Ohh, it all makes sense now. 

Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.

We don't know.

Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!

He's looking at the sign.

What?

Nan da kore? 

...so?

The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?

You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 

Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.

Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.

But dude-

I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.

There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.

This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.

Whoa, cool!

That's not what the Harrisons said.

Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.

I can't believe that fat asshole!

Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!

But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? 

I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.

DAD!

You really think so?

I didn't even think about that.

What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?

(Dude!)

They're gonna chop off his wee wee! 

...Nnnno, there isn't. 

We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.

Oh, thank God.

Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! 

If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?

We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.

Come on, guys! 

Yahtzee?

Yeah.

How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!

Cartman, stop it!

Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.

Come on! This stupid light won't change.

Agggghhh! 

Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?

What?

Why?

Dad, let's just wait our turn.

Hm.

No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.

How much do we get if we work for you?

What's a dildo, Kenny?

But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.

This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.

Dude, that's not cool.

Oh, hey Kenny.

Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.

The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.

Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 

Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!

Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.

It was seriously almost hard to watch. 

Oh-h. Nowhere. 

Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.

What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.

God-damnit, this is ridiculous.

See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!

Damnit!

Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.

Bluuch. 

Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.

Okay, come on. 

That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.

Wait, you have guns here?

We told you that.

Well this time he's gone too far!

Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--

Admit it was our fault?

Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.

I don't care! We're going!

Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...

But where's Phillip?

We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 

Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?

When are they gonna make new ones?

Ho! 

Good night grampa.

How's it going, Cartman?

...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!

Yeah?

Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.

Here we go. 

Damn!

Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.

We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 

There's nothing here, Kyle. 

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 

Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...

Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!

What happened?

Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. 

What the hell?

Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.

...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.

Cartman?

Does this month, November, hold a special significance?

Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.

Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.

Who?

We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 

Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?

Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?

Fine! 

This is bullcrap, dude!

Huh-I dunno.

Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?

So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 

But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.

But he is-

Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.

So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?

Yeah, pretty sure.

Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.

Thanks. 

He's right.

They are trying to save Clyde's mom.

Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.

Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.

Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!

Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!

Hay, you're that band KoRn.

We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.

It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.

Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!

Blanket, you in here?

That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.

Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 

Have I missed anything?

No.

That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.

What?

Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...

'K, let's put him on here. 

Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!

Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.

Holy crap, dude.

Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!

You were great, Dad.

We're in!

Help ...him?

I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.

Hello?

Awgh!  Oh thank God.

Hey Craig.

Have you reported this to any other authorities?

I asked you guys to help me and you said no!

For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!

Bluuch! I'd love to. 

Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!

Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!

Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.

That is our understanding.

Fine!

Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.

Hey Dad.

We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.

No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.

Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!

He's such a douchebag

Yeess, this stuff rocks!

Let's go!

I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.

Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.

So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?

Good morning, Miss Crabtree.

Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
