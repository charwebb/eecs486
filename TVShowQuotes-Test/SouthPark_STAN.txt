No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 
...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. 
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.
I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 
Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 
He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!
Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. 
Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
I know, but there's nothing I can do.
Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 
Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. 
We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! 
Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 
Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-
But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. 
Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies.Â 
But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 
Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. 
Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet
Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 
Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.
You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
This says "maximum."  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! 
Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. 
Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 
What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know thatâ¦that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 
No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.
Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!
Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 
We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? 
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 
We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
â¦So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 
Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
I know we can lose if we try.
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan.Â 
What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- 
Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 
I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 
Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
And who do we have on our side?
We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.
Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
Dude, we we have to go check this out.
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan 
Because I had an itch up my ass.
I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 
Right, so how do we get back at them?
Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
Dude, do you really have to do it?
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!
Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
I have to give him half my stuff?
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.
Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?
Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?
