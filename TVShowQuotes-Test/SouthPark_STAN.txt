You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 
Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
My parents will never let me keep a goat
You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
We have come to reclaim the one tape! 
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. 
My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 
That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 
Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 
Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 
Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 
"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?
Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 
No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 
No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 
Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
I can't. I was banished for not voting.
I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!
No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
And she's at a hotel in our town. 
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 
What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 
Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 
All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.
But I don't know any of this stuff.
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 
Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
Well why did you have to involve me??
Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 
Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 
Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 
Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."
You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
What the hell do you want from me?! 
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
I took them to see how abortions are done.
Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 
Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 
I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
Jesus... we have to get out of here. 
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 
Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
We might pass him off as our pet.
Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 
So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.
Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!
This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! 
Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
So, so then, so then the pope says, "Maybe you should go check the toilet." 
We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
I don't believe that he's my future self!
Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.
You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.
Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 
It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 
Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 
Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 
I have a button we can use for his nose.
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
Did you hear anything more about what happened?
Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?
We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
