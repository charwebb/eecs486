Kyle!

Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!

JESUS CHRIST!!

Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.

Hit A and X together.

Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! 

I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!

The Chosen One?

Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 

Come on, Kenny, hurry up!

Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!

Where's he?

We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.

I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.

Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!

And it's okay to be gay! 

I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.

Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 

Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!

Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.

What's that you're wearing?

Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 

Do you think he can ride the bull?

My family's dead! 

Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?

Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!

Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 

Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?

We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.

We wanted to see an alien planet or something.

Our planet is just a reality-TV show?

Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!

Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!

What?

What are you doing, Cartman?

Hello?

No, I don't think either of us can. 

I'm tired, Grandpa.

Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?

...Oh that makes sense.

Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.

No! I have to get it out!

Just put it between his eyes.

What is this all about, Kyle?

Hey Kenny

Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.

I don't know.  Whoa. 

Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.

The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.

What ride?

We're on the case.

It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.

They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 

Dude, I don't understand this game at all.

But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.

"That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" 

Aughah. 

Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...

I have no idea what you're talking about.

This rocket will fly to the moon?

Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.

Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 

No thanks.

Stan.

You bastards!

There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.

They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!

Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!

Aww crap.

Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.

No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.

Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?

Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.

South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!

Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!

Gee, what a concidence.

No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.

Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.

...well but... but that's my money.

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.

It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.

There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.

What's that stuff?

Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 

Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.

We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 

Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!

That's a cool idea

That's it! Hurry! Gooo! 

Shut up, Cartman!

Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.

No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?

If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!

Awesome!

Cartman isn't our friend anymore. 

Mr. Garrison, stop!

Hey dude.

Dude, what's the big deal?

Hey, what are you guys doing here?

Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 

No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.

Yhh, yeah, the first grader?

Have you confessed all your sins yet?

Damnit!

That's such a great paper! 

Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?

Yeah, dude, it's all yours.

Dude, did you do all your homework last night?

What's the big idea, Craig?!

Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.

We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?

Huh-I dunno.

Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?"  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 

Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.

Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.

Wow!

Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-

Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.

Brake, Kenny, brake. 

No...

What I started? How dare you!

Hey, kid, what are you doing?

Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.

Huh?

Oh, not Tweek.

Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 

All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?

Whoa whoa wait, wait! 

Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.

Hooray!

Dude, I'm just learning.

You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! 

He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.

Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.

Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 

Oh crap, dude!

Crap!

I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.

Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!

Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 

Uh, yyeah.

Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.

Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!

I can't believe they won't ban our book!

Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."

Can I do it?

Where?

So throw it away.

Oh, never mind. 

Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?

God-damnit!

Ready? 1-2-3-4. 

Dude, the two male judges love her.

Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!

When are they gonna make new ones?

Son of a bitch! 

Oh, it's just a goat. 

I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. 

Whoa.

You mean like a baker and a cop?

What?

If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.

Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.

Yup.

Russian?

Yeah. I told you that!

Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.

Alright, here we go.

Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.

So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.

NO! 

Dad. Dad! 

Gah, let's go you guys. 

Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!

I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.

You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.

A what?

Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?

No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.

...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 

Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 

Bluuuch 

Aw, man, if you have to.

Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 

Come on Cartman!

So?

Damn, dude. China's fucked up.

He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 

Don't be a smartass?

Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!

You all right?

I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.

Dude, do you really have to do it?

I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.

Yeah, who cares?

That's okay with us.

Neither did I!

Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.

Who's that?

Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 

We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.

What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.

But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.

Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.

I have no idea. 

Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.

Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?

Where'd he go? 

I didn't know.

What's going on?

Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!

Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?

When do we want it?

What?

Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!

Ummm, where did you get that picture?

Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.

Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 

'K 

Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.

What?

Chef, we're hungry.

Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay? 

Yeah, well, so is your hat. 

So?

Oh my God... They killed Chef.

That's worse!

Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?

He doesn't look very happy in there.

She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.

No more Chef.

Yeah-

Why oh oh?

Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 

I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.

Well, we don't take kindly to you!

Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.

Dude, we are in so much trouble!

We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.

Yeah, haha.

Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?

She's stealing Chef from us.

It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 

Really?

Ready. Let's see 'em.

The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!

Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!

We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.

Yeah, you missed them turning around.

I'm gotta get outta here!

Why?! What's the big deal?!

Mr. Mackey, stop running!

Come on, dude. Hurry.

Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 

Oh thanks, dude.

Hurry up, stupid parachute!

Jesus Christ! 

Aw crap!

I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.

Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.

Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.

Come on you guys, I have an idea.

Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?

I know! 

Eight fifty one.

Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!

Yeah.

We made it.

Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!

...What?

God this sucks!

Oh jeez, change the channel.

Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.

Wait, where are we going?

So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?

Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 

What's going on? 

Mom!

We're here! It's the water park! 

Kyle!

Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.

You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.

...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...

God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!

Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!

What?! 

It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.

Yeah, let us go!

Oh, that's a good idea.

Kyle! Du-what is going on?!

It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.

You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! 

Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.

I have no idea.

Jesus, why does God hate me?

D'you have lots of gay dogs here?

Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?

Cartman!

AAAAAAA! 

Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?

No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!

How do you feel, Butters?

Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?

Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.

Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.

No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"

Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 

Agh.

Chef!

My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.

Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!

Dude, it's over. He's gone.

Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 

Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?

Kyle, maybe this is for real.

What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.

Do you think animals can be murderers, too?

I know! Let's go sledding!

Alright, go Cartman.

Sick dude, she's my sister.

But I don't understand why we have to--

Hey, what are you doing?! 

Come on, Cartman. 

Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.

This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.

No, dad! We need your keys!

Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 

Whatcha doin'?

No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.

You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!

Two hundred dollars.

Well there could still be a god.

Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!

Yeah. Let's play ball.

Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.

Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.

Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.

Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.

You were great, Dad.

Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.

Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.

Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.

Yeah, you damn kids!

Kyle! 

Ahah

Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?

Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.

So where's the other doctor? 

Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!

Who's the Coon?

Okay, come on. 

He's not meaner than Sparky.

Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.

But why?

Alright, alright, here. 

I'll try again.

What's this? 

Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!

Okay, I'm sorry!

What?!

You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!

No.

Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?

But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?

Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!

You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!

Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.

Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.

Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?

Dude, have you lost more weight?

We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 

Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!

Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.

Dude.

I already lost all my baby teeth.

What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?

Ohhhhhhh.

Grampa!! 

Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.

This is gonna be so funny!

How do we write he note, Cartman?

Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...

Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!

Well, I can hardly wait.

That was beautiful, dude.

What happened?

Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. 

You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.

Would you mind stepping back a little?

We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!

What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.

I know, but uh-... but...

How 'bout some ice cream?

No, because I really want you to kill yourself.

He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.

Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.

Dad, isn't this a little extreme?

We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?

Cartman, calm down!

Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? 

Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?

Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--

All right Jesus!

As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 

Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."

Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?

KYLE!! 

Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.

Tralalalala

Shhh!

Cartman, dude, what's wrong?

I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.

Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.

Where? I can't see.

I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.

What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?

You said we're free to leave whenever we want

Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.

He said, "hi."

(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!

Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!

Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.

...What?!

Dude!

Butters, you're the one doing all this?

Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.

Hey, Chef.

W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?

Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.

But I thought you meant the Son of God!

What's "The Contender"?

Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.

Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.

Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.

Dude, I hate my family. 

Bad.

I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.

Goddammit!

I'll throw in five.

How about Token? 

Ah our client has an audition to this show.

Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?

I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.

Yeah, it was weak.

Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.

All right, our client will do it!

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san.

Dude.

Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-

Let go of my face, asshole!

All right, can you explain to me what's going on?

Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.

That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.

Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!

Yeah, it's fun.

Dude.

Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!

Ready, you guys?

No, I never have.

Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!

No, you can't possibly mean that-!

Dude, it's the freak nurse!

Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! 

Son of a bitch!

We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??

Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Hey, back off!

Whoa, dude!

You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.

Dad, nobody's gonna come.

We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!

There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!

Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.

We brought Christmas to Iraq!

Dude, shut up!

Just get across the river! They're coming! 

What, dude? 

Yeah, my goldfish-.

How's he doing?

No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!

We believe in you, Fonz.

Uh, hey Dad.

Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)

Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.

Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.

Yeah.

Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!

I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!

Oh no.

What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!

Do you think they're happy?

I don't want to go to this stupid party!

Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.

No he's not.  Is he?

Yes I do.

Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!

I- 

Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 

Come on, let's get it a try. 

Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 

Right, so, why do we color eggs? 

Butters?

Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 

Just for a minute. Over here. 

Sure, whatever dude.

You big piece of crap!

Dad, what are you doing?

We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!

Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?

What?

Where's dad?

His... name... is... Gorak!

I'll kick your ass, Kyle!

Is this for real?? This is for real!

No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.

I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!

There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.

What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!

Yeah? 

You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?

It is?? 

Aw, dude, why would they do that?

Let's go! 

Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.

Run for it!

Hawaii?

What??

E mouths...

I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.

Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.

Wow!

Wull, maybe he won't fight.

Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??

Oh, then, what's Halloween about?

Dude, Cartman.

You're not number two!

Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.

The dragon. Where did it go?

Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.

Here you go.

I don't know. He's such a wuss.

What the hell does that mean?

You did? 

Pretty good. We're almost done.

What happened?

We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 

It's Cartman!

Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.

Me?! Did you see that shit?!

I really like that guy.

Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!

Hey it looks different.

Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?

Jesus Christ!!!

We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.

Wow! 

Good luck. 

That's great.

You're... home. 

Sick, dude.

What? 

Commercial Break Number Two! 

Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.

They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?

Is the whole government in on this?

Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 

Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"

Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!

Is he doing it again?

Kyle, you can't kill yourself!

I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.

Aw, hell!

Aw- awwww!

Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! 

No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.

Cartman, wake up!

Hey, fat ass.

Oh, God, it's horrible! 

You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.

Dammit, we lost one already!

Dad?  Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!

Hm. Guess he got what he deserved. 

What you assholes acted like you were doing? 

Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!

Yeah.

Dad!

Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 

But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.

Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!

Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?

We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!

Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.

Gee, thanks!

What's a dildo?

No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.

Dammit! I just want it to snow again!

Ooooogh.

Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.

All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.

Nnnaaargh!

Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 

No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.

Sparky, bad dog!

There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.

Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!

Puff Daddy?

How the hell should we know? 

Okay.

Excuse me!

Wow, that sucks, dude.

What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!

I donnow, just keep rolling.

No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"!  "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed!  "Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! 

Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.

What's going on??

So dude, did Cartman's idea work?

We could?

You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!

We'd love them!

Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?

Oh, phew.

I've gotta heal. 

Tell them to get away now!

Yeah?

To the bathroom?

Washington Redskins.  I like it!

Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!

Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.

Mr. Mackey.

Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! 

No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!

The list was a forgery, Kyle!

We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.

It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.

It fell;

No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.

'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?

'K.

Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.

But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.

Hello?

Why did they have us put on long underwear.

Did you bring the camera?

See you around, dude. 

What do we want?

Oh my God!

That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?

Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!

It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!

Oh,. God. 

True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.

God dammit!

...No, I don't care about the show.

Yeah!

Hey Kyle.

Uh, it... sucks ass.

Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.

Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...

Don't touch me. 

How can they even call that a movie?

We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.

Yeah, Cartman told us.

Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.

Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 

We, we got it. 

Alright, so where is it?

They have nowhere else to go.  Please?

Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.

And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!

Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!

Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.

Sure was, Dad.

Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 

No.  Screw this, dude. 

Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.

Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.

Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!

Bad.

No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!

Where'd you get those?

We've gotta find that ticket!

Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?

Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.

Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.

So what should we do? 

Yeah.

I don't?

Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 

Indiana Jones! All right! 

Oh God, you guys, really? This again? 

Aaah!

Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!

We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 

Where are you going?

Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.

Does this mean we don't have school all week?

Can you speak in present-day English please?

Excuse me?

This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!

Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 

Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 

Oh crap, the gingers!

Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!

A little more gas, Kenny. 

Two hours.

Fine, how are you?

Hooray! 

This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.

Well, who didn't see that coming?

Oh, no! They got Chef, too!

You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?

Grandpa? 

You suck, Cartman!

...Sorry.

No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.

Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. 

You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 

Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.

Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?

Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?

We're rich?

And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.

Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.

Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!

You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.

Ohh, it all makes sense now. 

Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...

Wow! So you'll help him?

Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!

Thank God. 

I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.

We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.

But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!

Dude, where have you been?

Naw, I'm with Wendy.

Amazing.

Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? 

You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!

Kyle? Kyle!

Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!

Aw man! 

There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.

You had head lice?

What about San Francisco?

Chef, we just got served.

What?

Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.

I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.

Bad.

What?

Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.

Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!

Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.

Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.

Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?

I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.

Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!

Well why did you have to involve me??

Hey assholes! 

What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?

But what can I do?

It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. 

You?

Yup.

Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
