Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!
Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 
Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
I have a button we can use for his nose.
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!
Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 
Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.
Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.
Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?
Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? 
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.
We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 
Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 
Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.
Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 
...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
How do you guys make them so yummy?
Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
I don't know what the hell that is...
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 
Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 
Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. 
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!
Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.
I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.
Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!
We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.
Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 
They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?
Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
What are we supposed to do with it?
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.
You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 
You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on! 
No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.
Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? 
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
"Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that even mean?!
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 
But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
What do you think happens if you do have it?
Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?
I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan 
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. 
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 
Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 
It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!
Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.
Help me chip some of the ice away.
Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 
Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. 
Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! 
Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
Where do handicapped people go when they die?
Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
I can't. I was banished for not voting.
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
I took them to see how abortions are done.
If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 
Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
What the hell do you want from me?! 
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. 
It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
