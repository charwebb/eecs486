But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!
Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
Not that. Did you actually go to that?
Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!
Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 
I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!
Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.
Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!
We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 
I think he said his name is Marvin.
They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 
Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 
Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
My parents will never let me keep a goat
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
No! We won't let you destroy our town!
...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 
Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 
W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? 
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 
You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
Well, at least you got it out of your system.
I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?
Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 
Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 
Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! 
This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.
The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
...and then we put them back in the tank.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" 
Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."
Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! 
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Something I should have done a long time ago. 
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 
Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 
Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?
Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
"Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"
No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
How are we supposed to give them to you?
Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. 
Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 
Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 
Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.
...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.
Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.
Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.
Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? 
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.
Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. 
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
Ah our client has an audition to this show.
NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! 
Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.
