We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 
You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 
Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 
But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 
Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
"Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that even mean?!
Well, at least you got it out of your system.
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 
For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!
Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. 
Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 
Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 
W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.
Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 
Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
What are you going to do with it, dude?
All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. 
Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
This says "maximum."  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac
We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. 
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? 
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 
Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. 
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.
Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. 
I think he said his name is Marvin.
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 
All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.
This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 
Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 
Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. 
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.
Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! 
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.
Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! 
Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. 
Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. 
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 
Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.
I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! 
Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 
All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?
Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 
If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
You said we're free to leave whenever we want
Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
What you assholes acted like you were doing? 
Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 
And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!
Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 
Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
All right, let's get the hell out of here! 
Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 
I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 
A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
