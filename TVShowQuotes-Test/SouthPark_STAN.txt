Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.

All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.

Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.

Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.

Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.

I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!

Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.

And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,

It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.

Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.

Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 

Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!

...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.

Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.

Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.

Aw dude, I need to go to bed.

Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.

You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!

We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.

Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.

These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!

Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.

Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.

Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 

Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.

That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!

Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.

Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!

This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!

Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.

We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?

No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.

I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.

Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!

No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!

Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.

I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.

...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.

There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 

Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 

Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.

Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.

We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now

What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!

Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--

This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.

Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?

Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 

Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.

Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.

No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!

So I can return it to a bank?

Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.

We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.

Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?

And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" 

Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!

Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 

Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.

Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 

Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!

I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!

Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.

We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.

Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.

So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.

Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.

Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.

Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!

That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.

We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 

Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.

Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.

Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-

No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!

You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.

Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.

Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?

Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.

This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!

I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!

Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?

Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.

Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!

But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!

Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!

But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.

God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 

Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.

Something I should have done a long time ago. 

So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!

Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!

We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.

I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!

Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 

I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.

Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.

Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?

You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!

Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!

I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.

Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!

Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!

If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!

We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.

You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?

Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!

Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??

Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.

Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 

Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!

Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?

I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.

We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!

W-what did you get in a fight about?

Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?

Is this for real?? This is for real!

Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.

An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.

Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?

We're just going in to get our video game back.

Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.

It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.

Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.

Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 

Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-

Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?

There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.

Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.

Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.

Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.

Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!

We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.

I know we can lose if we try.

Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 

Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.

Hey! So what are you going to do now?

I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 

You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!

You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.

Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.

But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.

Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.

We all have to do this report together, dude.

It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!

Well you have to convince them they are real!

What the hell kind of flowers are those?

I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.

They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?

No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!

Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.

We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.

Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.

No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.

Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.

Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!

Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.

Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?

The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.

It's not gonna work; just come down from there.

It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 

But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.

Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.

The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.

Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.

That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.

Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 

I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.

But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.

Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?

Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...

Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 

Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 

Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.

So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 

All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.

No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.

Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 

How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.

Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?

Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 

Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.

Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?

Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 

Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!

There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 

Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. 

First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!

Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?

That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.

'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.

Pick me up. I... I want to see. 

That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?

We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.

Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?

I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.

It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.

Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.

It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.

I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.

Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?

Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?

Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.

I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!

And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?

Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.

No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 

Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.

Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!
No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.

Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.

And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.

Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.

Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.

Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-

Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.

Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.

Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 

He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 

Dude, he did that to me this morning.

I think he said his name is Marvin.

Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.

No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.

My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.

We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.

The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.

I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.

Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 

Well, you might as well let it go.

Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.

Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?

Butters, is there any way out of here?

Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!

Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-

All right, sorry guys. So where to now?

Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls

Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 

What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 

Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.

Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!

You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!

My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.

Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?

It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!

You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!

But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?

What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.

You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 

Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!

They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!

Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!

Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?

No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.

Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 

Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 

Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!

That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.

Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.

I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.

Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.

Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?

Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.

Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.

Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 

I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.

Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!

Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?

Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.

Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.

No! We won't let you destroy our town!

Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!

Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.

He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-

Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.

Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.

Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.

Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.

I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.

They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?

No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!

Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.

Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.

He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.

My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.

The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.

Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.

Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.

We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!

Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.

He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.

Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.

Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.

My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.

We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.

I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!

Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 

Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?

Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?

What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.

Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. 

Two four nine all right, this is the place.

Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?

So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?

Jesus... we have to get out of here. 

No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!

Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.

Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.

Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.

It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.

The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?

You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?

The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.

What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!

Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 

Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 

Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-

Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?

Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.

You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?

No, I seriously don't want any more friends.

Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.

Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!

Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.

I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.

I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.

Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.

Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger

No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.

Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.

Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??

Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.

Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.

I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.

Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?

Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??

Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
