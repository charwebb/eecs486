This is Michael with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?

What? Where are you tay- No! NO!!  What the hell?? ...Oh my God.  Get me out of here! Let me go!

No! You've gotta listen to me! You don't know what you're doing!!  You fucking conformists!  They're evillll!

Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.

I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.

Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains.

No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like "I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world" and I was like "No waaay!" and she was like "Yeah, soon it will be too late." and I was all "No waaay!"

Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this.  Keanu Reeves' statue.  Congratulations. 

Yeah.  The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette. 

Oh my God it's worse than we thought! They made her emo!

Small white ones, yes ma'am.  Standard or voice assist model?
