What the...? 

Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!

No.  What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo!

Allison Merch is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.

Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains.

Oh my God it's worse than we thought! They made her emo!

Yup.

Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends. 

Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate?  I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they knew what they were doing.

Right, sorry.

Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change.
We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts'
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays
And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.
Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!

Dude, we need a girl.

So we're back to that, are we?

It's worse thann we thought.

Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me?

Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this.  Keanu Reeves' statue.  Congratulations. 

So lame! Why doesn't everyone just die?!

That's great. And I understand this is somebody's first AA meeting, is that right? &lt;/&gt; Y-yes, you sir. Stand on up and introduce yourself.
