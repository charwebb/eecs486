Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?
Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.
(aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.
(to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. Shes a masseuse!
