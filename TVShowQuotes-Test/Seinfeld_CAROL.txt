Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?
So how do you think she looks like?
Oh! I have pictures!
Oh, just look at him!
Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
No, nothing here, lets go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.
