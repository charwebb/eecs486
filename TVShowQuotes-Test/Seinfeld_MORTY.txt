That's right. My son bought it for me.
How the hell do you work this thing?

My idiot son could open that garage door.
(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.

Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.

What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
