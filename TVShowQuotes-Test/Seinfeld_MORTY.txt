What was that?
Well, go up to the office.
(cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer!
Hello, Jerry? It's your father.
Who needs this?
Why should I be comfortable?
I'd have to go back to work.
What?
(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
I'll get a book.
Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
But it comes on 1130.
Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
Here, I got it.
Always, Jerry. Always.
I did so thank him!
Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
(to Jerry) Can you believe this?!
Whats the matter? You need a lawyer?
Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?
And its always about Jeffrey, right?
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
What the hell are you doing here?
Wrap it up, we'll take it home.
How long they been doing this?
Buh bye Elaine
No, we just came for the funeral. `
(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
What for?
Did you have a coke or what?
You ever see one so nice?
Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
There she is.
Uh huh.
We can't stand them.
Don't worry about it.
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
Are you getting that?
A present?
He's wearing one.
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
If they get the votes.
You know what the flight backll cost us?
Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
Hey guys . Jerry . Kramer
I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
