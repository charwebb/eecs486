(laughs) Heh hah!
Hello?
You shoulda told me it didn't work.
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
You sell clothes here, don't you?
What do you want?
(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.
Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
I thought you forgot about me.
Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
You think it's hot?
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
What's the difference, we'll figure something out.
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
Well, we just bought a new place down there.
Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
Whats wrong with it?
I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
We'll see.
Why should I be comfortable?
You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
That's right. My son bought it for me.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
(cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer!
Ah, he's deaf anyway.
Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
Are you kidding? They built the lake.
Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular.
Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
I retract your retraction.
Leave all my stuff here?
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
Oh, it's George.
The whole movie was in black and white.
You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
