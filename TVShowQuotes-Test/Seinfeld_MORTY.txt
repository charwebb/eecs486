You just heard about this today?
Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
How're your folks?
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
Oh, it's George.
Astronaut!
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
Hello?
They give you that *Fish.*
Always, Jerry. Always.
What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
This is it.
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
Hey, Jerry.
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding.
All right. Make it 20 bucks.
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
Jack have some spong cake.
(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
What are you talking? We use it.
(to Jerry) Can you believe this?!
What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
What are you, nuts?
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
I'll get a book.
You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? -) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
Astronaut?
Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
We'll see.
We'll round down.
That's right. They went like hotcakes.
Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
Plus the insurance.
How about Loni Anderson?
Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
What did you say?
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
So much the better.
I got my sport jacket.
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.
Could you believe that guy?
