He'll send them express.
What did you say?
I'm paying.
Are you ready for dessert?
What for?
Astronaut?
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
Where do you come off with this crap?
You don't think it's fair.

Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?

So, how did she find out?
So bring a snack-pack.
Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
His pen.

You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
You think it's hot?
Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
I'm thinking more like fifteen.
He could wash them.
Well we do.
What're you talking about?
Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
Jerry!
I thought you forgot about me.
How long they been doing this?
You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
You got enough here for a life sentence.
Buh bye Elaine
