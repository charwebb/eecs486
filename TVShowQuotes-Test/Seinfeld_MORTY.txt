First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?

(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!
Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
