Then come on! 

You! HATER!

Yeah.

Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great.

Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!

If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! 

Oh cool! It worked!

I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?

God, you're so stupid! 

Her feathers are beautiful.

Hey Wendy, how's your egg doing?

Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate.

Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.  Okay, Clyde, we can go now.

After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad! 

Can we try this without Wendy?

We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.

Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. 

Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! 

That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!

Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?  Stan, Truth or Dare?

Token likes Nichole?

Thanks, Annie!
