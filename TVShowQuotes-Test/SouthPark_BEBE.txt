Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.
Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?
Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina.
Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.

Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, "sexual tension." Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.
