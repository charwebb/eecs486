Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
I can always kind of win at roulette.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
Well we are here now, so let's just--
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
I think you should do it. That's great!
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
