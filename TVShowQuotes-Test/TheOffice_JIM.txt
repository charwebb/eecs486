Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
[claps] All right.
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
No, I'm not making bread.
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.
No, I...
Um. He sticks to his guns.
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
I know.
Smart.
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Yeah, yeah.
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
And... ta da.
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
Hey Kelly. What's up?
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
We should take a look at those surveys.
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
Come on Dwight! Use words.
Who else we got?
Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?
Oh, thanks man.
Fantastic.
Whoa, careful, careful.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
See you.
[answers cell phone] Hey!
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
All right.
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Really? You just agreed to that?
Oh you did?
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
Which one's this? Perfect.
[flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH!
What?
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
No I'm not drunk.  Are you drunk?
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
No. No. Definitely. It's ..
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
I know. It's very cute.
Right back at ya.
[shaking hands] How are ya?
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
So, where did you learn how to play?
Yeah.
Andy, come on.
There's a table over here.
Yep.
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
Sometime today.
Is that off again?
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
You wouldn't tell your mom?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
That's not a good idea.
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
How much did you pay for it?
Yeah...
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Why would I wanna do that?
I did. It was inconclusive.
Bring me players.
Here you go. [throws it over glass]
Oh initially I did.
Mind control.
I can't.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Mm-hmm.
Can I just talk to you for a second?
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Yeah... maybe.
Two for two, keep it up.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
okay.
Okay.
At a gas station. [oscar laughs]
Let's Go!
Hi.
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
Dragging sticks.
Does he ever.
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
Six dollars.
Great. [Jim and Pam walk away]
Bye.
Theater.
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?
Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.
Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Both.  They're both worse.
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
We would really appreciate it.
Thanks Phyl.
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Do you?
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
Green walls.
Yes, yes.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.
Okay, listen.
Okay, what?
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
Pam?
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
I have no idea.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
I said I was working on it.
What's that?
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
Didn't we kind of start it?
That would be great, thank you.
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
How's it going?
Yeah, I know.
Groundhog Day.
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores]
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
So, that's how it's gonna be.
Is that another motto?
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
You mean on a weekend?
No, we don't.
Stop.
So, none of that tipped you off?
Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
Okay, wait, wait.
Sure.
Sorry. Her day.
Really?
Yup.
That is weird.
Okay... Holly's back.
Roy said that.
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
Yeah?
Okay, so we're good.
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
So what is the problem?
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Boyfriend.
Uh... Not a bad day.
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
There it is.
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
What is Yankee Swap?
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
That's exactly what Wallace told us.
Wow, that���s���
And then you just changed desks, right?
How old do you think I am?
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
You've got something on your nose.
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
Give the bottle to Michael!
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
[Windows reboot sound] Altoid?
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
I love you.
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Thanks.
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Okay.
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
Hello?
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
[hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
No, can't help you now.
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
I���m not wearing eyeliner.
No.  Bob, no. No!
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
Oh my God.
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
God!
Hey Dwight.
Love.
[over phone] What?
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
I just needed you to know. Once.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
Thank you, thank you. OK.
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
Perfect. [misses]
Not at all, can we go?
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
All right.
You can't do this.
I'm so sorry, I forgot.
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
Really? I thought I'd take Roy.
I think you should do it. That's great!
[to camera] Just��� so weird.
What?
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
Wait, what? Come on!
Mm-hmm.
That's very...
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
Right? [laughs]
You really don't have his phone number?
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
I don't know. I don't know.
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
Yeah.  Thank you.
Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam]
Um, bottomless champagne.
I guess.
Yep.
Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
What kinda iPhone is that?
Five movies. Go ahead.
No, thanks. I'm good.
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
You playing that game again?
Uh, I heard it.
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
Nope, go back to the script.
Huh.
Can we not?
Right.
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
Oh, God.
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
Yeah. You have fun?
Thanks.
Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
What are you doing here?
A wooden duck?
Well, I think she has a kid.
About ten minutes.
Leave the telescope.
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
Talk to me.
Did that
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
Michael, I really didn't mean to...
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
Is that really what you think?
Michael, I told you.
This is happening.
[Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
Because you���re sitting?
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
What the hell's a rundown?
Not gonna change.
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
I think you mean smug
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
Why don't we just go by ourselves?
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Still haven't left the house yet, huh?
Nope.
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
[on phone] They hate me, Pam.
I surrender.
Alright. Great. Thank you.
Really, what kind of celebrity?
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Great. Where did you get it?
Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.
Hey.
Nothing.
What are you doing?  What, stop...
we good?
First of all, hi.
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
Striker!
[sighs]
Yes, but not by kidnapping.
Boy I---
No way.
Let's start with the wildcard.
Mmm-hmm.
You want music?
Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
You look really pretty.
As opposed to...
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
Hey.
Uh hmm.
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
I mean... [speechless]
Alright.
Come on, man.
I'm sorry? Pam.
That's fine.
Getting my wife a week off from work.
No, no.
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?
Yeah. Good to be back.
No.
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
Let's do it, shoot it.
Paul Anka.
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
Excuse me?
Yikes.
[laughing] He's alright.
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
I think she's awake.
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
What?
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
Katie Holmes.
Great.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
Second line.
Phyllis and Robert.
Alright, my turn.
No.  They're in the conference room.
Okay.
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
Ok, thanks.
Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
I'm alright.
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
Yeah, he's definitely something.
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
[phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
I can also take 3 people.
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow]
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
What are we doing?
Yeah?
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
I think Stanley just coughed.
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Wow.
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
What?
Okay.
Yeah.
Alright.
This is way more than I make now.
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
Don���t-- don���t-- don���t pole people with knives.
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
But you didn't fail.
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
What is happening?
OH! [the 'yes she's hot team' claps]
No.  Thank you.
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
Sorry.
I'm just gonna get...
How can you even be sure?
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
What do you mean?
Nope. Different movie.
Inappropriate.
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
Okay, what's going on?
Not as good as you.
See you tomorrow, Dwight.
You do?
That���s kind of an impossible question.
Really?
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
I uh, I have some ideas, actually...
Conference room?
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
You can try. That, that might work.
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Oh, I thought it was your mom.
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
[enters room] All right. There he is.
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
And doctors.
Hey.
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
[mouths] C'mon!
Yeah. No. Good.
Maybe Stanford would be cool.
Mmm-hmm.
Nothing.
Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
Which one... is she?
Athleap.
Okay.
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
What happened to you?
This rundown better be really good'?
That's a great idea.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Are you serious?
A really awesome baby.
You wouldn't dare.
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
You're writing something?
I absolutely don't understand, either.
You did do it?
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
Uh-
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
It's all good. Are we all good?
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
No.
Do you need us for any of this?
Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Yep. You're being replaced.
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
Oh yeah?
Ah, definitely blue.
Done. Explain.
Thanks, Kev.  I'm good though.
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
[to camera] It's going really well, actually.
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
That's ok.
I just-
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
Was in the green group.
Smart.
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
Big Red Paper Company?
[shudders] Whew.
All right, all right. Okay.
Don't call her 'the mom.'
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
Yeah!
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Oh, OK.
And that's when I knew. You?
Really?
What?
It was.
No. Thank you, though.
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Nice try, this is ridiculous.
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Ready?
Frisbee-based competitions...
Now he is saying 'Hi' louder.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
No.
Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
There is one condition, Michael.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
Just take the parrot.
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
Let's... eh... see ya.
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
Yes.
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
Oh wow, these are nice.
Okay. Roy.
Oh.
No.
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
So... how 'bout let's not?
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
Perfect.
That's what I thought.
Let's go.
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
Oh, yikes.
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
Big day.
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
Hey.
I wouldn't understand or a secret?
Okay. You don���t need my help?
Oh, oh yeah.
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
Hey, David. You got Jim here.
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
It has been, yeah.
In the women's bathroom, above the sink.
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
Wow, that's a lot of keys.
That doesn't matter.
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Oh.  Like nobody.
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Uh, hit and run.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
Hey.
Great. See ya' then.
Weeknights are actually tough just because���
This is all we have.
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
No, you can't fire me.
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
You have a cell phone charger.
Close.
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
[looks shocked] W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.
You still do that thing?
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
No one's moving!
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
Oh, yeah.
That's all right.
You did not know it.
I am still in Philly, actually.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
Um... What's in the bag?
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
See you later.
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
I didn't forget them, they're right here.
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Okay.
Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight]
Thank you.
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
Not cool. [Dwight still laughing]
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
Oh, that could be interesting.
