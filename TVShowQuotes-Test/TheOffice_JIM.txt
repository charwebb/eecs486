[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
So, where did you learn how to play?
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
That is a lie, that is a lie.
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
All right, well it already went through, so...
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
