Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
What about a gift basket full of cash?
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
Is that not what happens when you're high?
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
I think I left my wallet in your house.
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
What award would you like to give Dwight?
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
You know what? I could use a little help.
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
So, where did you learn how to play?
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
But what are you gonna do about that?
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
Can I just talk to you for a second?
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Do you need us for any of this?
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
