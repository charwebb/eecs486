[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Nope, he means tuna dog.
What is it?
You all right?
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
You need to let him go.
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
He hit the pole!
Hey.
Didn't we kind of start it?
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
Forward, definitely.
Yeah. I have a question for you.
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
They're for her to look at, Michael.
Yes, I agree.
I'm so sorry.
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
And stuff... yeah.
No.
Yup. I'll trade.
I don't know.  He looks pretty scrappy.
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
How are you?
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
It's broken right, he can't...
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
I don't think we need opposed.
Sounds good.
Well, at least I don't have cavities.
Right!
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
Hi.
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
I just feel like we're gonna fight.
Hey, how's things?
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
Really?  Power gel?
No, thanks. I'm good.
Thank you very much.
Okay, don't be gross.
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
That's nice.
I'm gonna go to my desk.
So, that's how it's gonna be.
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
Hey, Kelly.
And that's what I told him.
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
Mmm.
Good one.
There it is.
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
[on phone] Hey!  You busy?
Great. Let me just...
It's okay.
Well done.
What's that?
Stop.  That's disgusting.
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Perform a test.
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
Nice job.
That's-- [ding] the password. We're in.
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
Yeah.
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
Oh, sorry, wait one second.
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Yeah, yeah. Totally.
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
Hey.
That's not okay.
Oh, you don't want to know.
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
You're gonna have to talk louder.
Oh.  Let me get it.
[starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev.
As opposed to...
Thanks Phyl.
That's what she said.
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
Michael. Michael.
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
Ok.
Nope.
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
So, we should let him go.
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Don���t-- don���t-- don���t pole people with knives.
All right, I'm taking off.
Don't think you need the corpse then.
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
Where'd I put what?
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
Is it?
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Nope.
Sure. Look at you!
Leave.
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
Sounds great.
What are you doing?
Okay.
Come on.
What's that?
Nope.
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
[mutters] I know, I do.
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
Hey Dwight.
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.
Dwight, please.
All right. Good to be back.
Let me call you right back. Okay.
Cool.
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
Yup.
What���s going on?
What do you know about boobs?
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Oh...
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
That was really rough.
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
You want a birthday pie?
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Yes.
Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.
What?
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
That���s pretty good. I feel safe.
Hey.
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
OK, I'll call the
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
[whispering] Thank you.
What is?
You look cute today, Dwight.
Yep.
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
No, you're definitely the problem.
Sounds good.
Absolutely.
Oh, it's like naughty or nice.
Ok, ok, ok.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
Wait, that's pretty weird.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
Okay.
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
This is happening.
Did you just trademark that...
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
Phyllis! ��Wow.
Oh.
We can custom make them.
Okay. We���ll, just forget it.
[to Gabe] Is it?
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Son, you have to talk louder.
Hey.
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
I... just... if they speak Spanish.
Well, I'm neither of those things, so...
See you tomorrow, Dwight.
Hey, how's it going?
Yeah, totally you did.
Hmmm.
Yeah, it does, actually.
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
Jonas Salk.
Why, what happened?
Which one... is she?
No! No!
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
So now you're writing two things?
Hey, Kev. How you doing?
Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
You used my move, didn't you?
Are you a cocktail waitress?
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
You got it.
Oh my God...
[Windows reboot sound] Altoid?
Yeah, you don't?
Okay.
Yeah.
Not that, don't...
Yeesh, how old is this ship?
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Did it!
This rundown better be really good'?
Duh.
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
You wouldn't tell your mom?
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
On what?
Only two hundred dollars?
Sounds tough.
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
Mm-hm.
I know.  I love it there.
Thank you, delegate from Iceland.
Nope. No dog video.
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
I saw him two minutes ago.
No, no.
Uh...
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
Also good.
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
Fair question.
You okay, man?
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
Yeah.
Oh my God, David. That's horrible.
I surrender.
She wants it bad Michael.
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
It's getting late.
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
She's never worn these glasses before.
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
Ok, sending.
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
And!
Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
But what are you gonna do about that?
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
Michael, just go park the car.
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Who are you talking to, specifically?
OK.
Can you grow up?
Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves]
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
Mm-hmm?
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
Alright.
She's engaged.
What?
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
Um... I don't think so.
Hey!
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
See what?
Okay, I���ll do it.
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
Perfect.
I'm just doing my job, man.
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
All right, easy there, grandpa.
Baquette.
Yeah?
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Yeah.
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
Really.
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
What the hell's a rundown?
Wait, what? Come on!
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!
Yeah.
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
What are you doing?
Hey.
I guess.
I get back from work around 6.
Brace yourself. 3��� 2���
Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]
Hi David.
Really?
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
The raise isn't real.
Actually, you didn't.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
No, stop it.
[enters room] All right. There he is.
Really?
No. Was that the hard way?
Silence.
You like it?
Okay, I'm not doing every number.
I outran it.
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
Yeah.
Yeah. Super pretty.
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.
Alright.
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
Next stop: Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also.
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
That's fine.
Okay, what's going on?
Yes, I... Do you want to...
Hello? Hello?
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
Okay, good then.
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
Nothing.
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
Alright.
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
All right [high fives Kevin]
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
Thanks.
Blonde.
Aww, nuts. [laughs]
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
Alright, I have my wallet.
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
Ow.
Touche?
[opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.
Hey man, good to see you.
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]
Let's Go!
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
What? What, what, what, what, what?
What do we got here?
Yeah, yeah.
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
That's really not cool.
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
I think she's doing a good job.
Striker!
We were.
[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
That's not how that works.
Hey!
Have you ever seen a stripper before?
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
Perfect.
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
1870's...
Kev!
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
Yeah.
[to camera] Just��� so weird.
How so?
Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
That's right.
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
Yep.
Yup.
Cheer up. We made a sale.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
Right there! [points to Cathy]
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
Well, you're probably dehydrated.
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
Do you mean vibrate?
Here we go.  Here we go.
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
Resent you?
Yes.
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
Pam? No!
Michael...
Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
He envies you.
Alright, thanks alot, David.
-Right.
Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
Big deal.
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
You did not force me to do this.
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
[whispering] Here he comes, shhh...
Well, it's just a movie, Dwigt.
We can order in from Hooters.
Jerry.
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
I'm gonna pull the car around.
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
I have noticed that we--
Oh.
It doesn't matter.
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
And I won't.
Oh no.
Your mom.
All right.
No, I'm not doing that!
No, it's not.
Michael.
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
Welcome back.
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
Um, no.
Hi.
You want to talk about it?
Yeah that's great. Great.
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
You a sports fan?
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
I dunno, it's on
It���s a little, uh, personal.
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
No, sometimes its right.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
I really think we should join forces on this one.
Oh!
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
I thought we had that looked at.
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
Good. Please hurry.
Who here heard it from Ryan?
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
You did approve it?
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Best Christmas ever.
Oh, but you didn't.
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
Shhh.
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
Hey! Back here.
Can't do that. Unsanitary.
Dwight.
No, it's not. I did. Yep.
You don't want to arouse suspicion.
... Yes.
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
So, it's not the dumbest idea.
Did you cry?
I'm driving?
It's fascinating.
Yup.
Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
Okay.
No. I would've said no.
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
Okay.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
All right.
Obviously.
Six of one, really.
In the bed.
I was... mocking.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
We were robbed last night.
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
Okay.
Free paper.'
[on the phone] OK.
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
Maybe you should.
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Wow. Thanks.
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
I'll use that.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
Probably just Kelly.
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
That's cool.
Yes! We do. [opens box] Eclairs.
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
Yes. Yeah.
What's up?
Right here.
Wow.  You look--
Glass of water would be a start.
Hey.
Amazing. How do I look?
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
Wow! There it is.
I love it.
What?
[sighs] Gross.
Wait...
I don't think that's gonna...
Ah, I'm sure they're all great.
Crying?
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
Oh, no, absolutely.
No.
Okay.
Yes, but not by kidnapping.
Really? Not Slytherin?
Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
Hi, David.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
What's that?
You're starting your own paper company?
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
Ok. Remember Spider face?
Freecell.
Maybe. Thanks.
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
All right.
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
Oh yeah.
In the picture, are you high?
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
Oh, yeah.
Pam, play by the rules.
You paid for it?
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
You don't know.
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?
What are your top five cases?
Alright.
Well, by worst, you mean the best.
Solitaire?
What's in here?
No.  Bob, no. No!
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
Yeah.
Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
Oh, yeah. She's hot.
Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
[expletive]
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
That���s kind of an impossible question.
Bye.
Gosh.
Hey.
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
I am.
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
Mmm.
Is there anything --
Yeah.
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
What's that?
Oh.  Oh...
Oscar! Uh, what is going on?
And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
Oh.
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
Am I walking out?
I'm gonna introduce myself.
I was just trying to be unbiased.
