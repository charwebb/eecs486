[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Now how do you know how it works?
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
How far away did you think we were?
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
I liked you better when you were the temp.
I don���t know how else to tell you.
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
We should take a look at those surveys.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
It's still on a bike path though right?
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
