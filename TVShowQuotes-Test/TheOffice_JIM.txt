Perform a test.
I do remember, yeah.
So, none of them?
Yeah. That does not feel good.
Yeah, she does like Elmo.
What?
She's engaged, um... to me.
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
I don't know, dad. I don't know.
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
I can also take 3 people.
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
You must be out or something.
Wow, that's not what I meant.
Mmm.
That's a guarantee.
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
[mouthing] So close.
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Right? So, uh, let's uh...
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!
What's that?
Get out.
Okay.
Was that not the--
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
Nice.
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
Erin.
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
Yikes. [everyone gasps]
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
Wind.
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.
No, it's not. I did. Yep.
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
What's up?
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
Yeah!
You're not going to freak out?
I said I was working on it.
Yes. Yeah.
No problem.
Jim Halpert.
I can.
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
Yep.
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
I'm couching it!
Excuse me.
Hey, easy, easy...
Yeah, she's doing really well.
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
Do you want a corn dog?
Wow.
Andy--- Ohh...
And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
Umm, Michael.
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
It's hard to tell so far.
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
Oh, yeah. She's hot.
No, you can't fire me.
What is it?
Okay, okay.
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
Mm-hmm.
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
Yeah. Right?
You can try. That, that might work.
What's that?
What are you doing?
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
[whispering to Pam] Let���s go outside
Did you just come up with that?
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
You have a cell phone charger.
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
Really?
O-Kay.
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
Fantastic.
All right!
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
[disgusted groan]
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
You don't want to arouse suspicion.
Oh! Lots of results.
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
Beardy?
Sometime today.
Lousy Picture.
What?
Silence.
Oh.  Oh...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
Mm-hmm.
What's that?
[shakes head]
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
All right.
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
Oh, wow. But, um���Oh, I get that.
Who was that?
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
Don't call her 'the mom.'
You know what? That's private.
Are we even sure that's my file?
Urkel Grue.
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
You know that���s���
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
Cranford?  No.  We will never watch that.
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
Uh hmm.
Six dollars.
What are your top five cases?
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
I'm irate right now.
[concerned look on face] You okay?
So now you're writing two things?
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Why, what happened?
I disagree.
Ransom.
Why?
Goggles?
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
Hey, Toby.
Yeah... yep.
Really?
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
I know.  I love it there.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
I just feel like we're gonna fight.
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
Nice. Well, what's it all about?
Do you speak Spanish?
Can't wait.
You wouldn't tell your mom?
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Aww.
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
Just about... yup. Now.
Oh.
I'm on minute six of this message.
He can't hear you?
Thanks for inviting us, by the way-
Whoa. You are a volunteer.
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
Okay.
Okay, man, easy.
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
All right.
Good one.
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
Okay, good then.
Wait, you alright?
KGB.
No. No, I'm not gonna-no.
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
Okay, let's go.
Oh man. [laughs]
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
Thank you.
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
How are you?
Oh no. I was just -
Dwight! Are your legs broken?
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
[Whispers] Please stop that!
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
And that's all?
Come on, get inside.
Great. What's new with you?
Oh I'm sorry.  What?
I love it.
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Yeah.
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
Nice.
That's cool.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
Yeah, that was nuts.
I wouldn't understand or a secret?
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
Umm...
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
Robert.
I'm gonna get a second opinion.
Oh yeah.
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
Um...
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
Yeah.
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
You can write a book about chairs.
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
Hey, Jan.
Is that trash talk from Pam?
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
That's okay.
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Oh.
Oh yeah?
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Sorry, Stinky, can���t do it. Too busy.
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.
Let me call you right back. Okay.
Ok, sure. Will do.
[approaching Michael] You have to stop this.
Yeah?
See ya.
[to Pam] What?
Mm-hmm.
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
No.
How is it my fault?
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
Oh my God.
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
What? No, no, it's not a vote.
What?
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
Seems like a nice enough guy.
We'll figure it out.
What? What, what, what, what, what?
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
Wow.
[stops the watch] One second.
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
Oh.
Wow. What kind of bike is that?
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I address that?
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
Whoa.
985,000,000,000,017.00
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
Oh, yeah. Pregnant.
Co-manager, actually.
Good.
No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.
I... just... if they speak Spanish.
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Yeah.
I know. It's very cute.
Oh my God.
That makes sense.
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
Michael.
Umm���.
Thank you very much.
Which is you.
Yup. I'll trade.
[leave the conference room to address everyone]
I'm alright.
Why not?
Who's that?
No.
You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
All the time.
You're breathing very heavily.
Any luck?
Sounds complicated.
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
Pam.
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
What is it?
He didn't mention me, did he?
Wait.
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
Pam, will you marry me?
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
Not gonna change.
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
Oh yeah, definitely.
Uh--
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Yeah, I thought you started it.
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
Okay.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
For this?
No, I'm not doing that!
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
Baquette.
Ok great.
Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
Oh, the best.
Theater.
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
Oh no, that would be great.
Do you?
Is there some evidence?
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
Which ideally would be me....
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
Wow, that is��� wow.
Wait, what?
What's what?
You know her name.
Their bread is very good.
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
Well, in an ideal world...
Okay.
What kinda iPhone is that?
Wow. Busy morning.
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
What's that cooler?
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
Actually here for something else.
Oh, my God.
Right? [laughs]
Right, the one from England.
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
Hey guys, what're we talking about?
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
Ok.
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
I���m just gonna call you back. Thanks.
O..ok. Um..good.
Yeah, yeah.
Why would I wanna do that?
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
That's alright.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?
Hey Dwight.
Really?
I did. It was inconclusive.
This is happening.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Yes.
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
What?
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
[In staff meeting] See these forms...
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
[nervously] Pretty good.
Mm-hmm.
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
It just feels a little bit, like...
Yeah.
Really was.
No, I'm not gonna call you that.
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
Yup, coming. [opens door] All right.
Great!
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
Isn't that thing huge?
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
I can see that.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
Now, you listen to me, sir.
I would love to hear the other mottos.
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
���And shove it up my butt.���
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
I think you should retrace your steps.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Oh initially I did.
Thanks.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
Really?
Ooh! Are you nuts?
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
Yeah, I did. [they kiss]
Ok.
To one without a cubicle.
You look really pretty.
Bye, Dwight.
Go.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
They're for her to look at, Michael.
Oh, that's good.
Still haven't left the house yet, huh?
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
And I am always busy.
Of course.  What is like a hostage?
I think she will.
I get it.
Sure. That they should do one.
Don't beat yourself up.
Oh, there he goes.
I'm going with grape.
Yeah.
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
In the bed.
No.
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
What?
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
Maybe poison?
Nope.
Are you alright?
No.
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
Was that your mom?
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
I'm... leaving on June 8th.
OK.
For a lot of reasons.
Hello?
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
That���s true, yeah.
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
I'll take it.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
So, you ready for the... the Dundies?
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
[whispers to Pam] Ok, your turn.
Lucky us.
Um, bottomless champagne.
So, the situation is the worst.
...talk about it.
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
You alright, Santa?
All right.
No, I don't.
Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
Mm-hmm.
What?
He definitely stole my iPod.
We can order in from Hooters.
That is me. Wish me luck.
Pam! You can't be serious.
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Let's do it.
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert.
Oh, OK.
Who is it?
Dead goose.
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
What?
You all right? You ok?
[in office] Are you sure?
That's not okay.
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
No one's moving!
Nice. Third book?
All right, all right. Okay.
Okay.
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
Damn.
Does the Department of Health know about this?
Really.
He never called a meeting.
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
Ooh.
Love you too. Bye.
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
Not my favorite, but...
Uh��� yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
Oh. Is that like your new thing?
Best prank ever.
We should go on a double date.
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Too late, Kev.
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious]
I just needed you to know. Once.
Kev, have a good weekend.
To get married.
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
What?
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
[Phone rings] Oh God.
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
And what happens here is-
Still decorative.
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
I���m gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Not bad.
Right.
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
No, because of the promotion.
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
It's fascinating.
Which one?
No.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
Cool.
OK.
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
Beesley, coffee?
Everything's fine.
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
All right.
We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
See what?
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
Someone's in a bad mood.
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
Oh, sorry, wait one second.
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
Now that sounds serious.
The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
Can I just talk to you for a second?
[starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev.
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
Hmm. Doubt it.
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
Well, I second that emotion.
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
Definitely.
Into a lake.
All right-
Alright.
You wanna do this?
No.
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
Wake up. [sprays Dwight]
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
Wow, that���s���
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--
Here we go.  Here we go.
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
I think she's doing a good job.
Of course.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
Nice job everybody. Great work.
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
I know.
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
You a sports fan?
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
Uh-huh.
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
65. Ok, no need to laugh.
we good?
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...
Thanks.
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
It's a lunch thing.
Did you just say you remember him?
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
Look at that form.
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
