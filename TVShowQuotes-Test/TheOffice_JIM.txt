Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
You could just be saying it to get the job.
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
You want to just make a run for it?
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
I think that's the question that you had...
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
We should take a look at those surveys.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
If you could help me out, that would be���
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
We were just kids.  What did we know?
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
