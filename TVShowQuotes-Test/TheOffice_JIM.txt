Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
Getting my wife a week off from work.
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Okay, you could just show up late though.
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim���s desk, kicking things in the process.]
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
The next year he really stepped things up.
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Is that not what happens when you're high?
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
Where do you want to go for dinner?
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
