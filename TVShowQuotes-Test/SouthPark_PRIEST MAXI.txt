Well we have to try. Our religion is dying!
Fathers, I want to thank you all for coming.
It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ.
I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it.
Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion.
Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh.  Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you!
