Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh.  Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you!

Whoa, whoa, hold on a second! The problem is that children are being molested, not that they're reporting it! 

Right, and so... wa- wait a minute. What?

No I didn't! All that's dead are your stupid laws and rules!  You've forgotten what being a Catholic is all about.  This... book. You see, these are just stories.  Stories that are meant to help people in the right direction. Love your neighbor. Be a good person.  That's it! And when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power, well... Well, you end up with this.  People are losing faith because they don't see how what you've turned the religion into applies to them! They've lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion, and when they have no mythology to try and live their lives by, well, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths! 

I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it.

Now, let us pray.  Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen.
