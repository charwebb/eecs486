Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.  And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too.  Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service. 
That's definitely a Japanese boat.  Looks like they're whaling now.
