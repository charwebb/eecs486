Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!

Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around.  It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool!  However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such. 

Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?

This certainly is a friendly town.  You've all been sssssso wonderful.
