Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!

The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.

Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!

You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!

Wow, a pony ride. Neat.

Oh! That is so juvenile! 

I just... well... I want you to beg for it.

Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.  I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers.

What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?

Goddammit. That isn't funny!

Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.

Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.

Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!

There are hard feelings! This isn't over! I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done! And do you know why??

Not so fast! 

Hey guys. Hey guys! 

"Oink oink oink."

Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! 

I told you I have to eat every two hours.
