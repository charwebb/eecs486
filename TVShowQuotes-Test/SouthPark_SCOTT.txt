Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!

They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!

Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!

Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up!  What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?!  Oh shit!

You're a dick.

Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.

Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! 

"Here's my snout."

Hello?

What are you idiots doing?!

You're a dick.

I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.

Ey! What are you doing?!

En garde!Â 

Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.

I'm not sure I should trust you.

Wow, a pony ride. Neat.

Goddammit. That isn't funny!

Jeaaaaah!
