Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty.
Sure.  I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour! 
You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!
You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!
This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid!
Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!
It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! 
Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! 
Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.
