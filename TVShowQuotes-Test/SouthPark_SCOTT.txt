This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day! 
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?
Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you. 
Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! 
And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them! 
There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.
Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up!  What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?!  Oh shit!
Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?
They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!
What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!
