Home.

So you... remarried.

Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over.

After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world!

I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again.
