Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now!
All right, just let me get my toothbrush. 
I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we...
But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!
Son...  You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on! 
Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?
I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.
We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
