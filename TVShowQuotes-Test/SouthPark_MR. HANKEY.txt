They're too young to drink, honey.

Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!

Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up.

Golly, that isn't very nice.  I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.

Ky-yle! Ky-yle!

Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!

I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we...

But crap is everything. 
Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day
Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why
Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again
And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea.
And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside
Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive
By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand
So it can spring to life and become food for the land!
It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe
It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass
''The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
To make food for the humans and start all over again
You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life.

No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?

Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?

Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap.

Come clo-ser.

Do you know a way?

No, you did it, boys!
