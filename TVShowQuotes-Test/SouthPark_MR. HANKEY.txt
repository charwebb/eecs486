Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.
Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength. 
Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht.
Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train.
Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!
Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids!  This is our son, Cornwallis.
