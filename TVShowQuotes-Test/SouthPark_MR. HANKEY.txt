Not real? Well shucks.  If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song? 
Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day''

Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home.
Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up.
Say, that sounds like a swell idea.  We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas.
Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.
Closer!  One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture. 
I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.
Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman.
