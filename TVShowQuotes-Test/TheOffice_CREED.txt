I can get you one in an hour.
I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?
What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. 'What do I do?'... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. 'Qua' something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
My wife���s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office]  Sorry I'm late, boss.  What's going on?
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...
[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
