Ok, thirty seconds to showtime!
[chuckles] I know. Isn't it something?
The feeling of pure risk.
That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Animals can't feel pain.
Who said that?
Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...
One year, I had a close acquaintance of mine back a truck in here and clean out this whole place. That was a very good year. I think they blamed it on some kid.
[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.
Can't be good.
Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.
The perfect cartwheel.

[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
Me neither.
It's not cool.

[feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents.
I'd like to contribute.
You're welcome.
[smacks Meredith���s head] [screams] [runs out]
[singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...
