Tapas swiss miss.
I hate devils food.
I'm out.
Good work, kid.
Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up 'get out of jail free' cards, those things cost thousands.
No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.
Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?
I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.
[smacks Meredith���s head] [screams] [runs out]
Yeah. [Jim enters room]
Okay.
Hell of an ass.
Touch me and I'll sue.
Did you start the paperwork yet?
We're screwed.
Well nobody's touching my cobbler.
So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
Hey!
When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
The perfect cartwheel.
I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless.
I don't know, man. I just don't know.
Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
Hey, thanks, ace.
The real question here is who's this guy work for?
In a way you did.
No.
Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work.
I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.
I'm having a little trouble motivating.
In a minute.
No, no. I had some, thanks.
I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
What's a text?
Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
Undo it!
I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The 'O'...
About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I've been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.
We're not playing strip pong? [Jim shakes his head no]  Okay. [Creed picks up paddle]
I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.
Are you gonna add any more?
[Bluetooth rings] You got Creed.
