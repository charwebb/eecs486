Yeah, you.
You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.
I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat.
What if you've been bad?
[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office]  Sorry I'm late, boss.  What's going on?
Yeah, that's all-inclusive.
Have you tried making everything smaller?
[approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.
Well nobody's touching my cobbler.
Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
I still have my medal from that.
I understand it, I can't speak it.
All right.
Pam, this is important. Was he me? Am I him?
No, you have the power to undo it.
I can get you one in an hour.
Me neither.
Night
[after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?
Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Well, I can't, I don't know how.
Hello. [Jim replaces Creed's apple with a potato][Creed takes a bite of the potato]
Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
What do you mean, 'Why?'
That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?
My tombstone's already made, thank you.
I'd send you to Hong Kong.
It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
[chuckles] I know. Isn't it something?
What?
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
Ugh.
Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?
I don't know.
How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good.
No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
Fright. Being scared to death.
Th-the hair covers it, mostly.
I'm not good with names.
Kids, kids, kids, slow down.
Yep.
Get her Phyll.
She's one sassy black lady.
