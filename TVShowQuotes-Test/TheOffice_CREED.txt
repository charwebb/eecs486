If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
Remember, you���re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
OK. Hang on just a second.  Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
[singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...
Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
[running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I���m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She's got some children.
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
[holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
The real question here is who's this guy work for?
