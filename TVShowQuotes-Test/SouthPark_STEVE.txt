Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend?Â 
The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.
Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?
I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.
Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?
