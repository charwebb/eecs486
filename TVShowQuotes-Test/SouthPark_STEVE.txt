Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.
This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
All right. Well, just keep working on those donations. 
What? But Token's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what to—Oh God! 
Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!
