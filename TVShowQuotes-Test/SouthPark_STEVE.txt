So far, Jimmy has raised $16!

Oh, Jesus, not that one! 

Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?

I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.

All right, kids, you know what time of year this is?  That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp?

What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!

That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded!Â
