Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar.
What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that! [opens door to leave]
Yeah. Way ,way, way back.
Hola. Que tal?
Uh...I mean-yeah.
I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
