Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, "Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls." 

Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?

I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!

If we can hold on through the night.
We have a chance to find the sunshine.

Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.

Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"

Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!

Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.

They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!

Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects.

And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?

Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.

All right. Now, where did you get served?

Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww! 

I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.

Get in the car, children! Get in the car! 

And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.

Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, "Go Fudge Yourself," or my all-natural, "I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."

Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.

That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. 

Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.

You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.

Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.

No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!

Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...  What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?

Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.

Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press "menu," then "function." 

And do you have any idea what that means?

No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her.

Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?

Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.

Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?

Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.And then you're left with nothing, cause your tinking with your dong.&lt;p&gt;So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!Just play it cool and don't be a fool...

Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?

Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?

My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.

Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh?  Pretty cool, ain't it?

Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.

Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.

We have to find a way to stop those aliens!

Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive bastards!

Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?

No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.

Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?!

They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems" 

Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.

Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?

Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. 
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!

Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!

I have a lo-o-o-o-o-ong way to come to go to raise the kind of money I need. 

Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
