You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!

Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too!

Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.

All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. 

Oooo! Call the doctor!

Monday??

I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey.  The whole town is about to kill each other.

Well, you sure do act like it.

What do we do with it now?

Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! 

Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'! 

Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.

Chirstmas poo?  You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.

Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!

That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?

Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park.

Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!

I'm goinna- I'm gonna-

Spank it, ever so gently.

Waait!  He's still breathin'! He's not dead.

Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?

Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.

How 'bout you and me-

Welcome to the planetarium. 

Where the hell have you been Stan?!

Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog.

...Is that what I said?

Eric, where did you hear that song?

Hike the damn ball! 

Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million.

No Pip, I'm sorry!

Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine.

Change the flag! Change the flag!â€¦

It's a little late for that bullcrap now.

Butt sex?

It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!

I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.

Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.And then you're left with nothing, cause your tinking with your dong.&lt;p&gt;So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!Just play it cool and don't be a fool...

Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.

Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.

Eric, that's enough!

Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.

'Scuse me. Do you work here?

Can you see anything, children? 

We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.

Hmmm. 

No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.  Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.  Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.

I know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.

All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!

Or haaauuunted hash browns.

Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game.

I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.

Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.

Get in here! 

Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric.

Hello there, children!

Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?

It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail.

It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  This could mean the visitors want to communicate with us.

You will?

Hello there, children.

Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and "shit", could be linked!

Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?  Ask your parents for once!

Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!

Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.

Cartman?

The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?

Doctor, do you have- children?

Get out! It's gonna blow! 

Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?

It's okay, pop.

Kiss my black ass!! 

You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!

Hey! Where's he goin'?

Hmmm.  I don't think we have a chance.

I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.

It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!

Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.

Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.

LaToya Jackson, children.

Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?

...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!

Iii do!

Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!

Why bad?

Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?

Of course! That's it!

I need to know how far it is, lady!

Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.

Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!

Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.
