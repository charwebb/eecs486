There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.

Well, it worked once before. 

That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! 

I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.

Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.

Hello there, children!

Elementary school alumni?

Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.

Right. But do you know why they're bad?

What the..?

That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.

Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??

Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to ya woman
Gonna lay ya down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make ya moan and perspire
Gonna--

You're not?

What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.

I have a lo-o-o-o-o-ong way to come to go to raise the kind of money I need. 

Well!  You can believe in him now. 

Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.

Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.

Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.

Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.

Well, doctor?

I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.

We- 

What? We have to get to the hospital.

Hello there, children! 

Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.

Why bad?

Monday??

This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.

Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.

That's right. We have to go see him in New York.

How are you doing?

All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!

Children! You are screwing up my wedding! 

Waait!  He's still breathin'! He's not dead.

Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?

I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey.  The whole town is about to kill each other.

Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!

Come on everybody. You got to help the children.

Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.

No Pip, I'm sorry!

But... I'm not rich.

Hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...

He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.

Children, what the hell are you doin'?

And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!

Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.

Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!

Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.

It's really gonna piss you off.

Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?

Oh! Uh, hello there, children.

Knights of Standards and Practices?

All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.

No. Not since 'Yentl.

What? We did it! Children, we won!

Yes Pip, what is it?

God damned aliens! 

Why bad?

Hello there, children!

What's the matter?

Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! 

Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.

Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"

Oh my God. Eric?

It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!

Oohhhh  ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here!  ...These children tricked me!

Well, it's true.

Hello?

Say, where's Kyle?

And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.

So how do we get to it?

If we can hold on through the night.
We have a chance to find the sunshine.

Why not??

Mmmm
Baby, every time that we kiss
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat
Lava so warm and red and wet
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.

Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!

Hello there, children.

Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. 

That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.

Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!

Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww! 

You will?

Who are you?

Seventeen! You're ready. 

What do you guys think?

Whose goose?

Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?

Hello children.

Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her.

Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
