Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. 
Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww! 
Oh my God! We have to stop them!
That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do! 
I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.
What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?
I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!
Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! 
Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!
That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office. 
Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. 
I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.
I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children.  You should hang on to it.
Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! 
Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.
From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!
Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?
So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?
It's a little late for that bullcrap now.
Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
What?!  What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!
Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go. 
Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. 
My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about "shit".
Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. 
Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'! 
He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.
Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.
Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?
Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems" 
Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.
But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies.
Father, why did you go to all this trouble?
Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.
Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.
I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
