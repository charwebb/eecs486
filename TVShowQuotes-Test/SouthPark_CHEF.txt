Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!
Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!
No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.
What?!  What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!
We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.
Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!
Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'! 
Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!
Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!
So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer,  "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote several years ago.
It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children.
Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.
You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.
Oh my God! We have to stop them!
Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.
I just like to make love up your butt.
If we can hold on through the night.
We have a chance to find the sunshine.
Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.
The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."
Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!
Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.
Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.
Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do! 
I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-  Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? 
But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!
I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!
No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.
Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and "shit", could be linked!
All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. 
No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.  Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.  Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.
Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! 
Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.
You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--
No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body.
But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!
We've got to get him to the hospital.
OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly.
Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!
Ooo, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red
Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.
Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?
Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go. 
Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better.
It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  This could mean the visitors want to communicate with us.
Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.
Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with $2 million, I'm going to jail.
Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.
Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! 
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.
Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?
