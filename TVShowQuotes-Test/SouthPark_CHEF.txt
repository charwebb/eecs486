Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.
How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
Do I look like I have $2 million?
This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa.
Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.
That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?
Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.
But not like that, son. Like this: "Daaare". 
Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! 
You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!
That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. 
Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.
All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.
And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.
Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.
What makes you think I would know anything about that?
That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... 
We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! 
Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.
Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park.
You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens.
It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it. 
I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-  Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? 
Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.
This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.
That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! 
It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.
Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
Well, all right. Maybe I will go. Iâ€™ll play them my version of the song.
Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??
Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!
Right. But do you know why they're bad?
And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, "Fudge This."
Baby, you know you're the girl for me-eeAnd all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and meAnd her; simultaneousYou and me, and you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three; simultaneousOoh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what? A giant snake? Killing everybody?! Growing bigger?! Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, futch ya. Simultaneous, you and meAnd you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three...
Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.
Oh, damn it, not now!  Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!
Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.
Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them! 
I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."
Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.
I don't think we're outta the woods yet. 
Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!
Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.
Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go. 
Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too!
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles
Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.
