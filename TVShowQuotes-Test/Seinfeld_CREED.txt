I do not.
Yeah, you.
I still have my medal from that.
Creed! Ha!
Bonnie Hunt is on.
It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]
Let's put a smile on that face!
Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?
I want to sell your blood!
I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
I thought you were gay.
No...
Suit yourself.  But, if it were me, Botox [points at Oscar], wig [points at Kevin].
Bald people make me sick.
[on phone] Daat!
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
No.
It's Kismet!
Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor���s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed���s head] Oh!
I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.
Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
I don't care which party I go to. Once you've danced naked at a hash bonfire with the spirits of the dead, all parties seem pretty much the same.
Think they're talking about me?
We should start our own mall!
Who's the OB/GYN?
Yep. That's exactly what happened.
Oh my goodness.
Okay. What about your friend?
Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
[over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed.
Whacky-weed Creed.
I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.
You ever notice you can ooze two things: sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.
No, but I still have my medal from that.
Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?
What if you've been bad?
Oh. [laughs]
Us? You and me. The old timers.
Are you gonna add any more?
Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.
We hate Pam. We hate Pam.
Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair...
