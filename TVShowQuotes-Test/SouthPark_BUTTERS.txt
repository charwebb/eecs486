It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.

Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.

Whoa, hey Eric.

Uh, not exactly.

My, my picture?

Wow! A present just for me? 

Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.

Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! 

Well... hah... HWAAAH! 

Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!

Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?

Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.

Uh ohhh.

Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 

No, it's a school night!

What do I do?!

Olé!

Whoa! Hey Dad! 

Well, she sure is.

Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."

Pardon me?

Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!

But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...

Hang on a second, here! 

Oh... Thank you. 

But...  but you're here right now. 

Well, sure I can!

Who, me?

Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?

Why are they gonna kill my parents?

Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.

Ahah-oo well, alright then. 

Going now! 

Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.

Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!

Oh no!

Oh golly.  Hey, what's happening down there? 

Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.

Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.

What?! You said nobody would know!

A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.

Huh, me neither.

Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.

Well okay!

AWESOM-O! 

Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 

Great benefit, Eric!

Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?

This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.

I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.

Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?

The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!

Oh I'm sorry, mom.

Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 

Whatoyou mean?

Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?

I'm trying, sir! 

Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!

Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. 

How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?

Uh what condition?

AGH! No! Please! You can't!

You think Jewpacabra is here?

Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!

Wuuuuhhhhhh! 

What's a urinal?

ARRRRRRGH!

Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.

Well I can certainly see why.

Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now

Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.

Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.

Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 

I'm sorry.

Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-

Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.

Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 

Uh, well, to solve mysteries.

Well, no, not quite.

I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it

He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.

Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.

I'll throw in a dollar!

What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.

Giddy up! 

What the-?  Who's there? Who is that?!

Huh uh.

Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. 

That's nice. 

We finally did it!

AAAAAAAAAAH! 

Oh Jesus! 

Well, then... then let me go with you.

It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!

"Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser."

Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.

That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.

Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 

Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.

Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 

I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.

Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.

Okay, subject is ready.

Yeah.  It sure does hurt.

When do you wanna see me?

Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.

Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.

Wow!

I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!

Oh yeah? 

No it doesn't.

Hey fellas. What's happenin'?

NOOooo!

You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?

Oh God, oh God!

Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.

Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 

Oh, all right then.

Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.

Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 

Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.

Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!

My grandma??

Well, uh, see ya, fellas. 

The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.

Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!

How bad is it, doctor?

Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.

We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!

Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?

I'm getting a surprise! 

Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 

We can?

Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.

Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.

A conspiracy?

Hey! Ours is still alive!

Oh Jesus no.  They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here!  Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! 

Comin' dad! 

Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?

Are you being serious?

I sure am, Dad!

How far away is June?

Uh thanks! 

Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!

Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 

I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?

I know.

Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 

Hey look! 

I tried to make a good picture. Honest.

Bwaagghh! 

Lexus! 

Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 

Well, o- okay Mom.  Bah! Gah! 

Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.

Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.

Hey, fellas.

Just stop, please.

What's that?

Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!

Are you sure?

Oh, sweet Jesus.

I do. 

I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.

Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'

It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.

Well, sure thing, Dad.

Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.

Well, hooray!

Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 

Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.

Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.

Ahhh. 

Can I go now?

Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!

Uh oh.

Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?

Hey yeah, all the time.

Well, like what?

Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.

Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?

What are you whoofelin' at? 

Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?

Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!

I'm trying!

But this is what I keep seeing in my head!

Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 

Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.

Nobody asked.

Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?

Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 

Huh, I'm over here, Dad.

Huh-it sure was.

Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?

You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!

Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!

Uh, that's me!

How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?

Oh God! I hate cannibals!

Oh they, they do, huh?

There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.

Naw, I'm lyin'

Vampires. I've seen them.

Yeah?

Not again.

Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!

I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. 

Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.

Already? Oh no!

He told me to!

Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.

Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?

The government watches everything we do?

Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?

Huh-I'm in for five!

Meheecan, it's your

You're not a cannibal, are you?

Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?

Sellin' kisses?

Yes! Yehhehehes!

Yeah. You're right. 

Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.

Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?

AAaaghagh!

It does?

A midget?

AH- 

No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?

Holy Moly.

So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?

Oh jeez. 

Yeah, I'm broooding.

Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.

Nnn-how terrible?

Hey Eric.

Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.

Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-

Well, we're here, now what do I do? 

Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."

Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.

Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.

But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!

Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."

Yeeah. Is it true?

Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 

Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?

Well first, he went to see a movie.

I'm sorry!

Hang on, Lemmiwinks!

Uh wait.  You guys aren't comin' with me?

AAAH!  Oh Jesus.

Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?

Okay. 

Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.

When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.

Huh but I thought you were one!

Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 

And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.

Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya!
