No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!

Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 

The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.

You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?

I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.

Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.

But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 

Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 

Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.

I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 

Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.

Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.

Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!

I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.

I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 

Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 

Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"

I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 

Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?

Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.

I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 

Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!

Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!

They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.

He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!

Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.

But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!

...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!

Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.

Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.

HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!

So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!

Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-

Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.

Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?

Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!

Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!

Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?

Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-

Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?

I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?

I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!

What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.

Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.

How are things... oing with your new best friend?

Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?

Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!

Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 

Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?

Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?

There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 

Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.

Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"

I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.

The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!

Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."

Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?

Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!

So we wanted to come here and be pirates.

Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.

Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!

Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!

Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!

Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?

Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.

Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?

Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.

Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 

Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 

OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.

Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!

Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 

Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!

Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-

Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!

Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!

Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"  "Huh, Butters, ma'am."   "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"  "Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." 

In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.

Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.

Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?

That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  

Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?

Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.

...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.

Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 

I tried to make a good picture. Honest.

Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.

You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.

It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.

Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?

Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?

Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.

It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.

I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!

The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!

Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.

It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!

Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.

Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?

Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.

Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.

Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 

Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.

Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!

Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?

Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.

Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.

That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.

We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.

Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.

But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?

I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.

Just hold it. That's what I do now. 

What about my parents. Did you see them?

Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 

Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?

I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.

Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.

All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 

Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-

He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!

Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.

Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.

Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.

Come on! What are you guys goin' as?

Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!

Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?
