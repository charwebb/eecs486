I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!
They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 
Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
That way it won't matter if you get detention.
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
Well, then... then let me go with you.
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 
Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
You don't know how hard it is to be me. 
I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!

Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 
PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? 
Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
Whre do we go? Where do we go?
Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!
Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
Oh no, what did I do this time?
Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 
Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
When do you think uh it'll get here?
Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!  Oh, I'm all sticky. 
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.
Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
