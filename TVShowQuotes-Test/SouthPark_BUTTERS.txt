You can see the momma bird fly in.
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 
Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
That way it won't matter if you get detention.
Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.
There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"  "Huh, Butters, ma'am."   "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"  "Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." 
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 
There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 
It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!
I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."
A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.
Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 
Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 
Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.
It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two!
