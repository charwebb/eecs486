I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!"  Yeah!
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.
Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 
Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 
But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? 
Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?
Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.
Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. 
Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!
A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!
Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 
Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 
I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. 
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? 
It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! 
Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 
Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."
Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
