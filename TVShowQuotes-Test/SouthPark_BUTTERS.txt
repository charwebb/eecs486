But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!
There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."  "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 
I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! 
We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 
Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.
They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.
Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  "To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 
Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.
Oh no, what did I do this time?
Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? 
Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.
Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."
Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 
Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 
Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!
There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 
Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!
That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...
