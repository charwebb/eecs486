I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.

Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. 
Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.
Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 
O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
But I just did what he told me!
What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
Does this mean... you have to go now?
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
You can see the momma bird fly in.
That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.
Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 
...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays.
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 
You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
But I gotta get back to my family.
I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 
Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.
It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
