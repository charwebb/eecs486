Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.

Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!

Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!

Somebody killed Kickstarter!

Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. 

Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.

Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.

That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!

I'm not lettin' go!

I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!

You said "go ahead".

Oh boy, I sure am nervous.

Hey! Everything okay, Stan?

Son of a biscuit!

Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!

I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!

I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.

Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!

What's this?

AAAAAAAAAAH! 

Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! 

Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.

Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!

Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.

Ah I will, Mom.

Ahh, dangit! 

...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.

Uh, what's that?

That's me!

What's this all about, Eric?

Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.

Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.

Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!

Sure, Kyle.

He had sins that he didn't confess!

You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?

Wuh, wait, well, what happened??

Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."

Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.

Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.

Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!

Oh! Are we out for an adventure? 

What?! They called the cops?!

An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.

Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!

Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!

Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?

...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
Oh, nutsack  Oops.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. 

You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!

So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.

Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.

Whoa, I'm getting woozy.

Uh but I spent it all.

So we wanted to come here and be pirates.

But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?

Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.

Ah, I was at home.

That's me!

I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?

...A pimp. Huh...

Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.

Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?

Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?

Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!

...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!

No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!

Kenny, be careful!

Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.

Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!

Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.

Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.

I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.

Wuh what are you gonna do?

Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!

Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.

Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?

Eeyeah, I'm psyched.

Yeah, I can't believe it!

Huh?

Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 

Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.

Uh w-where??

Aw man.

Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.

Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 

Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!

Boy, it sure is stinky in here!

Awwwww.

Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 

Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.

The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.

Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!

That's right.

I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?

How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.

My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.

Ahhh. 

Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.

W-what?

Oh Jesus! They were??

Just stop, please.

What?

Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. 

Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore.
Uh, it sure is!

Feel stupid yet?

Huh... 

Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 

Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-

Ahhh!

Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.

We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.

Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?

Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!

I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!

Uh, that's me!

Who?

We are?

Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!

I just... w-was seein' if it works.

Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?

Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.

The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.

I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!

Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.

Huh?

Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!

Oh hamburgers!

Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!

But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...

Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 

Yeah.  It sure does hurt.

Wow, neato! An album cover! 

I'm freaking out...

On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! 

Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.

Ha-ey fellas. 

Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!

Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!

Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."

Work, Mexican, Work.  Work, Mexican, Work

Yes sir.

Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?

Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-

Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.

It is true!

Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.

Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.

Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-

I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 

No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?

Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.

Ah.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!

Hawww, you lived?

My weiner??

No! 

Please, leave me alone.

HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?

Whre do we go? Where do we go?

Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?

Thanks. 

Oh well, hi there everybody. 

Uh thanks! 

Oh boy!

They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?

Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?

I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.

"Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser."

I didn't say anything. I promise.

Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 

You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.

Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.

Whoops! 

Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.

Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.

I'm not makin' a face, mom!

Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.

Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.

Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale.

Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!

Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?

Wuuuuhhhhhh! 

Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.

Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"

Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 

NASCA- NASCAR?

They'll find love somewhere else.

I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. 

But they killed Lemmiwinks!

Uh-get set. Go! 

Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."  "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 

No, it's a school night!

Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 

They've got special effects! 

There he is!  It's Lemmiwinks! 

Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.

Hey! Where do you think you're going?!

Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 

Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 

...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 

Y yes, yes sir. 

No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!

But Wendy's coming to fight you.

Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 

Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!

W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. 

Oh Jesus no.  They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here!  Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! 

Me too!

Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!

HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!

AAAH!  Oh Jesus.

Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.

For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'.  Ah I'm not grounded.

Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?

Oh, all right then. 

Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.

Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!

Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.

... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?

Oh. Well, uh okay. 

No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!

I'll never let go! 

Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 

Let's dance. 

Please. It's urgent.

I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.

Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! 

Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!

Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.

Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!

Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 

It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!

Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.

Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.

Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!

Hey Eric.

Sexy Action School News Team, ho! 

Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?

Hu-oh! Goody!

Nobody likes meee...

OH GOSH!

Okay!!

Oh no!
