Stan, I wanna talk to you about family. 
I've been such a bastard all these years, and I finally understand. And it it it feels great! If I feel like- I feel like I'm in my own Christmas special. You see...
Holidays are that special time
When we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozy
Forget about being angry for a day 
Remember how it felt to be a child
Opening presents on Christmas mornin' 
That's the way that we should all feel now
So I say Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy
Holidays
