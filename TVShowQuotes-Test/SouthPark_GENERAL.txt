Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein.
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?
Alright men! Grab your guns and your Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks back!
All right, we might as well show it to them.  God-dammit, Tom.
Great job, troops! Once again we have killed our enemies!
So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!
That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam.  The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?
