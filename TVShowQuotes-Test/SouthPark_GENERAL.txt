That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam.  The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?

These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven.  Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons.

No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!

Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist!

We're coming, Miss Nicks! Hang on!

WHAT??

Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country,  Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?! 

Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.

What's going on?

That's true. You did.

All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books.

We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public.
