Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering!

What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!

Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called "Project Imagination Doorway."

All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!

You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!  I want that robot!

I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety! 

So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!
