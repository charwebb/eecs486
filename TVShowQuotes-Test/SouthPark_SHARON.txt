What? Oh my God.

Yeah. 

Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?

Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.

Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay.

All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?

Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo! 

Oooh, hi Dad.

Mmm, sounds good.

Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? 

Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.

What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?

It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw "Grease" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we-  Oh my God!

Right. 

Stanley??

Stanley, what did you do to Roy?

Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. 

He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.

Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.

Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.

Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.

Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.

Where are you going?

Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?

Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.

I gave her those tickets to "Wicked."  She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.

Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed.

It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh!  I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! 

Can we get out through the highway?

You just said the C-word!

Do me. Right here in the clubhouse. 

Ya think? 

My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!! 

Just go put it back in the trashcan!

Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.

I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!

Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?

What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!

I'm sorry, too.

What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me!

Randy? Where are you going? 

Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.

That's right.

Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. 

Yes!

Yes, you do!

What?

Randy, you've got to do something!

Well?

Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?

What the hell are you doing?

Oh my gosh, those poor people.

It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.

Stanley.  Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. 

Well, I guess it serves us right.  Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.

We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...

It's sexist, is what it is!

What's going on?

Language!

Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s.

Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?

What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!

That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.

Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.

What are you doing, sweetheart?

Stanley! 

All right everyone, eat up. 

You really should know better, Stanley.

We're watching the news.

Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.

All right, that's all of it!

What's going on? 

Oh wow.

Ugghh.

Well, I hope for his sake you're right. 

Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!

Oh, Stanley, where are you..?

Are you calling me ignorant?!

Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.

All right kids, dig in.

Randy, what are you doing?!

Yeah, our son has always been fairly clean.

No, mister, it's time for night-night.

Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!

Ready.

Good-bye, son.  Remember to eat right.
