Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?
...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there?
You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?
Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?
All right Randy, where are the car keys?!  Randy, where are the keys to the car?!  God damn it! 
Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?
So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!
"Your room is being serviced"? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?
Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.
Look! There's one of the boys now!  Jimmy!
You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.
Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woowhat what a surprise. Wwhat can I do for you?
I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.
What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel. 
Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.
Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
Every senior in town will be driving home...
Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.
Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!
Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.
He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.
What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.
What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!
Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 
I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.
We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.
I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.
You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.
