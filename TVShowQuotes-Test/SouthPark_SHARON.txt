Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!

Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.

O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.

Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!

Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?  Meet me in the clubhouse. 

Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: 

I don't really like working out in public.

That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!

Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.

No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.

Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?

Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!

We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.

Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.

I was. Can you help me unload the car? 

Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!

Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.

Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?

Okay, lemme see.  Oh, goody! You've got a fever!

We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.

Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again! 

You just gonna drink beer alone all day?

Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?

Oh I thought that note was for me.

Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.

Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.

Well then stop being an idiot and help!

Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are.

Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.

Give me that!  Stanley! This is your mother!

Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! 

Sshh.Hush little baby, don't say a word. Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' birdIf that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard

Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?

Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 

I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie.

Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.

Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.

You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.

I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!

Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-

Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?

Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!

No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you.

Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.

Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.
