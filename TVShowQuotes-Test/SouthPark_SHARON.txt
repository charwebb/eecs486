Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. 

Right. 

Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!

It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.

The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.

Randy, run! 

No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.

There you go. All set, sweetie?

Oh, that's great news! 

You're right.

Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.

Ohohh Randy, it's happening! 

All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 

I'll leave it up to your father.

All right everyone, eat up. 

Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim.

Come on! We don't have much time! 

A workout? Right now?

To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.

Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!

What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!

Well take it down. It's noisy.

Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo. 

Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?  Meet me in the clubhouse. 

I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.

Do you mean that?

Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.

Who are the experts? 

Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?

Don't be a smartass, Stanley.

I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

Okay, lemme see.  Oh, goody! You've got a fever!

Randy, you've got to do something!

What??

Because, we're divorced, Stanley.

Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?

Hahhh.

Oh I thought that note was for me.

Open this door, now!

Shelly, give your brother his ticket back!

You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?

Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!

Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.

You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!

Well, that's good, honey.

No, I'm good, thanks. 

Yes!

Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!

Randy...

We're watching the news.

Yeah...

Stanley. You?

My turn again.

Oh, alright, but take your grampy with you.

That was the right thing to do.

Turn it up.

What kind of job?

Stanley, I'm talking to you!

What should we ask him?

Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.

Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.

Diamonds.  They're beautiful

Well I don't know-

I didn't say anything.

Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.

Randy, what is all this? 

Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.

Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!

Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s.

Oh, no. 

Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?

Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.

Come on guys, lasagna's ready.

You just gonna drink beer alone all day?

He is. 

Yes. I just saw him.

Go Randy, run! 

Oh, are they nice people?

No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.

Ex-cuse me.

Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: 

...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there?

What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.

No, we are flushing the toilet right now-

Come on, Stanley! 

Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?
