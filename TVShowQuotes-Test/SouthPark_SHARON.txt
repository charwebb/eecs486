You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?
It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.
But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.
O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.
Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!
I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
He went with his friends to that music festival.
Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! 
D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!
You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!
It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!
What is it, Randy? Do you have any-  OH!  Randy!
Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan?
Then how do you know I blocked them?
I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.
Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. 
Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot.
Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?
What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.
Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??
...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there?
I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!
Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.
Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.
Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own?
Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken.
WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
What is it, honey?  My baby's killed again!
Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!
Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family.
We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.
Well, I guess it serves us right.  Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.
Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?
Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.
STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!
I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.
Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow.
