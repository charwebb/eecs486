You think your father's gonna listen to me?! 
Okay.  Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!
I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some.
Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan?
That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.
That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.
Stanley.  Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. 
Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!
My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!! 
Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up.  Go to sleep, Stanley! 
Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.
Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!
He went with his friends to that music festival.
I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
Well, I guess it serves us right.  Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.
Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing.
It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.
Of course not.  Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!
Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.
Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?  Meet me in the clubhouse. 
Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.  Stanley, did you see-? 
It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.
I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.
Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning.
And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.
You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.
Give me that!  Stanley! This is your mother!
Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.
We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.
Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.
Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.
Sshh.Hush little baby, don't say a word. Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' birdIf that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard
I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.
So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.
Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!
Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.
Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.
Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.
Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s.
