Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.
Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?
You know, a racist, but against people from the-
Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!
We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.
I just can't believe he would go without our permission!
Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.
Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!
You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?
I don't really like working out in public.
Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! 
It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. 
...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.
Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?
Oh, alright, but take your grampy with you.
Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.
Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.
All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?
Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.
Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!
There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. 
Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.
Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.
Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother.
Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.
Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.
Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?
Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. 
It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!
I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie.
Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?
All right, Stanley. I have had enough o-  Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? 
Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!
No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.
I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.
So, what are we going to do about our children?  Ahhh, hello-o?
I was. Can you help me unload the car? 
Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?
We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.
Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!
