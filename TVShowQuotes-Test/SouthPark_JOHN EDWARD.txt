I'm not talking to your friend and I'm not a douche!  You'd better get out of my house, 'cause I'm gonna call the police! 

I'm not a douche!

I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me?

And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a sad death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?
