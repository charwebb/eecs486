Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you.

Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. 

And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. 

It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here. 

I don't think I can do it, Phillip. 

Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check? 

What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.

Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!

Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.

How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." 

Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks! 

You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
