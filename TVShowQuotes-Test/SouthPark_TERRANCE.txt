Alrighty then, here's a two-lip. 

Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.

Ey! There's some anthrax over there! 

Ohohoho, nohoho! 

Look closer. 

My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.

Who!

Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. 

Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.

Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea. 

Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-  Caught you there!

That's the man's name?

I sure am cold, Phillip.

What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!

He sure did.

No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me? 

You're looking well.

Fart.

You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.

I Got Ya.

It sure is. Let's look for treasure.

I don't see anything.

Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.

Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?

Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'

We sure did, baby.  Next? 

Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure. 

Okay, here I come, okay.
