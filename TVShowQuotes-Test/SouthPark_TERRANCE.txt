Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
Huh, eh,  wait wait wait.  Eh, eh.  Here it comes, ehhhh.  Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!
The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.
Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being.  Good luck with your stupid little pig.
My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
Yes.  If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.
HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.
Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.
Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?
