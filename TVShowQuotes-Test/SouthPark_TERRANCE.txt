No, that was me, Phillip. I farted.

By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being.  Good luck with your stupid little pig.

What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!

Who?

Why?!

Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.

It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. 

Yeah.

Ohho God. 

No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me? 

Hello, and welcome to Progressive. 

Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.

But you ruined the whole show!

Alrighty then, here's a two-lip. 

But we're not gay, Phillip.

Ohhh, you farted. 

That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner.

SICK!

Hey Phillip! Pull my finger!  Aaaahahahaha. 

Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.

I Got Ya.

Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.

No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.

Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!

Ow, that's rancid! hahahahaha.

Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. 

Hey, Scott, you like apples?

But what do I get in return?
