Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
That's what I'm talking about!
I have plans later.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
Go, Dwight Jr!
You just said you hated it.
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
Yeah, Jim.
[Sitting outside building] Stop.
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
It was in the box.
No. Can't let you do that Mike.
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
Thanks, man.
Yep.
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
[answers phone] Hello?
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
[At Meredtith] Boo!
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.
Great.
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
You're not staying?
Oh, thank you.
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
You!
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
That was you.
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
Hey, man. Darryl.
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
What you need flour for, Jim?
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
That's what we need.
Unh! Damn it!
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
Close the door.
That's not a good reason.
Pick it up.
What?
Who cares?
Dunder Mifflin.
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
I didn���t realize we were this close.
Hey Mike, do my thing.
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
Yeah, we're going to get clobbered.
No.
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
No.
Yep.
And replay.
Who knows?
Yup.
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
Oh, what's up, Roy?
Union! Union, yeah.
Hey.
Yeah. You too, huh?
No.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
I know he loves his pick up truck.
You accept these terms?
It's real bad.
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
I don���t think I sh-
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
We good.
Right there.
Come on, be for real Mike.
You're not talking... triple digits?
That was a triple.
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
[holding camera] Here we go.
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
That's regular text talk.
Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let's do this!
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
That's your new standard.
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
Anybody?
Dwight?
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
Too late.
It's not a race.
I love Philly!
Your mom?
Don't go breaking my scale.
This is embarrassing, Michael.
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
That was definitely not dancing.
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
I... I just thought you knew me.
A book about oceans.
Yeah.
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
Okay, I'm not doing that.
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
I'm back together with Val. Yay...
We'll go after Darth then.
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
