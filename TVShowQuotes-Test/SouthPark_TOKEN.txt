That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.

Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. 

Yeah.

Well, I don't know.

Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. 

Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?

Who's Aslan?

What the-? Damn, baby. 

Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? 

How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.

Yeah.

Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home.

I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls. 

Okay...

Yeah, that turkey sucks.

But what are we gonna do?

This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!

Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.

No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead. 

You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!

Butters!

I don't know how to play bass. 

Aw, damn it. 

They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.

I can't believe it's finally over. 

No!

You're not?
