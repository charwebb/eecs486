Gary? Gary, say somethin'.  You killed him, you bastards! He didn't even want any part in this! This is all your fault, you stupid cow! You never gave your ol' Gary the time of day and now he's gone! Life ain't worth livin' any more! What's the use?! ...I'm comin' to see you, Gary!  I'm comin' to see ya!

Put it underneath me.  Slowly, mate, slowly!  Now back off.  All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button.  This is Oprah's minge!

Gary, what's, what's wrong?

What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!

Stay back, mate!
