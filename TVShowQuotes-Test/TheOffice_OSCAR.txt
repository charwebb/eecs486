What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
