Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
And that's how the printing press was invented.
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
You're not sure that you have the job.
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
I can help out, if you need me.
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
What time do we have to come in?
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
Do you know how to do an intervention?
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
