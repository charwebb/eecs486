Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
It starts on it's own. Let it -
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
