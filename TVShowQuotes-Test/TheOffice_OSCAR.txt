He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
What time do we have to come in?
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
