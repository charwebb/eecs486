[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
I think you don't know what you're saying.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
He literally won't come out of his office.
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
What time do we have to come in?
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
