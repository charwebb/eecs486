It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
I am dying to know what's in there.
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
It starts on it's own. Let it -
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
How long do you think a week is?
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
