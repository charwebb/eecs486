You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
You know what? I will take Comstock.
It was an amateur production, technically.
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
Actually I���m the electoral college.
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
Mmm.
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
How could anyone stand that woman?
Jim, you let Michael fall in.
You know the octagon sign means stop.
Yeah?
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
At least he is in the building.
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
Ah! My hand!  That's hot!
Dunder Mifflin.
No, I have not.
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
That's a lot.
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
Good night Andy.
Who is that?
Wow.
Kevin!
Role call.
Irony is such a critical...
Oh...
What if it were salads?
How would anyone even know--
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
Plus everyone would know who you meant.
Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?
Uh, nice party Michael.
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
And get you the hell outta that place.
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
Yes, she is. And clinically insane.
Done!
I think we can do it.
Are you? [leaves]
You're kidding. What was your DJ name?
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Bye.
State senator.
Yes, he's innocent.
Since Christmas.
Angela.
Pam, really? Come on.
Yep, here they are.
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
That's too funny.
I think the problem with this office is that
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
Okay. [walks away]
If you don't mind me asking---
You suppose?
Let me call you back.
Hey. Matt, right?
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
[whispers] Andy brought one too.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
Sure.
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
Good job Andy.
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
My mother's in a wheelchair.
Will you marry me?
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
She has to know.
But your mouth is ble���
El telefono.
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
[on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
Jan, he went running that way.
Because I'm gay?
[sees wine collection] Holy cow!
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Who is this guy again?
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
Here you go, Creed.
Stanley.
I got it.
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
Dwight. Hey.
Wow.
We can stay a little longer.
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim]
I have the chills.
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
Are you attracted to other men?
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
Is Matt around? I got his check.
Are you kidding me?
Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
Bulk or definition?
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
[nodding] I did. Yes.
No.
You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
Meredith!
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
I guess so.
You sound pretty defensive Michael.
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
I don't even wanna know these things!
I thought you were already engaged.
Hey, Dwight.
you are incorrigible!
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
I jus... I just need a signature.
Angela, you just were���
I never suggested...
Oh, Angela.
Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to..
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
