Andy.
This constitutes identity fraud.
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
���Three PM Girl���
Wow.
Dwight!
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Okay.
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
It's like a pay decrease.
Yes, yes, yes!
Just leave it how you said...
Because I don't want my benefits slashed.
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
Is that true, Toby?
There's no proof of that.
Okay. I'm done with this.
How many bottles? Three hundred?
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
I think it should be Darryl.
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
Yeah, it was.
No one else in this office is gay.
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
They're a descriptive people.
Yes!
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
I'm gay!
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
Argh!
I think there���s, like, $7 left.
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
No, it's fine.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
Forty-two.
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
Listen to this.
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
Thank you.
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Okay.
Oh, come on.
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
Yeah.
That's not.
I knew that, I knew it.
[clicks tongue] Aw...
What are you guys talkin' about?
Angela, you just were���
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
Actually, it's just-
Michael...
Come on Toby.
Last year, he walked 18 miles.
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
It's maddening!
Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.
It starts on it's own. Let it -
What are you doing?
A real David and Goliath story.
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
You have CDs?
Michael, this is a presentation tool.
Don't.
You know I don't like to participate in the...
Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
Hey.
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
[laughing]
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
That's gotta be tough.
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
It's a scoreboard.
I know.
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
[laughs] Mm.  Yeah.
Terrific.
Meaning what?
Per mile.
Just take her name off of everything.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
[buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
Michael.
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
Come on buddy, get back.
100 dollars.
Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
That's impossible.
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
Oh, he's plenty strong.
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Mmm...
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
Nuh uh.
Pam, I'm sorry--
[nodding] I did. Yes.
It's her first try.
Chicken marsala.
I forgive you for kissing me!
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
What? What?
Is everything okay?
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
So ten
You know the octagon sign means stop.
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
I can help out, if you need me.
Pam, really? Come on.
How can you live with yourself?
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Dwight. Hey.
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
