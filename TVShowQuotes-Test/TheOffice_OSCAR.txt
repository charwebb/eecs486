Hi.
Come on Michael. You can...
Maybe you're right, who are we to...
I'm in big trouble.
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
This is interesting.
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
No, Kevin -- [sighs]
Dwight. Hey.
I don't think so.
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
I can't.
Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
What are we, five?
Yeah.
Home is where the
Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
Hi, buddy.
Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?
Yes.
Why are you telling us this?
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
I think I'll just take my chances.
Andy. That is her private property.
Yeah, he's in a ladle.
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Um..
Who's the senator?
A triple word.
It's not that funny.
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
Dwight.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
Dumpster Man.
It was insane!
I'll make it. What are you drinking.
He literally won't come out of his office.
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
Ten percent?
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
It's fair.
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Ooh.
What?
Hey.
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
Oh.
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
Towards me.
Is everything okay?
How mean are we talking about?
No thank you.
Meredith, don't.
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
Michael, I don't know what to say.
Oh...
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
Which on in particular?
Ok
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
I'm asking about Certificates of Deposit.
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
Oh, that's very funny.
The one of all women?
So what do you think?
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
Kevin!
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
Oh my God, what happened?
Yeah, I feel terrible about it.
Do you know?
At least he is in the building.
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
Andy.
Ow! You hit people with that thing?
Just take her name off of everything.
Why'd you say dollars?
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
Jan.
[sighs] Oh my God.
Kevin, no.
We got it! Wow! We got it!
What is first base with Angela?
Dwight please!
Your office is full of genitalia.
Donate to the charity?
No kidding.
Well���
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
What are you guys talkin' about?
No, thank you, Angela.
What are you doing?
Why don't you just have an apple?
That's a lot.
My mom. [puts card in pocket]
What part Native American?
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
This is why I'm here?
Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
Thank you.
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
Still, that's not anything.
You're clearly snooping.
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
You're kidding. What was your DJ name?
How can we not watch this?
Where are you getting this information?
It's maddening!
I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
Just leave it how you said...
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
Kelly's on your side.
my dog Gerald is my life.
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
Yes, it is.
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
he's a historian.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
You call him!
[in phone] No, no. Finish the...
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
No, that's a flush.
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
What are you doing?!
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
I don't know.
Don't.
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
Salman Rushdie.
Can you believe this?
