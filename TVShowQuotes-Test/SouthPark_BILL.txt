Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit! 

I've been using the 12-step program for about two months now and, and I'm really turning my life around. No more blowing guys on Colfax Avenue for a pint of vodka for THIS cowboy! 

Check upstairs!  Upstairs clear! Try the office! 

You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  The Easter vigil will go on as planned!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!

That's gay.
