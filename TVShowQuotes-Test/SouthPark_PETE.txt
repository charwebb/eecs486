What the hell have they done to you?

Yeah. We just got Goth-served.

We aren't trying to be popular!

Uh, yeah, it kind of does.

Michael?! You here?

Not now, lady, we're really depressed.

Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. 

Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.

Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. 

NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! 

Oh my God, for two weeks?
