[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
[to Erin] How are the marks?
I thought it went great.
Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.
No, it's marijuana.
No, hmmm... that's still...
I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian
Michael.
Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
P.S. We should should kill him.
You are the master.
I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
Okay, I���m a woman. [high voice] I���m a woman. Good?
Pam, information is power.
Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
When is the guest of honor coming?
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
[straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]
K, I���m gonna need some help. Pam?
Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
I most certainly did not.
Dwight Schrute.
Diversifying. Smart.
Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
Everything's a joke.
You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.
Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
I could tell, from the body language.
Fax this for me.
But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Which we can't know.
Is that how they like to get in?
Oh really?
No.
Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Let's get back to work.
That's true.
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
A thousand times more.
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
Smells like it.
No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.
Yup.
Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
[Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
Ryan.  Come on, man?
You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
Yes..?
Oh, god, this again? You���re Stinky.
Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
[plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
Ok, what are they?
It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
Well, I did it too.
Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!
Not by a long shot!
It is warm feelings.
Oh, dear God in heaven.
No you do not.
Hmm. It wasn't here before.
I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
I���m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
Let's do it!
Dwight...
[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you���re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
[wails arms] You know, selling, typing, dialing.
He does? What does he say.
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...
My hip bone!
Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
What? Come on.
Here they come.
Oh, man, never thought I���d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.
So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
Did you even read the memo?
They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?
Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.
Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
Can I get you a tankard of mead?
Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
I want that vice-presidency.
Sheriff Pierce? I'm turning in my badge.
No! Michael, no!
My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
I haven't made a decision yet.
[sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]
Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
That is my stapler.
Okay, that is
And your veil.
Oh, Esther.
No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
No... way! Yeah!
Mmm hmm.
Don't leave us!
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
Aaaaah!
How close?
I just might be his father.
Yes.
Robert! Robert California! Robert!
No.
Michael, you know I can't take this.
For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
I don���t know, what do you mean?
Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Please?
Watch and learn.
Hello.
I'll get someone to take it down.
But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
You know what? You���re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you���re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
So sexy it becomes hostile.
Who was the second man on the moon?
You're so immature!
Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it���s barely three pounds.
Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
Yeah!
The city of Atlanta.
Packer.
Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
What?
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
You can't possibly be serious.
[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
Your own paper company.
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list]
And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.
Nash.
Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out.
You're the stupid one.
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?
Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]
[outside] Come on, hurry up you guys!
Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan]
I know how it happened.
Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!
[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.
[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!
I got floor.
Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?
You had black hair and then gray hair.
Ask him about the party.
Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
What?
[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
Next suggestion.
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!'
Okay.
Wha���Yes. Your attention. Uh because��� No that is all. [walks out]
Yeah! [laughing]
[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.
Oh, man, am I a woman?
They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like���not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor���
You've already been several times.
Go!
But you still work for Wired, right?
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
Very good.
Yeah, maybe I���ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it���s the most pleasant I���ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.
Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him!
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]
Store only has three employees.
It's close.
You know what this is?
I throat-rip.
Uh-huh.
You are kidding me!
You don't have email on your phone.
I started a fire with my cheese pita.
But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.
Sign it.
On a boat.
Obviously. I knew it.
Oh.  Meh.
He knew all along!
Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
What���s a book? [giggles]
Oh, no, no, no. It���s good. It���s really -- on the Internet, it���s a really -- that���s a really good, good, thing.
Sure thing.
Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
How dare you all attack him like this.
What are you doing?
[while everyone is gathered playing and singing ���Sons & Daughters���] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
She���s got a ton of great qualities. She���s young, she���s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we���re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn���t technically incest.
Kiyah!
Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
That is impossible.  Unless you mean gonorrhea.
Leave the keys.
Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
No women or children, unless provoked.
Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
Fosters in the big can.
Not! [scoffs]
Excellent idea, Pam.
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Really?
Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.
Speaking of pimples, let���s release the BLOGGERS!
You're insane.
You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
Michael, what time should I be arriving?
Get in the back.
No, no, don't, don't tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
You have to tell me.
Come on.
Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
Paranoid? I���m not familiar with the word. And I really don���t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
Exactly.
Do you want to die? OUT!!
Creed! Come on. Stanley!
That's not how it works.
I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
[wraps tape around Stanley���s body]
Are you referring to alchemy?
Robert.
You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
You liked it!
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
This interview is over. I'll let you know.
From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!
He used to fight dogs.
Are you calling me an idiot?
Its Jim and Pam, Michael.
Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
We're gonna bust this guy.
Let���s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
Hey.
Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?
[groans] Stop moving!
Really shove it.
Pshh. That's a bedbug.
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
I can't. I can't push harder!
Inventor of the cotton gin.
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
It's true. We all walk alone.
Are you laughing at me?
Give me it. I am not.
Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]
You already said deal.
Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
Not you, Erin.
It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
And flexible.
Ok, I'll punch you.
When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
[long pause] Crentist.
I would make sure that you were dead.
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
[lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
Come -- come with me.
I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
Yes?
You can't tantalize me.
[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
Waste of time.
You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
NO!
Now, Jim!
It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
Sure. That'd be fine.
[Shakes head]
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
[low] Oh God, here.
[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'
[attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah!
No.
My title has 'Manager' in it.
You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ���poisoned��� by Aunt Shirley.
You don���t need to repeat right now, when I���m saying it.
Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
A loyal, but bungling apostle.
What's the plan?
Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.
Your clients. They're all mine.
Thank you very much.
I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
You did?
Ha! I don't get it.
People who don't trust egg whites.
Dumatril!
Mmm.  [nods]
Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
Way to go.
What is your weapon?
It's that easy?
Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
Those who can't farm, farm celery.
Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
I'll stay for ten.
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
Welcome aboard.
Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
No.
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn���t even know it. I���ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
I was just showing her my belt.
I'll do it! I always say, 'You want something done right? Ask Dwight.' Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You���re gonna watch me right?
Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review.
We did it, we did it. I love you.
Really?
David. Can I just do one thing while you���re making this announcement and then I���ll never, ever do it again?
Wait, what?  You can't take what?
You should ask her out.
You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!
With this move, he can't get you.
Cocks in the henhouse.
[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
Can I be team captain?
Can I use your phone?
Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
Do it.  Promote me.  Tri-managers.
She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
I think you���re only a teeny���
[throws ���now��� beanbag at Jim] Now.
Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
I'm on it!
[spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah!
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
All right then. Someone propose a plan.
Look, I will not pay.
This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.
Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!
Yes.
Is this your car, Ryan?
You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]
Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
I���d love to be in the loop, David.
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]
Okay.
Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager���s office before?
Stop acting like an idiot!
Oscar.
Wait, I got it! Confirmation code: XV2RDM!
I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
Huh?!
Ohh.
No, you don't.
Seal it off.
Define foment.
...to consolidate power.
[on the phone] Oh my God!
Because you're engaged to Andy.
[agreeing] Mm.
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
I'm not familiar with that expression,
I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
[with a small fist pump] Yes!
STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
400 and one penny.
Damn it!
Drink it!
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
Remember?
Ha!
I have no way of knowing if that's true.
Hello? Hello?
[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
Hi Daryl. I���m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
Ok, let him know that I'm here.
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
Any brothers or sisters?
Uh, bumper's sagging.
Hello.
For what purpose?
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
I can see that happening, yes.
Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Yeah.
Why? I don't understand.
I don't want to do this.
[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
I had fish yesterday.
Should I get water or donuts?
No, you're not because I spent hours on it.
[talking over Michael] Yes.
I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
You said that?
So?
So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
May I please speak to your boss?
Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won���t be necessary tonight.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
How's it hanging?
It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
Oh no, it's broken.
This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
Really.
Yes.
I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim's hand and leaves]
Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
Oh my gosh, now she's up.
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
Sabotage.
Okay.
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
Yes.
What does it look like?
Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
And he made us all look like chumps!
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
[panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.
Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
Okay, hey, hey, hey...
Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
No, he shouldn���t.
It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
He defecated, aw.
Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.
What belt are they?
MIS... MI... What are you doing?
[handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts]
Ugh. I'm hanging up.
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.
Kung-fu movies!
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
That goes directly to the tester.
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]
He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
I'm not closing the door.
[standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement...
Don't you want a sheath for that?
Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don���t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that���s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
[confused] No.
[terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long.
Andy is complicating things.  But I'm not worried.  This will only up my game.
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
This conversation has two items on the agenda.
She had a hysterectomy.
A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
Then I refuse.
Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?
Oh.
So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-
There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
There's so much more to it than that.
[rolls eyes] Jim, come on.
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
What?
Hey shut up.  You're dead.
How much do you have?
[eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela's candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm.
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.
Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]
I demand more questions!
[Toby uses tester on wall as Erin marks wall with red tape X] Oh, god.
No, absolutely not.
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick]
I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
And not come through for you?
Don���t worry, it���s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It���s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
You can be so modest sometimes.
[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
I don't know.
What is the matter with... me?
Andy.
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
So, you--
No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.
[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?
Yes.
I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
Nice.
These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
Butter. Newborns are slippery.
You apologize to me right now.
Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
I think it was Creed.
--to use sudden violence.
700 and one penny.
Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
[applause] Oh yes! Yeah!
If you fall in love with her.
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
Hey.
Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
You���re welcome.
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
Okay. But it���s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can���t scrub worth a damn.
How ya doin'?
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you���re so smart. You���re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
Eel fishing.
They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
Toby.
Not now!
Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you���re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
Oscar is out sick.
[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
You haven���t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let���s go over membership. I���m going to need the first month���s and the last month���s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month���
Tell him to stop.
Come on. I'll drive.
Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
[shouting] Haulin' cube!
[looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.
You won���t stop until you���ve poached us all.
Yeah...
Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
Oh, I doubt you���ll make it. Very few do who���ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you���ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
That's bad.
What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.
One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
You���re telling me!
Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.
I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.
Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
Yes.
You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief]
And you didn���t call Jim - that seems significant.
What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
It is?
[enters main office, group claps] Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
Very close.
That doesn���t sound crazy, Jim. That���s the sanest thing I���ve ever heard.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]
[sobbing] Thank you.
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
I wish I could hire all of you.
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
Retaliation. Tit for tit.
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.
Marching or garage?
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
I don't ... have no idea.
Okay.
Hustle!
Accepted.
It's in Maryland.
What? Idiot.
It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
Oh, please.
I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
I���m trying, but what you���re asking is--
No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
Uh huh.
I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
I figured it would save time.
Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
[finds shoe box] Ooh.
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
[playing volleyball] Hit it Andy!
...noted.
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.
Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Okay.
It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
Done.
[picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall]
Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
Mmm. That���s a good��� question. 300 times��� [Jim hangs up] 180��� Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
Fine. Get outta here.
Yes!
Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
Please? Please, Pam?
Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
[gasps]Wait, the numbers!
Just a possibility.
Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?
It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
Nnnnn, that's not... okay.
Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.
Oh yeah?
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
100%.
Well���no, no���n���
I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]
What?
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
It did, it did.
[wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
What are you doing?
I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
Good luck, Michael.
Ryan.
[still typing] He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
