The tea in Nepal is very hot.
What?
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it���s in order? I [laughs] haven���t been trained for this.
Andy.
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
Oh, you weren't going to do that?
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
Mm-hmm.
Jim? Tell them what it's called.
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
Kelly! Great costume!
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
You mean, put me on the news?
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.
This fax came for you. [Coughs]
Yeah!  Let���s do it!
Okay.
It's Andy's fault.
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
Your two o'clock. [Danny enters]
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
Unplanned pregnancy.
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
One dance, all of us together.
From my secret admirer. That's you!
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
How is everything? How's your car?
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
That feels so good!
How was the dentist?
Really? Because your mother is dead.
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you���ve got mail.
Oh, I put those up.
They said the both of you.
Oh.
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn���t stop crying?
What about Kelly?
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Those posters used to be real French ads.
Let's do it!
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that���s the end of it. Right, Pete?
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
Thanks.
Why don't you like him?
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
I just said there isn't love.
Thank you.
He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
Pam, phone call.
Really?
I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
Like a benign tumor.
Whoo!
Jim...
Cool. Thanks.
Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Great.
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That���s what happened. The pens happened.
Oh.
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.
Nothing, I just-
No, I���m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
Phyllis!
See? I bet you wouldn���t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
Okay!
Probably from seeing that turkey.
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
[speaking in French] S���il vous plait���dites-Moi���Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
No, he's not making this up.
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
Yes?
So it's faster.
Uhhhh, they were engaged?
Sounds like a plan, Sugar.
Get out of here!
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
Good me too!
[shrugs] I've done it all my life.
Thank you.
[screaming upon seeing pumpkin-headed Dwight]
You have a very important call.
Sorry.
Hello.
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
Hey.
All that color.
A paper company.
Thanks, Michael.
Oh, guys, it���s starting! Hurry!
[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
Oh, my gosh!
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
[quietly] What?
Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
Dang it! What the heck already?
Okay.
[Laughs and shrieks]
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
Why was she in this building?
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
Geez louise.
You left us without saying goodbye.
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
Heyyy! Study buddies!
I would have chosen the 1490's.
Um,. it���s empty.
Hello.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
Game on.
Robert California. Let���s have a conversation.
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
Yeah.
Good morning, Meredith.
I care if
I hate your roof!
But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
Come on, don't you want to play?
Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
It was Andy, wasn't it?
