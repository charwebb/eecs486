Thank you so very much.

Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!

Duhhh!

Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.

And this is Precious.

Turd sandwich.

I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!

But I told you I was sorry.

Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.

Heheh.

No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!

Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!

Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.

Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 

I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.

I was just teasing.

All right, Stan. Sure. 

I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.

Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.

Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!

Or slip her the tongue.

What-evah! What-evah!  I'll do what I waunt!

O-kay, I'll- get on the bull.

You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.

Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.

Nice.

That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. 

Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!

You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. 

Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.

Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.

Hey dudes.

This isn't safe or fun!

Ham?

Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 

Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.

Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!

...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?

Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!

Nah! 

You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.

You're just gonna have to deal with that.

How much?

Aaagh!

Purity ring?

I'm doin' the best I can! 

Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.

Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.

God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! 

Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!

No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.

We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what "lost" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!

No, "uloveboobs." Lower-case u love boobs.

Somebody's baking brownies. 

How do you even know I'm here in my room?

Eh, shit...

Ow!

Man, that's crap.

You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!

Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?

Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 

You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry. 

Goddamnit, give me another chance!

Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!

That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.

Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.

What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!

I don't even know what that means.

Yeah, I think they're all ready.

Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.

Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.

I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.

We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.

Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.

Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!

Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?

Hello??

I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?

Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!

You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.

Yeah!

It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 

What?

Butters, what the fuck?!

No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.

Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.

I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!

The Germans again?

YOU SICK BASTARD! 

Okay. Okay okay. 

Wow, cool!

Argh! 

All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. 

Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. 

God damn it, lazy-ass whore. 

Oh-HO, grohoss.

Dude, Craig, we should go back now.

Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.

Later's fine.

I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.

O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?

Well well well! 

I told you! Jawas have no heart.

But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.

I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.

Dude, this TV show is awesome.

Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 

What?

You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 

Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me. 

Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!

I am not!

Yes I do!

What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?

Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.

What the hell?! This game's all boring now!

No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.

Son of a bitch!

My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.

Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?

Oh God!

Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!

Oh, bitch!

Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.

Yeah they fucking did Kyle!

Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.

Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!

No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.

Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.

Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.

Are you talkin' to me?!

You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!

Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. 

Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 

What did I do?!

Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!

Right now?

Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!

What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.

Lame!

Yeah! This is so tits!

Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?

Dude, people are pissed off at us.

Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 

I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.

God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!

Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-

Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!

But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!

Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! 

Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.

Right.

And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?

Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!

Jesus Christ!

How?

Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 

Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! 

Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.

Oh, son of a bitch!

Dude! 

Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. 

You're goin' with Christ! 

Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?

Ball. Balll. 

Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 

The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!

You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.

Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...

I don't wanna.

Did somebody say "catch a Jew"? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.

Hey, take it easy Colonel.

Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. 

Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. 

Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!

Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!

Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!

Not yet, but they will be.

Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.

For one tooth.

Kind of.

Hooray!

Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!

Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. 

Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!

Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!

I'm not fat, Kyle.

If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!

You sold the movie rights to who?!

Oh, thanks Jimmy

I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!

Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!

What the hell is gluten?

Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.

That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!

That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?

Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that?  Who's laughing?

We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!

For what?

Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.

Because, Butters, I'm... dead. 

Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.

Stan?

And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.

They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!

Finally!

It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!

And you! I should never have believed in you!

Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?

It is not!

Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.

Goddammit, NEXT!

Eating Kenny's pudding.

Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!

Well... well then he's NOT alive.

Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.

Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?

The Russians?

Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!

Pretty sweet, huh?

Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! 

There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.

Haha. 

Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!

Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.

I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying "No, I'm big-boned" or "no, that's just muscle"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.

Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.

No it isn't.

Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.

Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.

Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!

Mom, drive faster!

You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!

No gay speeches, Kyle!

G'night, guys.

Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!

Eat my underwear?

Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.

I told you this would happen. 

You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.

You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!

You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!

Yeah!

Okay, Kenny, what does "fingerbang" mean, then?

Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 

Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!

Told ya!

All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. 

I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!

Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?

Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.

All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 

Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"

Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!

Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.

Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!

Huh?!

...play stupid games.

Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!

I'm dying of boredom.

Because he was a great person, Kyle.

No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.

Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!

Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!

Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!

Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?

I got reports that the suspect is in this area!

Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!

Come on, come on!

Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. 

Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! 

All right Craig! 

I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called "I Was Not The Bullet." 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
"Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?"
I was not the verdict.

Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!

You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!

Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?

I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!

No! Kyle can't die. 

What's this?

Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.

But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?

We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!

What?

And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.

Why would you tell anybody?

...So? I'm half bisexual!

Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.

Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. 

I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. 

I don't know.

Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.

Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, "Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!" 

Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.

The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!

Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-

We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.

Should be fine.

Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?

Oh boy!

I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. 

Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.

Kyle. What's your name? 

Cut the crap. You got the stuff?

Yeah, now get out of here.

Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.

Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!

...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!

North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.

Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!

Eh- ...what?

You guys can't scare me!

You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, "I Hate You Guys":
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
I hate him the most.
Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys. Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny.

Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.

I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! 

Aaah! Aliens! 

I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!

Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 

You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?

Four dollars. 

Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?

Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. 

Are you fucking with me?!

All right, Bebe, let's see the list.

Yes!

There you are, Butters!

Right... 

You're straight like a freeway!

Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!

Oh, this should be good.

Yeah! This was our hot lead!

Es ist Zeit für Rache!

Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! 

Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot pourri, and queazies

I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!

That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!

No sign of forced entry.

Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.

Oh never mind.

Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!

Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. 

Jews...

B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.

Bitch, I hate that bitch!

All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.

Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.

The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!

You're damn straight, he did.

You guys, shit...

Better.

Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control! 
I love to singa
About the moona and June-a and the springa
I love to singa
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...

No, not when money is involved, stupid! 

Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.

YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??

Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.

Yes! Praise the Lord!

I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.

Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?

Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!

You guys! You guys! Look! 

Ey!

By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.

I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes.

Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. 

Argh!

Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.

Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.

Mom, I wanna go home!

Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! 

Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!

No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. 

They can't make money. It's against the rules.

Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.

But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!

No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!

Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!

Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.

Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.

There he goes again.

So...  are we cool?

Awwwwrrr-auugh. 

Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!

Mom?

YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!

Ahhhhhhhhh.  Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.

Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.  Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?  Well, screw you too!  What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?! 

Now you sound like white people!

You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 

Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? 

Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.

Huh, I think God has plenty of money.

HA! What a dumbass! 

Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.

Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. 

I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.

We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 

Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!

Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!

What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.

Got it! 

Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 

How?

Huh-who's Romper Stomper?

I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.

He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! 

Wait, hang on Butters!

Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.

Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.

Fuck you! No I don't!

Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!

I think Towelie is awesome.

Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 

Here. 

Screw you, hippie!

Gross dude! 

You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!

There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! 

Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.

Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.

Bill Clinton.

No, because the aliens erased my memory!

I can be forgiven?

We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies…

What?

Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.

Seeya.

(looking bored) Fags!

It was a... a warm spring morning. 

No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 

Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.

Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! 

Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch. 

Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!

Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!

He has a point.

Come on, you guys!

I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.

Okay let's, let's try this one.

We'll roshambo for it!

Hngh, totally.

Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.

...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--

Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. 

I can't! Don't you understand?!

Huh? You comin'? 

I am not swimming around in pee!

He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!

You guys, get me down from here!  Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!

Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.

Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.

How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK! 

That looks pretty good.

No more Salisbury steak and… pecan pie. 

My God...

No, and fuck Kyle!

Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.

She said it again. 

Oh yeah, I see it. 

You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!

¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!

That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!

Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.

Yeah dude!

Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.

Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!

Excuse us!

And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!

Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!

Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 

You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!

No, you guys. This is virtual reality.

That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?

Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!

Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry.

Butters, is that you?

No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!

Ey!

Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.

Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! 

Quit it, mom!

Oh, fuck my ass! 

Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!

Just make the boat go that way, kind of.  That's good. Now bring her around portside.  Now that's a pirate ship!  A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves?  Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around.  A round of grog for me boys!  A round of grog for everyone!  The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys! What kind of pirates are you?! Look at yourselves! You disgrace the Blackbeard! I don't know where you people get off calling yourselves pirates!  Little beat-up boats, water in Dixie cups. I mean, I mean look, look at this guy!  Look at this guy for Christ's sake!  I mean, how hard is this, people?!   I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!
Weee drink and we pillage and we do what we please! We get all that we want for free!

Okay.

Aah, three dollars.

Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?

Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.

Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.

We don't care. *urp*

Who the hell are you?

I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! 

That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.

This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. 

The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.

I know that!

Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.

I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!

It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.

...play stupid games.

Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.

We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.

Goddamnit, you just can't-

Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!

He took it pretty well.

If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.

Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!

My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song 
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do

Yeah. 

You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. 

Racist! 

Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.

That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. 

AAAAAHT!! 

They better not!

Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?

I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.

Standing right here, let's go, bitch.

I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.

Yeah, it's pretty good.

Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! 

I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!

Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. 

I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?

Hey!

You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!

How to get Scott Tenorman back!

Fluffy!

What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? 

Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!

Yes, of course. 

Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.

Dude, I'm takin' a break.

Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 

Cool.

There's a bunch outside my house too.

You did?

Yeah, me too.

But it's the only way for us to be happy. 

Token, calm down.

I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.

You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!

Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?

Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!

Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!

Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.

Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!

All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?

Take it easy, Conner. 

All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!

Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 

Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. 

Guys... Uh... Uh... 

I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...

Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.

...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.

Kenny's got it. heh heh.

Can't I? 

You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
"Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!"
Ah whatever, Kenny! 

You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.

Jesus Christ!

You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!
Excuse me?

Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.

Really?

Eehh, shut up.  Ooohhh, yeasss.

It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.

Who? 

He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!

How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 

All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.

I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.

It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!

All right McNuggets!

Aaahh! 

CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?

Amen.

Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!

Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!

Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.

Are you Teabag?

Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?

It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...

Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.

Not so fast, Kyle.

God this sucks!

Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.

God, I hate old people!

What? Tell us?

Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! 

You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?

No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.

Motherfucker! 

Wow, cool!

Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!  Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!  You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!  Planetariums suck ass! 

Noo!! Nooo!!

Good! Did you kill him? 

I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!

Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!

Oh no??

Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?

With what?

Thank you. 

What, what is it? What is it for?

Shut up, you guys.

Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

Yes?

What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?

Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 

You guys have to help me!

We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.

Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.

Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 

Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! 

What do you have in mind?

No way, you got weapons too?!

Yeah. I think we get along okay.

Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.

All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! 

Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!

Yeah!

My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.

This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!

Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!

Nooooooo!

He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 

Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. 

Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? 

Ahh, son of a bitch!

What?

This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!

Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.

Look, a covetous Jew!

Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!

Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. 

Testing, testing, 1 2.  Sweet. 

Red Power!

So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. 

OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?

My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 

Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!

I can shoot you too!

Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.

Yeah, ham.

Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.

My password is uloveboobs!

Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!

Hey, I was just about to do it.

That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!  I said, "You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!" 

God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!

Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.

Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...

Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?

Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?

This will only take a second.

I don't know, but you're the only one who can.

I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.

Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!

God, I hate you so much, Stan!

We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!

HA! Saving money, duhhh! 

Cheer up? I'm half ginger!

Nothing.

Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!

I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.

Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.

Who the hell cares?!

I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! 

Choo-choo train.

I am here... to teach you calculuuus.

Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?

Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.

A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.

Roll camera!

I want my Mo-omm 

No. 

And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 

Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.

Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! 

Huh?

Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 

You're not ugly.

All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!

that's why they're lame. 

You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!

Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.

Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! 

All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail" 

Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?

Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??

Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.

...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--

We're screwed.

The black and brown people.

Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.

I'M GINGER!

Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.

Me, too!

Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!

I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 

Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.

Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?  Hey!

That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!

Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?

Don't stress about it or you just might faint.

Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!

Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?

Coming, Mom.  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!

Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.

Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.

This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.

I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!

It's an emergency! It's an emergency!

It is?

Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!

Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.

You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.

I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.

And what exactly keeps me on the stool?

I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...

I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.

Not really...

Yeah, screw them!

Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!

AY!

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!

I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.

We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!

I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.

Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. 

Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. 

And we're White.

Aunt Jemima. 

Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?

You guys, we've gotta stop it!

Nuh-uh.

The Germans?

My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.

Okay, let's go, Jew! 

Since when?!

This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.

Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. 

Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.

What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.

There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. 

Yup!

What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken?  Ugh! 

Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?

Threatening all of us!

Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!

Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!

Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.

You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.

No, gallons.

Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.

Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! 

Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!

Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!

Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.

Westsa-eed-eh.

...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 

No I didn't. That was just my shoes.

Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. 

It's the greatest startup company name EVER! 

Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 

Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?

Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. 

that's why they're lame.

You're last, dude! 

Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?

So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!

Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.

Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?

Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.

Wheh? Where am I?

Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?

Bull's eye!

You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!

Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?

No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!

Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.

You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.

Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.

My penis is 13 inches long.

I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?

Heheheheheh heheheheheh.

Whoa.

No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.

Aw donkey balls...

Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!

You're acting like a bunch of assholes!

Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! 

Yeah, well I don't see why-

What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!

This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.

Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! 

Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.

Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it! 

I swear, Kyle. 

Uh oh! 

Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!

Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?

Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.

Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.

I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously. 

Here, check 'em out.

I know!

You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!

And what was that purpose again?

Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?

No, you didn't.

I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. 

Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.

Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. 

Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. 

Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.

Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.

Psych!

Ugh!…Hey! I'll kick your ass! 

You can make it stop!

I know, right?  "Who is the Coon?" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.

Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?

That's right! You stay out!

Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?

Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.

He's not a fag!

Who is there?

The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 

YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!

I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. 

God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.

Noooo...

You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!

That was awesuhome!

Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!

She bought it.

He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.

Yeah, who has cats these days? 

Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"

Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! 

You know what I'm talkng about!

The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?

Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 

You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see

Hey!

Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!

Good job Ike! 

Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?

They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.

Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!

Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! 

I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!

Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-

Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.

You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.

Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.

Zap him again!  Do it!

Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.

Really? How big is my file?

Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.

Touché, teacher. Touché.

Aw dude, that's our town!

Yeah. 

Deah, eh eh.  Oh man, what a weird dream!

What does it want?!

Hmmm, no.

What the hell's wrong with Clyde?

Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.

Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 

You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!

Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 

The one tape must be returned!  Run! 

Why don't you make me? 

How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?

Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.

Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?

Is nice?

NOOOOOOO. 

Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.

You interrupt people when they talk.

That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.

Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!

Really?

Fuck you!

Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?

Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?

Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.

Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!

...But Mo-o-om, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!

I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.

Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!

Well, there's a whole crappy band here!  Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? 

Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.

Naaaa! Daaaaa!

...well Token doesn't know that.

Wow, she's pretty.

Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.

He's faaahn.

I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 

And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 

Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! 

So... so then, how can you feel bad?

Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.

Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.

No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!

I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.

Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.

Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.

No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! 

GOD DAMMIT!! 

On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "You-hoo"...

Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!

Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!

Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents.

Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?

...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.

Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.

Who?

Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.

Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.

Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.

Denver Nuggets game?

We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.

Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?

Okay, let me have it.

Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!

...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!

Oohhhh!

Oh man, that was soho awesome!

Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.

Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!

Hello, Scott!

Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!

Ow!

Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!

It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!

Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?

Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 

...What?

I rest my case.

Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?

Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 

Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?

Why not?!

Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. 

Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?

Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!

Uh-oh.

Nothing!

You wanna be my friend?

Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcake!

I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!

My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.

Well what?

Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! 

No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!  You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!! 

I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!

Holy crap!

Oh no. Oh NO!

I said I will only talk to the President!

Hah! Hey!

Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!

Good. Again.

Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.

Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?

God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!

AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.

Damn his Goddamned authorituh!

Step back! Tell those men to step back!

Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!

Kevin, Goddammit! 

Freeze! Put your hands in the air!

Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  "Super... Phun Thyme."  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!

You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.

Maaaa. M-maaaa.

Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
