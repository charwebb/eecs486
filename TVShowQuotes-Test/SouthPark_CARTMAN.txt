Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 
...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--
-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.
Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 
Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. 
Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game , and that Power Jim doll.  And, let's see...  Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?
What happens if we win the State Championship game?
No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! 
It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. 
Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?
Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! 
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
I said I will only talk to the President!
Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!
KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! 
Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! 
Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. 
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."
Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' "Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that."  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.
You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. 
Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
Well, I saved you all the chicken part. 
There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!
Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! 
We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read "1984"?
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 
So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 
No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?! 
Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.
He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that?  Who's laughing?
Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. 
I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. 
Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
I love you guys.  Ah, screw you guys(!)
Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
It's all CartmanBrah now.  I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender.  Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!
How come the outline is missing its hand?
Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on "Saturday Night Live"?
It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! 
I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"
Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap!
My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 
Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.
Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 
...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll roshambo you for it! 
No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.
So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever!
Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!
That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. 
I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?
Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.  Eeyy, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." 
What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
How do you even know I'm here in my room?
Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!
And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!
Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.
Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
The torso he would dump into the lake. 
Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"
Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.
Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  "Hi. I'm eight and a half inches." Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?
Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…
All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! 
You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
No hey ut what, what I meant to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 
They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
What, what is it? What is it for?
We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.
Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? 
Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).
Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?
Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!
Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being such a great role model for me.  Piece of crap.
Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? 
Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.
Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?
Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 
Oooh, Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...
It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 
Ready. I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-laI hope my will enjoy my danceFiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ayWould you like some sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!
Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 
Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 
You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 
And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 
Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!
Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! 
Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?
Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.
Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 
Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!
No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!
Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 
Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 
That's right, I did!You guys are hella stupidYou guys are hella lameYou guys are hella dumbHella hella hella!
You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!
Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks
and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
He said you kissed her with your tongue.
Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 
It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say "I don't blame the white people. No no no!"
Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!
Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.
Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. 
No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 
Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
Oh dude, I just got the best idea
All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. 
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! 
Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?
Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.
You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke!
Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?
Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.
Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! 
Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
God, I'm glad you guys know all these "pooping outside" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.
Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk
Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! 
Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!
Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!
They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!
No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. 
No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
I have the power to have all the powers I want.
Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 
Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. 
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."
No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?
Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!
No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 
You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! 
Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!
Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
Dolphins, eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!
...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!
Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions.  There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. 
That's fine, just get it out of the way...
You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! 
Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a "lahty do" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the "lahty" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second "yo ho". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? 
You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!
You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 
Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-
Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about "Greased Lightning."  You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-
THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here.
Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!
Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams. 
Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!
Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! 
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!
Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 
Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.
Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!
Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!
Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.
It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
There's even World War Three to look forward to.
You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. 
No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! 
No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 
Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddam son of a bitch!!
Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
Well.  Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 
Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stand and Kyle" song?! Ahem.I hate Stan and KyleI seriously hate Stan and Kyle...
I can't go with you guys right now.
Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?
Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! 
You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
"That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."
Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez.

They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.
Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a biiig present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.
Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 
I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."
I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah
Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! 
It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
It puts the lotion back in the basket!
Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! 
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 
I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 
The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! 
Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!
If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.
We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. 
No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?
Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!  I'll see you later at my house.
Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.
And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 
Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?
Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!
No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!
