So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!
I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! 
What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
"Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 
You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??
Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot pourri, and queazies
Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.
Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! 
Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...
All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 
Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip! 
Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! 
Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!
Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?! 
Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 
I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?
You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age, wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside.Wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Frog Polly Prissy Pants go down to...
Well... mm-Rumpertumskin.
Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.
Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. 
No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!
Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. 
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.
Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 
Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 
You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! 
It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
I only need one, dude. I only need one.
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.
I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. 
Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?
So there is no war now in the future.
I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 
I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95! 
Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. 
Oho yes! I did it I did it!
I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 
I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
So who do we throw the party for?
For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.
Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 
No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?
You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? 
Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song! 
You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
You don't think we're any good, do you?!
Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 
For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? 
You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 
Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.
But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!" 
Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
He's a little wuss, what's it look like? 
Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddam son of a bitch!!
I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
All right, hit one out of the park!
Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 
They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 
Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"
Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? 
Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 
You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 
Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... "Do you like fishsticks?"
That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
Monday she's a bitch, 
on Tuesday she's a bitch, 
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different, 
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!
Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
I will! James West, cowboy and rap star!  Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!
The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?
Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.
I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 
Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 
And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!
There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 
But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!
No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time." When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.
Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"
Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: "I mis-interpreted the rules." It's what you must also say when caught cheating! "I mis-interpreted the rules." Say it with me.
Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?
Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 
Hey, hey, what's going on?!  Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
Oooh, Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...
Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! 
Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.
Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!  Take that, hippie! 
Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.
Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! 
You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..
Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!
Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?
And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! 
You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 
Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.
Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.  Eeyy, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 
No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 
Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states "benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being." I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 
Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! 
Huh? First graders?  Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!
Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 
You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 
Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."
Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. 
Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. 
Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?
Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.
Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? 
Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. 
I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! 
Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!
Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"
Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!
Could you turn up the heat just a little?
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? 
The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. 
Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider!  Bang! Bangbang!  Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang!  We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch... 
Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. 
Now, are you a team player or not?!
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!  Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! 
We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.
Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix! 
We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. 
Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! 
It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.
There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! 
Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on. 
Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!
We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! 
Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 
Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! 
These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. 
Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. 
We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! 
My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
What is this? Halt!  It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 
All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!
O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.
Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 
What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! 
Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
'"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink."' 
Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?
He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!
Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, damnit!  AAAAH! 
Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 
Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!
Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 
Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
You scared the crap out of me, Ike!
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest.  God damnit, there's no more Pengins!  Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. 
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. 
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! 
Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?
Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.
Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! 
You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! 
Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, "Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!" and I smack him on the head!
She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!
Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! 
I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
The torso he would dump into the lake. 
I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 
Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?
Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 
No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! 
I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. 
This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 
Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what "lost" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW!
