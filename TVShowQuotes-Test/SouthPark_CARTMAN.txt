Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?
Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.
Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!
So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?"
This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional champsionship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?  Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?  Apparently, only I do.
It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. 
Avast!  These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.
Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my-  Aha! There's a king croc right there!  And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-
No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him. 
Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 
That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful."
Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!
But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. 
Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! 
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. 
No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.
Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. 
What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream...  Oh, that did it.
Eh-- 
For I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to us this song of hope
And this is what they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.
I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.
Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.
I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. 
So there is no war now in the future.
You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!
Damnit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!
You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 
You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 
Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?
Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. 
Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 
Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
Oh, well, I'll just take that, then.  And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?
Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! 
What, they already have something better than Twitter?
Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 
I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!
Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 
Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. 
Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. 
That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. 
Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!
That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? 
Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.
Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again!  She's on my back! Hah! 
Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
I said "Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!"  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?
But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 
Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!
I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 
Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 
Like find out where Mrs. Streible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. 
Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come? 
He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about- 
Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
"Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 
Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 
No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.
Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! 
It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 
See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being such a great role model for me.  Piece of crap.
Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. 
Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 
Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?
We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 
Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
They can't make money. It's against the rules.
It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 
They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.
Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 
Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. 
"An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does that mean?
Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. 
We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!
Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 
So that's what this has all been about?
Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh!  You get out now and respect my authoritah!  Ow! 
That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah! 
Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 
Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?You guys are my best friendsThrough thick and thin, we've always been togetherWe're four of a kind, havin' fun all dayPallin' around and laughin' awayJust best friends, best friends are we.I love you guys. 
Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! 
Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!
Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.
Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...
All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.
You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--
Okay, that's enough fatass jokes for this week.
Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! 
Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.
You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 
No need. I have one for you right here. 
Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! 
I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 
Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 
Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the-  What the hell's going on?
Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
So what happens when the dragons show up?
Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!
You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.
Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too? 
Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.
It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .
I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? 
Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
I want to know where I came from.
It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 
When is this going to be on the air?
Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!
I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 
They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. 
There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!
Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 
And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?
... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 
I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! 
Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?
I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.
No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and...
But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. 
Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. 
Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 
No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 
Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?
Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. 
I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. 
KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!
Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. 
I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.
What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! 
"To Douglas." There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! 
Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 
Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! 
What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? 
That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!
I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 
He's a black kid that goes to my school?
All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! 
Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.
Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! 
I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here
I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called "daywalkers." 
I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?
We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
"Yes I do, you guys."  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. 
...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 
No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.
That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 
Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?
Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. 
When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit! 
Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 
Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 
Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!
Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. 
Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
Hey!  I'm taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.
Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!
Now how the hell did he do that? 
Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
What the hell is that supposed to be?
You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.
Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! 
Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.
Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!
Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.
Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.
This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! 
Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh. 
Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you.  Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them. 
Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.
Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! 
Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. 
Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. 
Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 
Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. 
"Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!
I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!
Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 
We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.
Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!
I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.
My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah? 
Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. 
Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. 
You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!
Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?
Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 
All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 
Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.
Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 
Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 
You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. 
I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...
Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.
Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!
Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...
No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. 
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 
Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...
Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? 
But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.
Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.
We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.
Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! 
Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. 
Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! 
...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! 
Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 
Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!
Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--
Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!
Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
Come on. Come on.  Come on. Oho, this is so sweet!  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!
Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!
...But Mo-o-om, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.
I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .
Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! 
We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.
Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 
Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail" 
And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!
You don't think we're any good, do you?!
Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.
It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
Kyle no, seriously.  No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I…Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.
But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!
Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  "Hi. I'm eight and a half inches." Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?
Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
Your gift of hope is a great deduction. 
Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!
All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 
Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.
All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.
Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 
Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! 
Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? 
If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.
That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! 
Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 
What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. 
God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!
Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... 
"Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."
