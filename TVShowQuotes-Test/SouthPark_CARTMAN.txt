Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? 
Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.
Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! 
Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest.  God damnit, there's no more Pengins!  Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. 
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! 
And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!
No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?
Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 
If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?
They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. 
Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk! 
Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
They mostly come at night, mostly.  Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!
All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
Well, where is it?  What the hell is that?!
Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
O! At least I have as ass, Jew!
Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that?  Who's laughing?
How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 
All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! 
There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 
You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 
Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!
Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! 
Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?!
Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
"Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?
I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.
We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!
Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.
Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here!  My Speak and Record bear. Of course.
Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 
What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
Really?  Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.
How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? 
Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.
Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
"Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson." 
"My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?
Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?
Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.
Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 
We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 
Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!
Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!
Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 
Look, I have to have one of those phones!
Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f- 
Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 
I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! 
Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!
But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? 
Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 
Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. 
Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
Oh dude!  Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?
I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.
That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 
Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. 
So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. 
Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! 
It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
Full cheeks!  Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! 
How could you know anything about who my family is?
What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. 
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?"
You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. 
This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 
Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
We got him! I know where he is!
No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 
Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?
I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?
I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!
How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
You're-you're a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool.
Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. 
Yeeh, stealth bombers  Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-
All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. 
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.
Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.
All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!
I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. 
You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. 
Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?
...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! 
Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. 
The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. 
Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 
Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!
There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! 
Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. 
Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on. 
I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
"To Douglas." There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? 
Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! 
We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
"It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome."
I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! 
Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
I guess we gotta go back to school. 
Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! 
Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 
Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn 
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto
Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. 
The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!
Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
I have never been a dick to you.
You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 
Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 
Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 
...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. 
You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?
Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 
Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 
Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! 
It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. 
It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.
Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!
Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 
Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 
Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 
Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation." 
No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"
No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!
Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!
Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 
There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!
Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 
That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh 
You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
What, they already have something better than Twitter?
Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part?
This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 
Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with
Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.
Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.
You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!
Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. 
Okay, that's enough fatass jokes for this week.
Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  Brown eye! 
Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 
Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! 
I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 
My potty? What are they going to do to it? 
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. 
Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 
Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 
Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.
This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. 
Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? 
Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair, 
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BI-I-I-ITCH - aahh.
Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! 
Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 
All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.
Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being such a great role model for me.  Piece of crap.
I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.
How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.
Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.
"Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?
Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
Heh, he's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
"An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does that mean?
Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!  Ow. 
This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!  Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!
I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! 
Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!
Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." 
...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!
Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams. 
Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 
Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.
JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 
Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! 
Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?
Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 
Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 
O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.
Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. 
I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!
Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?
Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-
Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! 
But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  "The Old Man and the Sea" for us. Comprende? "The Old Mand Y La Mer".
Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.
Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
No need. I have one for you right here. 
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.
All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--
