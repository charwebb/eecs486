Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  and 800 points. 

Hi, Grandpa!

Hello hello, are you still there?

Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!

Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.

The present.

Well, hi there.  Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?

All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?

Post-season?

...What?

Heeeey! 

Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.

But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?

Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!

You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- 

Parents? Parents?!  Oh God! 

Sweet. I think we're next in line now.

Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.

I know, it sucks. 

Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!

You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.

Dude dude dude! Check it out. 

Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.

Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 

He's lying, dude. Hit X

We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.

Got it! 

W-yeah, of course. 

Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!

Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.

Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.

Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 

What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.

Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!

Whatooya mean?

Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!

Cucumber in the pants. Got it. 

I'm a little piggy.

Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.

Wha?  What are they?

Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. 

AWESOM-O understands.

Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!

Mom, drive faster!

Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.

Food! I have to have food! 

Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.

I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!

No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!

The Germans?

There we go, Saright?

No- nooo.

Dude, it was complete brutality!

Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!

Who the hell are you?

Fine! That's fine. 

God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!

He-hey, that's my money!

Ha! Hahahahahaha

I care! Where's the closest toy store??

You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?

A turd sandwich.

Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?

Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 

Stan, what the hell are you doing?! 

Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is. It's inside my shoe. 

Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 

Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?

Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!

Nice.

I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.

Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."

Meh. 

...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 

Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! 

Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!

Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!

Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.

Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?

Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.

Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!

It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?

Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?

All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!

All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.

Ugh, ugh!

Sweet.

Now walk, Timmih! 

Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 

Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.

All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.

Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f- 

...65, 66, 67... 

You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??

No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.

So long, Kyle!

Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!

Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 

Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.

I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.

Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.

Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.

Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.

Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.

Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!" 

Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.

Stop cheating, Craig! 

...No way.

He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?

Thanks, you guys.

So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.

What did you say?!

Got it! 

Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!

Holy crap! 

How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?

Who let-?

God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!

Yeah they fucking did Kyle!

Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!

Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.

Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 

You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.

Aw, Mom!

Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!

Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.

Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.  You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad. 

It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 

Jakov, please don't go.  You make everything in South Park fun.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.

T, H. "Th." There. Hey, this is easy!  I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!

Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!

Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 

My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.

Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 

Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! 

Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.

Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.

There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.

Nothing!

...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!

I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 

Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!

Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 

Huh? First graders?  Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!

Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.

KFC!! 

And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say "Es ist Zeit für Säuberung," you all chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."

Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!

Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?

Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.

Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!

Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!

Yes!

No! You wiped them all out!

I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?

Red Power!

No! We still have to fight!

Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!

All right!

I told you this game was sweet, dude.

Sucky-sucky, five dollar.

Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!

Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!

Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.

I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 

Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!

Oh, well, I'll just take that, then.  And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?

Now say it again, louder.

—Christmastime is presents for me.

Poor people tend to live in clusters.

Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!

Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!

You have AIDS?

Butters, are you there?!

Yeah.

Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.

Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.

Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.

No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.

You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!

For everything bad I've ever done?

Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 

Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.  Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!

Oh, dude, here it comes!

Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her! 

You know we might not even make it into the studio.

All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! 

Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.

Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! 

Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.

Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!

Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.

Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 

Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.

...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.

Fucking gross!

That's right.

I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!

Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!

Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. 

Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.

I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!

I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!

It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.

Sweet.

You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party

Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 

Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??

What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!

Oh! You fucking bitch! 

Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!

Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee

She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...

Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door.

Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 

Alright. Why don't I have pinkeye then?

Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.

Ironic how?

Fuck 'em!

Turn it off dude!

Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!

Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.  Oh, man!

Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.

Reverse to you, Jew. 

Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.

Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 

I do, I love my country!

I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?

Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... 

AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!

Sweeet!

Ay! Check it out!  Damn it!

Jews…

You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! 

I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 

Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 

Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?

Hiya, Dad!

Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?

Freeze, bitch!

I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!

No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!

No! A piece of celery.

I can't! Don't you understand?!

Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!

Hey! Whoooa.

Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called "chinballalitis."  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?

This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?

Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.

What?

Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?

Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.

Moooommmm?

Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.

No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.

For one tooth.

Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?

Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.

Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.

Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.

I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 

Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. 

No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?You guys are my best friendsThrough thick and thin, we've always been togetherWe're four of a kind, havin' fun all dayPallin' around and laughin' awayJust best friends, best friends are we.I love you guys. 

Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!

Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!

Avast there, mateys!  Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life?  Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time?  Then join Captain Cartman's Perfect Pirate Club, arrrr!  Just imagine it, me hearties! A life without rules, without homework and chores! You can live the pirate's life in Somalia, me friends!  Even Kyle said so.  Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house!

Really? I wanna be a cop.

Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.

Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 

What?

Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.

Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!

Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-

What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!

Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!

Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.

Boinsure li bonsure.

Oh crap! There's more of them! 

Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!

Wow, she's pretty.

Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!

How about geebo, or, or mung?

Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.

Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.

Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 

Or if I did?

Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.

No, I just don't care. At all.

Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.

How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.

What the hell are you doing?

Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.

In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.

Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?

What?!

You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.

Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.

Yes. And I've learned something, too.  Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.

Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.

Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.

Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!

That's right! You stay out!

Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?

No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! 

I swear, Kyle. 

Look, I have to have one of those phones!

Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.

He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!

You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 

Nothing! 

How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.

Ey!

Noo!! Nooo!!

Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.

Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.

No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!

Well, come on! I don't have much time! 

Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 

God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!

Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? 

Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! 

Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.

I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!

What?

You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.

Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.

Cool.

Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool. 

A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!

Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. 

Oh, no!

Right, except for you.

Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!

Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.

Yes or no, Kyle?!

Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.

Kyle! Fire spell!

Nononono, you gotta go  "But Mo-o-o-om."

Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 

You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!

It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.

Dude, that mom is kewl. 

Nono, Jeh-

Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. 

Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?

Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. 

I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 

Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.

Yeah, History Channel rules.

Ey, I'll get it!

Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!

Dude, what the hell is he doing?

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.

I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?

It's all Chinpokomon now.

"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure."  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 

Look, a covetous Jew!

Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. 

Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!

O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 

What? Let me see that. 

Sweet..!

Mom, I want a Twinkie.

What are you guys doing?

What?

Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! 

Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 

That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.

I'm going this way!

Up your ass with broken glass!

If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!

Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.

Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?

Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.

Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!

Dude, this is hella cool.

You sons of bitches! 

Der yourself, hippie!

Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!

Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!

...play stupid games.

All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.

Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. 

All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!

Butters, you wanna play me next? 

Oooo, trippy...

Five bucks.

I know my rights! Stop right now! 

I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.

Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! 

Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a "lahty do" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the "lahty" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second "yo ho". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? 

Bitch, I hate that bitch!

No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! 

Hey!

Who let the dogs out?

I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!

Just the good times.

Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.

More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.

Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 

Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!

A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!

I'm a bigger lesbian than you!

It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!

That's right, I did!You guys are hella stupidYou guys are hella lameYou guys are hella dumbHella hella hella!

Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.

Ahhhhhhhhh.  Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.

Dude, that's not cool.

So there is no war now in the future.

Um, could I get you to do something for me?

Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.

This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our "student athletes" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 

Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! 

Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 

We're screwed.

Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!

Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.

Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 

Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?

What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.

What? Tell us?

Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!

Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?

Yes ma'am.

Bad! Bad monkey! 

It's sooo sweet!

No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?

I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!

Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.

Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.

Whoa...

That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!

You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.

Gimme that cake!

Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?

Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!

This is awesome!

Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000" 

Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!

Eeehhh.

Where is Chef?

A- AIDS?

Get the rest of the stuff you guys!

Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!

Here. 

Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!

Well, right, or we could always do that.

Nice.

Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!

Hooray!

Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!

Alriiight!

Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!

Wwhat's that?

Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 

I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.

Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?

It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.

Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.

Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!

Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! 

All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. 

This guy sucks ass!

Don't, mother! Just, don't.

My consciences just caught up with me.

It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.

Weak.

You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?

How?

You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!

No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.

But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.

Mom! Mom, they did it!

Yeah,  get out of here! 

Eh! 

You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!

Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?

That'll do pig.

Oh no! The tape jammed! 

What does that mean?

We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!

I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 

I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 

Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...

Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 

Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.

Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. 

You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?

Egh... 

Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 

This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 

What?!

You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 

I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 

The answer to #28 is 14.

Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?

It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?

So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.

A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!

Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!

Yeah? 

What's he doin' here? 

SHUT UP, KITTY!

I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.

So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 

And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! 

...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?

But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?

Ey! 

Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?

Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 

You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 

So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 

Dude, do we look like police?

Goddamnit, get me down from here! 

I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! 

Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?

It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!

What do you mean?

What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.

And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.

Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?

Aay!  Let's hurry. This costume is hot.

Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. 

--you're my fantasy, you fanta--

Oh my God, and you can hear me??

...Goddamnit! 

Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!

How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.

He is black.

Shut up already!

Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!

I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.

Hang on a second here. 

Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!

No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!

Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?

Uh oh.

Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!

Hm. That was... weird.

Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!

Come on, come on!

It puts the lotion back in the basket!

You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!

Mom! Mom!

Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!

Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll roshambo you for it! 

Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!

Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.

You guys, shit...

Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. 

I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!

Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!

Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!

Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. 

What?!

What new Elmo doll?

No way dude. No way.

Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.

Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term "fag," Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?

You guys are just hella jealous.

Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!

That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.

How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!

Alright, I think we go over there. 

I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behnd my back!

Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!

Cool, these will be good uploads.

Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.

Uh, excuse us for a second... 

I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.

Go on, Kyle.

So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. 

Agreed.

I have balls.

Food!

That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 

Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!

Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?

Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip! 

Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.

Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.

Next?

Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.

Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?

It wasn't me! 

Come on. 

Why don't we just talk about the swastika?

Goddamnit, you just can't-

I was um, sure that the appointment was today.

Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.

Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay?

No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.

Oho kick fucking ass, dude! 

I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?

I know!

Okay, Mom.

Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. 

Ih... in our... butt?

Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 

God, I have to everything around here!

Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.

Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 

God damn it, shut up!

Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. 

How's it going, everybody?

That asshole is not getting across my border! 

Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.

What?!

We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.

Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.

"To Douglas." There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.

Hooray!

You can't hurt me.

Fat camp?

No. There is something I can do.

The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 

Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 

Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.

Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.

God damnit!  Shut up, Kitty!  Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha!  I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! 

I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.

Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!

Here, Butters!

Wow.

No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.

No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!  Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!

Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.

Oh. My. Goodddd.

Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.

My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!

We're a non-profit company, Kyle.

Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." 

Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.

We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.

I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!

Aw yeah!

Dude, don't call me a Canadian! 

Heellp! 

Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!

Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?

Thank you so very much.

I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?

So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!

That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.

What?

Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!

...Kenny?  Kenny?!

Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!

Yeah, that's me.

Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!

WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!

Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.

Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! 

The answer to #27 is 5.

Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! 

I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.

Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.

Yes!

And shopping malls! Hooray! 

Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit 

Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.

Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!

You're goin' with Christ! 

Okay, mom.

Who the hell are you?!

All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.

Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.

Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.

And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!

So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!

And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!

Jews can't be firemen.

Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 

What?! That's ridiculous!

This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.

Got ya! 

It's all that matters!

Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?

Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?

Guys?!

Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…

Es ist Zeit fër Rache!

You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.

Hm.

Hey, Chef.

What the hell are they doing?

Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!

Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.

'"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink."' 

Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!

Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.

...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. 

Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.

Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.

Amen.

...Tits.

Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...

Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 

Yeah? 

It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys! 

Break my Xbox and you'll never know.

Yikes!  Ow!  Son of a bitch!

Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 

I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.

Fine! 

What is that butthole doing now?!

Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 

This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!

Ugh.

Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!

Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, "We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, "Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!" 

Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!

So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?

I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?

I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.

Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. 

Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.

We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.

Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.

Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.

I'm not saying it.

Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.

Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 

No way dude.

Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix! 

It's okay, man, come on.

I wonder who took it.

Me, too!

Okay, why?

You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!

Ah, crap! 

Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!

Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!

Noooo! 

Ahh!

God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?

Hey!

All right, Bebe, let's see the list.

Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.

Will you all shut up so I can do this!?

Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an "A-"?

My God...

Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!

What is it, Chef?

We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.

That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.

Hey, dudes.

I wasn't making fun of anybody.

You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 

He's right in here.

Mom, seriously! 

Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! 

Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.

Ehh, eh, ehhhh! 

I'm dying of boredom.

Jeez, that girl is pissed off.

That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?

Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 

The?!

Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 

So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.

And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.

Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?

My mom made it, isn't it cool?

My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.

No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!

Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 

Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!

But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!

God, I hate you so much, Stan!

Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.

When are we gonna learn magic tricks?

No.

Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.

Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.

Heh- hello?

Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.

Fluffy!

You wanna take it out for a spin?

Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!

You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!

Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!

Oh no! You guys broke up?

I can be forgiven?

If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-

Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! 

Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!

All right, get down. This is my kind of bullride.

Told ya!

Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.

(Hey! Come over here!)

Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!

Hall infraction! 

Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!

Bang bang bang... 

Oh God!

Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!

Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?

This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.

Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.

My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.

Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!

But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?

I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!

Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!

NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.

Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?

You're not ugly.

Red Power! 

Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?

You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!

Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. 

Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. 

Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.

Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 

Planetariums suck!

What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?

This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.

Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.

Tell me about it.

Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?

Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.

He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??

But... it's me.

Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say "herro" and "prease" a lot.  "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.

Come on, Craig!

Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...

Me neither.

You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.

Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 

Jesus Christ!

You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 

Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! 

Come on, you guys!

Yeah, go home you little dildo.

I told you guys!

JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 

Four thousand dollars? 

Yes, it's working! 

So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.

Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. 

They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! 

Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.

I am here... to teach you calculuuus.

Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.

I'm pissed!

Stem cells, numbnuts!

But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 

God-dammit! 

Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!

Maaaa. M-maaaa.

Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.

All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.

Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!

No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.

What?

Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!

Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! 

Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?

This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.

When do we get the sports watch?

It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.

You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see

All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.

Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 

You guys are all such pussies!

We can't understand you, asshole! 

That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!  What?

The Jews!

Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!

Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-

DO IT!  Come on buddy.

Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.

Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.

I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!

How long is that Chessy Poofs van gonna be outside?

It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.

I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.

When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.

I'm trying.

Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.

Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?

Oh, I think I see where this is going. 

I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.

Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.

So what?! That makes you from Jersey!

No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.

Kyle, Jesus Christ!

Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! 

That's it?

What news?

See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! 

No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!

You shut up,  ass-logger!

Screw you, hippie!

Kyle?

Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?

Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.

We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?

I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.

Oh, boy!  Superbitch is at it again!

Get their hands on what?  Dude... 

Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... 

But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.

You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!

That's more like it.

You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?

God, I hate you, Kenny.  I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! 

Wow, cool!

Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.

Yes! She fucks me so hard!

You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!

Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!

I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!

Protruding vaginal boner.

Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 

Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.

Sorry about this.

Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. 

Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?

Hey...

Somebody's baking brownies. 

Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!

Stan, you guys are good! 

Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?

They've got what backward? 

Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.

Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!

Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! 

Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!

Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.

Ugh.

No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.

Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.

Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!

What?

Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 

Lame!

Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.

I don't. I made it up. 

You say Kenny, but I say tomato! 

Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!

Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...

His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."

Butters, what's the problem?

Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.

Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?

Not cool! Totally lame! 

Dude! That was so badass!

Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.

All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 

Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!

No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!

Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!

Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman."  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!

Well, I guess you're screwed, then. 

Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!  Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! 

Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!

I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?

Hoosajiggawha?

What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.

Check.

No it isn't, you guys!

What, what is it? What is it for?

That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!

All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 

Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 

Why the hell not?!

Gross, Kyle!

That's right.

Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.

Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?

Well, there's a whole crappy band here!  Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? 

Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! 

Dude...
