Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!

Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on. 

Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.

See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being such a great role model for me.  Piece of crap.

That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?

Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!

Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?

Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin! 

Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!

Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.

... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 

That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?

I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.

Huh? First graders?  Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!

Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!

I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!

Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.

Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.

Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.

Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.

Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. 

Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!

My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.

Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.

You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.

Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.

No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!

Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?

No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!

Don't stress about it or you just might faint.

Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!

Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!

Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! 

Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!

I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.

What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!

I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?

Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.

Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!

Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.

We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.

You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?

When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.

Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.

Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!

I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-

Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.

How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?

Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!

That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.

"Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.

It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 

We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!

No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. 

Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.

Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?

How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.

Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?

Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?

GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 

I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.

Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.

But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.

You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!

Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. 

And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 

Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!

When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-

Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?

No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?

Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.

Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!! 

Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.

Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.

Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called "chinballalitis."  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?

Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!

Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.

You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.

Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.

All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. 

Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!

Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!

Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 

And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?

Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.

Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. 

Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.

Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.

Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.

No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!

My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.

Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.

Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!

Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.

You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!

Yes. I will be your new best friend.

Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!

Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. 

You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see

Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!

Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!

You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 

Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.

Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.

I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 

It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.

Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.

How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 

Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!

We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! 

Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.

My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o

It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.

No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?! 

Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?

Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! 

Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! 

I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.

Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-

Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.

Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! 

Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 

Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.

They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.

No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.

And I am the official messenger boy, I am.

Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.

If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"

Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.

The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! 

Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 

I don't know, but you're the only one who can.

Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!

Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.

Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?

He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.

Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.

In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.

Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is. It's inside my shoe. 

Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...

Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!

No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.

The rest of you will just have to try another day.

Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?

Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.

I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!

Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 

All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?

Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!

Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff. 

The word is out.  "Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts." I tweeted it.  It's trending.

There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.

I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.

So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 

It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.

All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.

Turn around so I can clean out your ass.

Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.

Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!

Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!

Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.

You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.

Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?

Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!

Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! 

Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!

Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o. 

I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.

Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. 

Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!

Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!

You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.

Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 

Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!

No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!

All right, hit one out of the park!

Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.

All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.

I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.

Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!

Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.

Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?

Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?

Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.

We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what "lost" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!

Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.

We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!

I only know how to do it doggie style.

Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!

Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.

Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.

Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.

Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!

Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.

Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 

Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?

What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!

This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!

Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.

Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.

I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.

God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!

It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 

Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.

I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!

Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?

Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.

OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!

Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?

Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!

Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!

She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...

Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!

For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!

My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.

I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.

I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?

Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.

I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--

Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.  One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!

Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!

Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!

Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...

Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!

Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 

So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.

Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.

Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 

Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!

Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.

Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.

The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!

Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.

Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.

I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.

Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.

Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?

Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.

If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*  

Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.

Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.

You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!

Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?

So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?

Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!

Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.

No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.

'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!

You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. 

Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?

I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.

That is really starting to piss me off.

What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!

Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!

Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?

Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!

It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.

I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.

Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.

Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!

Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.

So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!

Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!

How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? 

Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.

Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. 

Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.

Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.

Happy holidays, everyone!  Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.

Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!

The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.

So... so then, how can you feel bad?

I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.

It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?

God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!

I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...

But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.

You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?

Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?

This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!

Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.

Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!

All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?

Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!

Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?

Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!

Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman."  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!

Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.

'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.

The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!

Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!

I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!

I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.

And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?

Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!

Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!

It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.

No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!

I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!

That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!

Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.

You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.

Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.

Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!

You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.

Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 

Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! 

Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 

I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 

Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!

Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.

I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!

You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.

Full cheeks!  Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! 

He's a little wuss, what's it look like? 

Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!

Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!

I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!

Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time." When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.

Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 

Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.

Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.

Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!

No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!

So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!

Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 

Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 

Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.

Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!

It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.

Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.

My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.

You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.

Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.

I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!

Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.

THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!

Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.

I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!

Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!

Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.

Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 

Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 

Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!

So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?

Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!

But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!

Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.

Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.

Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!

Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.

No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!

I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-

The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?

Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.

Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.

That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.

Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!

Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.

It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?

Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!

Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?

Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.

We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 

That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!

No hey ut what, what I meant to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 

Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!

Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-

No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.

You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!

What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!

Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 

Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?

Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.

When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?

Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 

This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional champsionship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?  Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?  Apparently, only I do.

Ready. I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-laI hope my will enjoy my danceFiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ayWould you like some sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--

Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.

Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.

You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 

Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.

Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.

Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.

It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!

It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!

Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.

Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!

That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. 

Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.

See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. 

Never mind him.  He's a very disturbed little boy.

I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia.  Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! 

Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?

I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.

Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.

This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 

Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.

Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!

Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. 

What if you didn't have to give it up?

And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. 

Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip! 

Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.

Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.

All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!

Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.

We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.

Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!

Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!

You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.

It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!

You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.

We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 

This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?

Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.

Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!

The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 

He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!

Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. 

Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.

Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.

Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.

I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!

Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. 

Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face. 

...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.

Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!

Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.

Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.

Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-

Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?

Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!

Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!

All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.

Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.

Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 

No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!

Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. 

My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah? 

Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?

Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.

Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!

You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!

Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.

I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.

Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.

God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?

I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!

Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.

Ha! You just got f'd in the a!

But my mom says you're the guy she was with.

Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!

You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 

No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!

We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.

Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.

Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 

Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.

"Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."

You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!

Shut your goddamn mouth.  We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--

I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.

Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.

You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 

Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.

Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.

This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual".  This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.

I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.

Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!

On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...

Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.

Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!

Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!

Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."

The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 

Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!

This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.

Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!

Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!

Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?

It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.

Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.

I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.

So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!

Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?

Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! 

Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.

You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.

Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!

It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. 

No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!

O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?

...I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television...

Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?

Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.

Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 

Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. 

Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. 

All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 

You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!

That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.

I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!

Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...

Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 

Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. 

I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!!  SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! 

Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 

Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... 

Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 

Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!

Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.

Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?

Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!

Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.

Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!

Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!

Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.

All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?

...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!! 

Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.

God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 

THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?

Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.

It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!

Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?

I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here.

Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.

My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.

Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 

...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.

Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!

The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!

Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!

Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.

Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. 

Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…

Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.

It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!

I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.

That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!

Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! 

How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!

Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.

Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 

I'm gonna go take care of this prick!

Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!

What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.

God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?

You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!

It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 

No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?You guys are my best friendsThrough thick and thin, we've always been togetherWe're four of a kind, havin' fun all dayPallin' around and laughin' awayJust best friends, best friends are we.I love you guys. 

Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!

This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.

Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 

Sweet. I think we're next in line now.

Deah, eh eh.  Oh man, what a weird dream!

I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!

Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? 

That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.

You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 

Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 

Well, I don't see any crocs out here.

Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!
