Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. 
I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 
Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! 
Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! 
So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?
Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!
Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass," "butthole," and "douchebag." I really don't feel like you guys's friend. 
Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! 
I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
I ain't helpin' crap!  I want to eat some paeh.
A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 
You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: "Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches"!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! 
Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. 
Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??
We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. 
The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?
What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 
Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? 
That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home. 
Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. 
You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my "Stop Listening To Me" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours. 
Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh!  You get out now and respect my authoritah!  Ow! 
Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 
Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious
Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
City of Santa Monica
Lots of rich people
giving change to the homeless
Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. "Time to pay up, Kyle."  But then...  "NO! NOOO!"  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 
...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
Okay, that's enough fatass jokes for this week.
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 
Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.
Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. 
Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control! 
I love to singa
About the moona and June-a and the springa
I love to singa
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...
Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 
Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! 
Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...
Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! 
Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. 
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 
Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 
Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 
Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. 
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. 
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!
...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 
I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 
Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 
Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 
Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
We got him! I know where he is!
We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"
Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now.  Yep, there's Kyle, Stan andn Kenny looking stupid as ever.
God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 
I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, "I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!
Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!
Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. 
That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!
Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. 
Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. 
That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. 
Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.
Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! 
Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy
Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 
Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 
She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. 
Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!" 
Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 
Me, too.  I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- 
Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin.  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
No need. I have one for you right here. 
...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .
Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 
Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?" Right?
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.
Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. 
Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  "Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!" 
Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...
The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 
Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
Oh, no.  Damnit!  No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!  Uh. Yes. Uh...
All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail" 
You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!
What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. 
Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!
Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?
Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!
Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.
Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. 
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…
You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
Um, could I get you to do something for me?
Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 
Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!
I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behnd my back!
Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
Kevin, Jesus Christ!  Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah!  Clyde, the fuck?!
Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! 
Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 
Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. 
We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.
Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!  I'll see you later at my house.
And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
Huh?  Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..! 
Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. 
Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.
I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, "Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!" and I smack him on the head!
It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 
Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 
Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 
Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
That's fine, just get it out of the way...
Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my-  Aha! There's a king croc right there!  And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-
Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto
And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!
Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
I told you this game was sweet, dude.
Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 
Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? 
I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!
Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a "lahty do" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the "lahty" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second "yo ho". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? 
Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.
Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! 
Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 
Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
Ey, sweet!  Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.
We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what "lost" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!
The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 
We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
So how long until we can joke about it?
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 
That asshole is not getting across my border! 
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!
I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? 
For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! 
No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 
No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay. 
Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 
And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  "my parents molestered me."
And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? 
God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. 
He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 
Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.
God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. 
That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this "poutaine".
No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!
Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?
Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. 
Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!
I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. 
Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!  You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!! 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 
Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?
Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."
Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f- 
They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 
Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 
Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 
Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! 
If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. 
Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! 
For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!
Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl
Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 
Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part?
The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.
