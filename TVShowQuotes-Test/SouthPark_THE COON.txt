Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all.

I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move.

Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos.

Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!

I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity.
