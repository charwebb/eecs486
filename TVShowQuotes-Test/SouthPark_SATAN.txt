No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice.
Um, maybe just... a little one.  I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore.  I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now.  What is this?
Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it!
No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?
My life is good now, Saddam. Chris treats me well. You and I are through. Good-bye. 
Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.
I will crush him like a little bug!
I'm not alienating my friends! I know they come first!
Then God is helpless.  Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!
God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.
On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities!
