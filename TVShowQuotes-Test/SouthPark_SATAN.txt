Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it!
Chris!  Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!
Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes.
I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer.
Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopa-mine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life.
Thanks. See ya, Gary. Thanks for comin'. Oh- Hi, Marsha.
On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities!
No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now.
Oh God, what's happened to me? I've never been this terrible before. By trying to have a party like those spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV, I've become like one of them.
Saddam, I only came here because I need closure.
No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation!  I just don't know what I'm gonna say.
