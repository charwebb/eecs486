God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.
Very well.  Demon Army, begin your march on Heaven! 
No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy.
Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits!
Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy, they won't have cars.
Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want.  So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself. 
You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too so people have free will and all that shit. But you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay.
Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?
Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!
I know, but just wait till midnight. You are not gonna believe what's coming for desert! 
And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all.
