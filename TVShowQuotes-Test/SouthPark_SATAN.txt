Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.

Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.

This party has to be the bomb! Don't you get it?!  When everyone sees the Ferrari cake,  they will shudder and know my greatness!

Saddam...

Waw. Uhuh. I'm sorry, I mean, Chris. 

Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.

I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer.

No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation!  I just don't know what I'm gonna say. 

IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM, IT'S ALL ABOUT MEEEEEEE!!! 

Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!

Oh, dear God. 

And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all.

Did Diddy do it?

Hey, Hitler.  What's the matter, little guy?

Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Matthau, but I can't. Chris and I just moved to the west side and we have to unpack.

Then God is helpless.  Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!

Yeah.

Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes. 

Chris, just... don't... don't do that.

Awgh... Not again.
