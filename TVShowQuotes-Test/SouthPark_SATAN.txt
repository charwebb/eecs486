Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!
Nobody can look hotter than me! It's my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party! Take it off, Zazul.  And what about my Ferrari cake?! Where's the Ferrari cake?!
There goes Jeffrey Dahmer with a festive Christmas ham.
After he has sex with it, he'll eat up all he can.
And there goes John F. Kennedy, caroling with his son.

Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus. 
Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain!
Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, "temptation has to be nuanced!" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?
And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all.
I don't want to talk to you, Saddam! This isn't what I need in my life right now.
Even Mao Tse Tung is under the spell 
Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore!
Shut up, it's Halloween! This is my night! Then at midnight, for dessert, I'm thinking over here, we bring out a huuuge chocolate fondue fountain.
