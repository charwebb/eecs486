Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?  You young man! How would you like to be a cowboy? Or a- swashbuckling pirate?  And you! How would you like to be an astronaut, faaar out in space? All it takes is a little...  imagination.
Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!  Come with me, little boy! I'm going to get you home!
