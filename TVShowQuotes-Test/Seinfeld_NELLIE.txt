I'm trying to adopt a baby.
Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I���m this patrician goddess. But here���s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ��� what���s lower than dirt?
Blow in my ear.
Yeah. I...
So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
May I say one thing?
Pam, what is your address? I���m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don���t ���
Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You���re welcome, Andy. And you���re welcome, my own ass.
Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I���m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can���t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
Hmm. Yeah. ��All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...
Well done, you two.
Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?
[sighs]
Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.
Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
The first 'sorry' sounded sincere.
Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
Can I see the wound?
That's not even a thing.
Oh thank you so much!
I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
No no no no.
Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Dwight, what about you?
Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just��� you three, no.
The real Mose.
I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
You are most welcome.
Very good point.
So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
[walks in] Oh.
By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
Well then if I could just convince...
Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!
How are things in the warehouse?
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Do you think I���d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We���ll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won���t we?
Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
Is It?
Yes!
You're the stupid one.
Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
Oh.
The way he just cuts off his arm.
