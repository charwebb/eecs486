No question.
We do not wanna hear about this.
Cancel wallpaper.
In the box.
[murmurs] Thought it was worth a try.
Hmm?
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
It's all about my bonus.
You ran over an employee.
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
Shuckin��� your peas.
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
He can top that.'
The flirtatious tickling.
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
[on phone] There are a hundred packs..
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
Mmhmm. What?
No I'm not.
I don't care.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
Not your staff, Michael. You.
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
Mmhmmm.
It's collard greens.
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.
Not maybe. Yes or no.
Hi, Michael.
Oh, actually no I don't Michael.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
Aw, let him do it.
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
That���s Benji. Oh, he���s precious. That���s a healthy-looking baby.
Fair enough.
Goodbye. [walks away]
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
That's ok.
We all saw you do it.
Money.
New File System'.
Night, everybody.
Ohhh���
Next stop pies! [group joins in]
Try mose1234.
Helllloooo!
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
Is that supposed to be me?
What.
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
I'm in. [sits back down]
There was a car.
They are not.
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
Who let this boy on the phone?
We sit close.
Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
Look for your stapler!
Way to go, Ryan!
Fruity and delicious.
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
