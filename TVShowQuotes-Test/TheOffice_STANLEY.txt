That's right. [laughs]
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
I usually take a siesta about now.
Keep talking all you want.
Heh, heh, heh.
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
Is that it?
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
No question.
Get us out of this!
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
I'm going to die.
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?
[flashback] Not maybe. Yes or no.
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
Hey!
You brought balloons to a play?
He ain���t coming.
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.
Oh, my ankle!
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
You find anything?
A little bit more and I would have had it.
Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
Oh, thanks.
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
Where did you get these facts?
That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They're always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too?  Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
What the hell is going on here?
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
[in pain] Oh. Go away.
Oh, for the love of God.
Okay. It's called Who Would You Do?
[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
Fair enough.
Eh...
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Money.
Please. A little further.
What?
Not a gun.
Mailboxes, Etc.
Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy]
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
You two better watch yourselves.
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
Trust me. It only gets worse.
How is that going to work?
In the African-American community-
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
Oh, sure, we talk all the time.
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
Great.
It's a bad bet.
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
Co-manager of what?
I love Philly. Dirty town.
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
How did you get in my car?
