So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
A little bit more and I would have had it.
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...

how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
