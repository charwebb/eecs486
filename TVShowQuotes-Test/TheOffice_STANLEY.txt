I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ���em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
It could be out of your hands Michael.
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can���t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
Do you want us to look for 'em?
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.
