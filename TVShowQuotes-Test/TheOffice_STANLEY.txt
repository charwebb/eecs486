I will not work in a roach billboard.
Or do you only drink with your kids?
We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
[through the fence to Terri, who's holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don't know.  They didn't give him his Christmas bonus this year, so...
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
No, you didn���t. Sick of you and your���ooh���
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.
