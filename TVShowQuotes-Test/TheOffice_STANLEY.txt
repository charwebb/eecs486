Night, everybody.
Is it nice outside?
[angry] Yeah wow!
And we are grateful.
Why is it so hot in here?
You really like her, huh?
Don���t be pushy Jim. It���s tacky.
Get us out of this!
What's that supposed to mean?
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
So?
Oh, actually no I don't Michael.
[flashback] Not maybe. Yes or no.
You said we were getting bonuses.
My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
Ooh, bring it over.
What?
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.
[On the phone] You���ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
I don't know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
Oh, great.
There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
That���s Benji. Oh, he���s precious. That���s a healthy-looking baby.
About what?
Fine.
Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
I agree.
Mm, how many bedrooms?
Thank you. [reaches for bagel]
Are you out of your damn mind?
I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
Helllloooo!
Money.
And me.
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
Look for your stapler!
...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
What are you doing?
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
You said, we could bring our families.
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby.
Thank you, Michael.
Michael, are you that blind?
If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.
Good day.
Leave me alone, dammit.
Perfect, isn't it?
[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
Great.
Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
You want us to apologize to you?
[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
[chuckling] What a messed up world.
Oh, is today Recyclops Day?
That's not what a hate crime is.
Eh...
Next stop pies! [group joins in]
Yes, please let us know.
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
Oh, sweet mother of God.
