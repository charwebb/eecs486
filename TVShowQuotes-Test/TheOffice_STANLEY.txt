We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.
Son, you���ve lost your mind. I���m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
How on earth are we supposed to sell���?
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
I am not going to apologize to you.
Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account.
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders'
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
Oh, no, I���m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
No, you didn���t. Sick of you and your���ooh���
Hey, it���s five o���clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they���re making me climb Stair Mountain!
Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
