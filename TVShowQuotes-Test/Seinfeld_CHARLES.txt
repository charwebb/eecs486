What's that?
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
What is wrong with you?
What?
Let's see what you got in those legs!
Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
Hey Hank, You ready?
Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
Good. As I was saying...
Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
Hank?  No, I don't need Hank Michael.
You two are morons.
Come in...
Okay, let me know if you find it.
Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Yes we are!
You still have that option. [Michael sighs]
No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
What?  How'd you hear that?
