Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along.

Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. Important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and I.

Tweek, calm down. Have some coffee. 

Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met.  You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive.

Oh yeah?! 

Who else could it have been?
