Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez.
Thank you Miss Yothers.  Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume.  And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! 
Okay children, let's all take our seats.  Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? 
That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment!  Take it Mr. Slave! 
Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?
And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus.
Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father!
...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda. 
I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know.
Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig.
Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. 
Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so.
Chapter 18.
Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about.
Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!
And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused.  "Go on", Rebecca said softly, "Touch me." Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises.
They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with...
Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?!  Oh, Mr. Hat!
No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!
I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!
Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together?  Let's see, how about...
Children, I have a very important announcement to make.  I'm quitting my job as a teacher. 
Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions?  Yes, Stan?
Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head 
Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?
Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?
Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.
Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?  Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!  The prank is over!  You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch.  God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?! 
Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?
Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch.
Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!
Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.
Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is  Mr. Garrison.
Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?
Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?
...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such.  Put the four together and we're ready to go. 
I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.
There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce.  Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.
Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Oowww! 
Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!
Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.
Mr. Mackey, can he just go talk to the principal?
This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!
Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure.
Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.
Ogod, you're not gonna lay that Channukah crap on me, are you?
Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack.
And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Uh, boys!  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?
Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it!   Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year.
And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.
Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?
Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis.  He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste.
What the...?  Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.  Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself! 
I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman. 
It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks.
O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history.  Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972?  Yes?
No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me. 
No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have.
Good.  Very good.  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.
No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!
Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence?  Hmm, what are the odds of that?
Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! 
That's right children. Are there any questions?  Yes, Stanley?
It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished.
You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!
And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.
Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left.  I'm not going to take you back.  You can just go to hell!  You go to hell and you die!  You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!  I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!  What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
