Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.

Now, pay attention. Ahem...
I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East 
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.
And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, 
Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday 
So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. 
There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. 
They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. 
They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.
And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,
Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. 
So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. 
Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,
Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. 
So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. 
On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
"Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you." 
Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat.

Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!

I can do this. I have to do this.  Hello. Dad.

Ow! Jesus, lady!

But you work for the-  uh, God-damnit!!

Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?

Yeah.  Hey, rich guy!  Hey, Richie Rich! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook? 

I hope you give them the chair!  Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. 

I thought you just came from the bathroom.

Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?

Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 

Oh. 

You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow.

Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep. 

What the hell is going on??

Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile.

Eric, for the love of Jesus...

Come on you little bitch. 

It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--

You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!

Hold Butters' hand, Eric! 

Jesse Jackson?

SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! 

Oh wait wait wait. Was it the pagan remark?

Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.

Well okay.

Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's see. 

Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.

But this is insane!

That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.

How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase "t"!

All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. 

Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Oowww! 

I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad!  Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...

All right boys, show us what you've brought. 

All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. 

Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it!  I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!

Okay, children, let's take our seats.  We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. 

Okay children, let's all take our seats.  As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.

It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete that?

See, I told ya. 

Get along, little Slave.

Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!

Thank you for that presentation Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a "D-".

That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!

Heyhey, where is little Stanley?

A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.

Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.  And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?  Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.  Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.

Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!

Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season.

Yeahyeahyeah. So, did you read the book?

There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.

Mr. Hat isn't real.

Huh where are you goin'?

Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?

To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!  Oh my God, what have I said?

Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better."

Eric I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.

Shutting me down? Why?

Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!!  Go ahead.

Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!! 

Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit.

Alright, let's try it again.

I will  NOT put up with  TOM foolery in my  CLASS room, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth.  Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure. 

Jesus! Why are they doing this?

Well, just make something up, like Eric did.

Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.

Oh, for real? You're not kidding?

And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Uh, boys!  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?

Okay, good. Just step through here  And then this is your steering and here's your throttle.

And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon , and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? But where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- 

Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.

Ding-ding, ding-ding.

Okay, Mr. Slave! 

Well, you don't see that everyday.

You all receive an F... minus.

Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat.

Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.

Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.

He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!

Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?

What? Jail?

Come on you little bitch.  You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy.

And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol. 

And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, "The Miracle Worker." 

You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!

Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring.

Well, you know...

That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...

Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.

O-ogh! 

I'm going whether you like it or not!

You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help.  And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. 

All right children, let's take our seats.

Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever!

Aggghhh! 

Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!  Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house! 

Sure.

You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
