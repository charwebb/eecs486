And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?  Yes, Kyle?
I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you. 
Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.
We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. 
Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.
You can't close your eyes forever, Mother!  Mother, wait! 
Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have.
Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mis-Mr. Twig?  Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!
Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago. And I was only a child.
He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!
Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!
Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ole Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!
Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon. 
Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.
Thank you Miss Yothers.  Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume.  And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! 
Chapter 18.
Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about.
Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!
And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused.  "Go on", Rebecca said softly, "Touch me." Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises.
They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with...
Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?!  Oh, Mr. Hat!
Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about.
Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem!  Another Cosmo, please.
Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits.
...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.  Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh... 
Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats.  Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel- 
You're the ones who made it this way!
Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!
That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! 
Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?
That's it. Gyration.  A gyroscope.  It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius!  It's so simple and yet genius!
Okay, children, does eveyone have their leotards on? 
Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president.
Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-
You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.
Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?
Okay children, let's all take our seats.  Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? 
But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
But the good news is,  I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher. 
Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better."
Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?
So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know. 
Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.
I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering.  The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. 
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season.
Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'.  Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project.
I'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard.  Really long and really hard. 
Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it!  I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!
"Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"
Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything!
Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?
I have to know why! Right here and nowâ€”we're gonna talk about this!
Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel.
I just act that way to get chicks, dumb ass. 
That's right children. Are there any questions?  Yes, Stanley?
That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman.
Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?
They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
Okay, children, let's settle down!  Huhh I mean it; I want quiet!  My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin.  Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?!  Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex.  Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!
Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!
Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.
Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass.  No! Mr. Hat, you get back here!
