You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!
Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could.  You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.
So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know. 
You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?
No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!
Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--
There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?
Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.
Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?
Okay, children, let's take our seats.  My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little  "nervous breakdown" and went into the mountains where I lived off of "rat carcasses".  But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten.  But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?
They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?
Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
Okay okay, go ahead.  As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. 
Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago. And I was only a child.
No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me. 
And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.
Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mis-Mr. Twig?  Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!
Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!
No! No, Filmore! You can say "I have to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have to poop," but not "I have to shit." Are we all clear?
You can't close your eyes forever, Mother!  Mother, wait! 
Thank you Miss Yothers.  Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume.  And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! 
Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!
I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?
Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs!
But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?
And the winner of the costume contest is  Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! Come on up, Wendy. 
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!
Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.
HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! 
Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—
Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?  Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!  The prank is over!  You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch.  God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?! 
Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today.  Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?
Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?
Hokay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? 
Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.
Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure.
Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Oowww! 
Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!
No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!
And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains.
—You need to work on your study skills!
Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! 
Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.
There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say "get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"
Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.
Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts
Oh yeah, now this is getting good 
Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard.
His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his
penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples
Uh, let's see...  Diana's nipples...  Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck.  Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat.
Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes.  Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers. 
Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! 
Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?
Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me.
You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? I don't know, it's a little small.
Say 'hi' to Damien!  And where are you from, Damien?
Whereas salagadoola mechicka boola = x and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo is y, put 'em together and whattaya got? Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. x + y = y, x = 0. The song is badly written. Second verse: x + y = bibbidi-bobbidi cubed + boo-
