Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!
Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat.
You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? I don't know, it's a little small.
Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate...  uh-uh, what's your name again?
I thought you just came from the bathroom.
Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave.  Now we'll get fired for sure!
He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!
It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqu√© parts... 
...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.  Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh... 
We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me.  I'll take it!
Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you.  Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.
You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a- 
Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month?  One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.
...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such.  Put the four together and we're ready to go. 
Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?
Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! 
Was he on the school bus this morning?
We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!
A note from the principal? "Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder."  Oh, brother!
These pictures just arrived.  I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed.  Now, go arrest him!  What..?
No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!
Good.  Very good.  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.
But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to...  Mr. Slave. 
Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. 
Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. 
Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!
Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!
Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us!
Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!
And so, children, instead of saying "Hand in your papers," I may now say, "Hand in your shit." Any questions?
Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie.
Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? 
Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.
Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.
Children, do you know how to file a police report?
We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. 
So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's assistant.  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.
Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.
Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack.
Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials. 
No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on! 
Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase "t"! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!
See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan.
Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!
Olay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
Everyone, let's give K. C. and his weed a big hand.  Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.
Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun. 
No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me. 
Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!
Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
Well, just make something up, like Eric did.
Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.
Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it.  The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love.
Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit.
They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. 
Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mis-Mr. Twig?  Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!
Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!
