Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff.

And never let poontang come between you and your friend.

Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.

Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that?  You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head.  What kind of sick weirdo are you?

...And Mr. Twig is at home; he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history.

And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.

I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing Jimbo.

He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.

Thank you for that presentation Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a "D-".

Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.

And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, "The Miracle Worker." 

...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?  Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.  Okay.  Now let's practice our... 

Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate...  uh-uh, what's your name again?

I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat.

Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live thereâ€”my  ...father still lives there.

You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!

Okay okay, go ahead.  As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. 

Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?

You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.

Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.

Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?

He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!

I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, "The ball is red..." 

How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans? 

Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. 

Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!

Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!

I told you never say his name in my presence.

Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?

Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!

Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!!  Go ahead.

You talkin' to me?  Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.

Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...

Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?

Who should we call on next Mr. Hat?

Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!

Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.  Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?

And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.

Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better."

Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!

You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!

We don't have any African-Americans in our class!

You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? I don't know, it's a little small.

It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible  is IT's patented gyroscope design.  Gentlemen, I give you, IT!

She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.

Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever!

No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did.

Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.

Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?

"Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"

Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!

That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?

So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know. 

Oh, wuh, welluh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.

Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford.

I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.

All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.  Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.  This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.

Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!

But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.

"What's Vietnam?" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war.

Who-? Who are you? What do you want?

There has to be a way to find out what's going on.

Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!

I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
