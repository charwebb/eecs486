I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.
Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes.
Leave us. We must finish what we have begun. 
Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!  Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman? 
Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!
Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!
Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag! You wanna make out or something?
Okay, children, does eveyone have their leotards on? 
And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. 
Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'.  Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project.
That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! 
Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!  Okay. I'm going to turn around now.  Shit!
Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.  A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?
Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-
No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!
Is there a problem Kenny?  Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?
...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!
Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. 
Look, there's more of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main.
I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know.
Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.
Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.
Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?
All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.  Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.  This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.
Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too.  Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?
I'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard.  Really long and really hard. 
Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doodoo at Eric?
...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such.  Put the four together and we're ready to go. 
Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. 
Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problems.
Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? 
I thought of it before you were born!
I hope you give them the chair!  Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. 
I'll just... be going up to bed now.  Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have.  Are there problems at home?
I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns! 
I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
It can't be. These can't be right.  Mr. Hat!
Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?
Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here!
I have to know why! Right here and nowâ€”we're gonna talk about this!
And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a "Mongol," not to be confused with a "mongoloid" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what  ...year ...the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  That's odd.  Those ROTC guys are way off course. 
And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children.  Yeah.
Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!
Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?
Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.
Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. 
Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!
Okay, kids, get ready to take your places.
Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could.  You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.
I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
...And Mr. Twig is at home; he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history.
Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!
But the good news is,  I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher. 
Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-
Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.
Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!
Olay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
