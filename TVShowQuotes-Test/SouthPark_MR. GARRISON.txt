UUUUUuuuuuugh

Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa! Who? Who are you?

Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!

What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?

A note from the principal? "Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder."  Oh, brother!

Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!

I told you never say his name in my presence.

We're out.  We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.

Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.

Guinea rats?

Aww, yeah.

Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws. 

Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?!  That's what I thought! Now pay attention!  Okay, children, now, the biggest fatass was an old skank by the name of-

No no, I was the asshole. 

That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!

We'll probably be dead by sunrise!

Jesus! Why are they doing this?

And so, children, instead of saying "Hand in your papers," I may now say, "Hand in your shit." Any questions?

Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass.  No! Mr. Hat, you get back here! 

Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.

I, I do not know you, sir.

Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight!  E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too?

Oh yeah?!  I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final!  Let's just see you try and go without me!  Mi-Mr. Hat?

Here he comes! 

Oh my God.

Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.

Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.

Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!

That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...

Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!

Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.

To the planetarium.

Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.

What? Jail?

You... yuh, you what?

Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.

Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 

All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. 

Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head 

Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!  How can gay men do this to their own people??  Unless... you're not gay at all... 

What?

Poontang's poontang.

Oh, whatever!

She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien. 

Oh. 

Yiou know, those types! Rich people! 

Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama. 

O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?

That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm.

Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey. 

What?? That's what I'm doing!

Well, that's four fingers; try five.

And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children.  Yeah.

Uh, Craig, how about you?

Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. 

Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.

Who should we call on next Mr. Hat?

This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!

Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.

Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?

Well, hell, turn it up.

HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! 

Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?

Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. 

I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad!  Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...

Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?

We can save the town and be super-rich!

Sure, kids. 

T is for "time to leave," cashchucker!

Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  "Tolerate" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!

Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-

What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-

One of you?!  We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!

Your sister?!  Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss.  Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!

Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it!  I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!

Eric, shut up! 

Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep. 

Dugh!  Ogh. Waaaaah! 

Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant.

Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next.

What, what do you mean?

Well, I... guess you could. 

Stop them! They're crab people!

Children, do you know how to file a police report?

Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us.

Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.

And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.

Well of course Stanley, what is it?

Ough, ergh. Eww. 

That was close, Mr. Hat.

Eric, partner with Butters.

Kyle, what are you doing here?

Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?

Well crap, that didn't work.

...So?

Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doodoo at Eric?

Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut.

That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought. "Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? 

Is this still part of the show?

Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??
