That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.
Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!
Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...
We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed
Why the hell not? We're at war.  Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat.
This is about history, kids.  If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  "politically correct." Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL!  And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?
I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.
Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!
Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!
Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.
'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.
There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Oh, wait, that's not him. 
Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.
It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. 
Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express.
Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!
Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.  The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.  We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device  while Ned will ambush him from the rear.  Now, Ned! He's not looking!  Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!  Ned. Ne-ed?  Oh, no!  Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!  Come back to me, buddy.
Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?
All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!
No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.
We have to give in to their demands.
Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that- 
Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear …one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful… By God, it's coming right for us! 
No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.
You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.
We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!
I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!
Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?
Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up!
