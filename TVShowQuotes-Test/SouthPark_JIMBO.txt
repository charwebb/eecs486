Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?
We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!
They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'
Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!  
I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!
Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.
Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.
Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew.
You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.
Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park.
Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. 
Yes?  Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?  Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.
Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!  Ih-it's comin' right for us! 
I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park Alumni.
No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.
Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!
You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.
W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.
Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.
Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!
Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?
Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order.
But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!
