Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?
See now with a "stand your ground" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.
What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there! 
We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.
No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.
Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew.
I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.
Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.
We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!  That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance! 
Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now...
What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!
You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again!
Well, it appears as though a lot of you "skeptics" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it!  There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!
But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?
It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.
Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. 
What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.
We just encourage them to find someplace better.
Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?
I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!
Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?
That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?
Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.  Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.
Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.  With that said, let's rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run?  Release the cows!  They're loose!
