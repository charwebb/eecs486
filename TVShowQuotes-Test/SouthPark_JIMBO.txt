Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.
Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.  One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.  Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.  There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!  Now, freeze it!  Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?
Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.
Well, sure. I mean, eh...  Well, no uh, I guess not.
Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.
Why the hell not? We're at war.  Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat.
Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?
Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick.  Blouach.
Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.
Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash.
Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.
Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
Give 'em hell Stanley!  Jesus, now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?
Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.
Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.
I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.
What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!
W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.
Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!  We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!
Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.
We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.
Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr.
Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.
We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like … fishing … sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.
Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.
