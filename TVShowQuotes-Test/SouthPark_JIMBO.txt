Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts.

Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!

Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! 

--no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, "thin out their numbers". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.  Uhh... So roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.

What do you see? 

We're gonna be all right!

I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.

Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy!

Satan. Got it.

Now THAT'S BOXING!

Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?

W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.

Hey, check it out! 

Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.

Yeah!

No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.

Play ball!  Steeeeee-riiike

That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!

Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.

Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, hehe.

What time is it, Barbrady?

Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.

Where to next, General?

Oh, finally!

Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.

Gotcha!

Oh crap!

Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!

No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.

No, because it's their history!

Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.  We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.

You sure?

Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!

What?!

We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards! 

The South wins!

No, dammit! The Aaaaah.

Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!

Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!

This one's yours Stan.  It's coming right for us.

He's back!

You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.

Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!

Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes! 

Oh. Yeah, we sure were.

Yeah! Woohoo!

Hey, he's saving us.

Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say "fag". 

Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again.

Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--

He's gay!!

Huh?

Bring it on, you bitch! 

You pansy! give me that gun.

What?!
