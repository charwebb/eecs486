What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!

Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!  Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!

All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. 

I want $500 on the South Park Cows.

No way! He barely touched him!

Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait... 

Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!

Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.

And that's the way it happened, boys.

Protect... the Denver Broncos.

It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!

Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert? 

How could Family Guy do that?

Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?  We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call "Pussy Law #4", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
("PUSSY LAW #4"
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE
BODILY HARM.)
In other words, our old line of, "It's comin' right for us"--

That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?

Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?

This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever in South Park from this day forth. Release the curtain! 

Yeah! Woohoo!

Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie! 

Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order.

Why, you little piece of crap!

Kern.

Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!

Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.

Can I help you?

Get outta the way, you damn hippie!

You know, Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah

Well Ned, we always kidnapped Middle Park's mascot. But this year we're gonna booby-trap it instead.  And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in Loving You, Boom!  No more Middle Park players. 

Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!

Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.

You what??

It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.

Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.  We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.

Yeah!!!

How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski? 

..."but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'"  Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.  Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!

Oh, boy, what a gorgeous day! 

Bye-bye!

You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again!

Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.

What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there! 

Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey!  It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! 

Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!

This is about history, kids.  If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  "politically correct." Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL!  And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?

Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.

Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!  

I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.  Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive. 

...You mean a person who's threatening you?

Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! 

Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.

Well, we draw straws.

Hey everyone, you need to see this! 

Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history.

Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?

I guess we drank it all.
