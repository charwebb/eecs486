I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is. 
Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.
No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?
Heh, some people are so picky about their towels
Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick.  But first, maybe I'll get a little high.  Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.
