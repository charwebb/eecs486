Hey everybody, how's it goin'?

But I thought you said-

Don't forget to bring a towel.

You're a towel!

Well calm down.

...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?

Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

Huh? Why not?

You're a towel.

Get away from me, you evil towel!

Awww.

Don't forget to bring a towel. 

Go away! I'm walking on sunshine!
