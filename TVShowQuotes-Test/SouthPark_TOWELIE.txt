Yeah!

Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.  Hello?

My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills.  And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways.  Except for one.  I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. 

Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-

Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.

Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah.

Huh?

I just... I just can't seem to stop.

So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... 

Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.

Where's what?

You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!

Hey it's been a long time!
