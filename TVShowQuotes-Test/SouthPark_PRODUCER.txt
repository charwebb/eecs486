Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?
No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!
Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!
Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. Weâ€™ll have the best in the business.
