Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us  unless they are stopped at the source!
Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere.  Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen. The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere. 
You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.
