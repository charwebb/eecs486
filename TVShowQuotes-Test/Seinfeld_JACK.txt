Hello Jerry,
So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?
(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
You are uh, thinking of staying here?
Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.
I did NOT have a coke.
Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
Yes, we will.
He gave it to me!
You're not me.
(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
