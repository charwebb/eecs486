Aaaaa! Lenny! 

Travis? Everything okay?

Nooooooooooo!

No. See, if I start to like you too much,  I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country.  Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again.  And that would devastate me.  So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny!
