Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.
Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
I already signed it. I was just showing you.
It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.
Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?
[sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital.
Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65.
[unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] 'Suck on this.'
That���s true. There���s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
I���ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
I heard about the hit.  Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?
I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts]
They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.
Yeah, Michael asked about it once. I just pretended not to hear him. He left.
Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.
I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
Okay, this isn���t over. Let���s stay focused, okay? ��We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?
Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now.
Oscar says I checked out huh?  Huh. [nods head]
Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...
[crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
