Really? You were gonna throw out a book?
Ryan, is, uh, dead.
It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.
[on speakerphone] Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time.
They don���t have vaginas.
Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..
Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry.
What did I do?
Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
I don't know, you?
Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
Who looks exactly like you.
[Warehouse Worker Frank remains silent, picks ear] You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
Yeah.
I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.
Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.
Good morning, Kelly.
You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
Yeah, hey.
Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
Yeah. I���ll stop by.
Well let me see... I would, uh...
Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
No, they bring it in.
That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...
There���s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
You know it���s not just pregnant women who don���t get their due. You know who���s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
Yeah, I���m���
Do you know her last name, yet?
Thank you!
We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
He might start by asking each of you, ���Why do you think you���re here?���
It's not.
Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
Look at.. Look at me. [laughs]
Great.
Hey, Brenda.
Hi Pam. Stay.
What?
Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
I have good cards.
Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck]
All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
Okay you know, this-- this is over.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
...minor points.
Are you gonna kiss me?
Well, no. He hates jams.
Look, you know, in any company  there's going to be certain degrees -
Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us.
[Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?
Well, that would be...
You solved it?
I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
[To Nellie in the kitchen] Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight.
What?
Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
What is going on here?
You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...
I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate.
What's going on?
That's not random.
Oop.
Give you a name or-
Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that.
[sobbing] It���s everything.
How?
Hey.
Yeah.
Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
Are you all right, Michael?
I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
You know, I actually lived in Honolulu for a year.
Oh, I don't know.
You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
Why wouldn't it--
Yes, it is your mistake. He���s lingering. So annoying. I���m gonna kill him. How can I help? I���m here.
Guys...
[whispers] That they do.
Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?  [laughs]  Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello? [sighs]
There���s two new guys back there with me now. They���re in their 20s. And we really get along.
I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
Dogs don't do that.
I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
If I won the lottery, I don't know. I don't think I'd make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone....
