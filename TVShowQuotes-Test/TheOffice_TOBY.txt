Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
No, No, No.  No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.
Hey I need to talk to you right now.
No.  It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
Well, uh, okay. Um.  It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a. [laughter from audience, Michael looks at camera unhappily]  Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where...
Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.
I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck]
We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry...
That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.
Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?
[spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.
All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.
[sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
This is great.  My ex-wife's going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.
Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw.
Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.
What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?
Yeah, Michael asked about it once. I just pretended not to hear him. He left.
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.
Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.
To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
Yeah, I assumed Michael was already doing this.  That's why I only use my personal e-mail account.
You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
[watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.
No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh...
