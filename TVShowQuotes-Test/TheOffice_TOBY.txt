It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away]
Yes, it is your mistake. He���s lingering. So annoying. I���m gonna kill him. How can I help? I���m here.
I already signed it. I was just showing you.
[standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?
Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...
You can't, [Michael touches his forehead and makes sizzling noise] Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
No, No, No.  No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.
I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
[sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
[on the computer] No, but I'm going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel.  Wo-woman's amazing...
Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.
It is real, thank you for saying that.
I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate.
Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]
Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements.
Ok, look the memo is not about you...
It's digital, so just take as many as you want.
Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.
I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
Honestly, I don't even hear her anymore. It's like waves crashing against the beach.
Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater.
Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh...
Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh...
Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?
Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
No.  It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
[on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
All right, well, let���s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn���t everyone stand? Okay, so... you���re being attacked. You���ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
It is enough of this. Everyone, let���s go back to work.
Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious.
I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ���cause they have to give you one month���s notice before they leave.
Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.
Think you could...[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing.  Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay.
