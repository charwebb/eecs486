I'm not processing this.
[laughs out loud] Excuse me.
I don't think the women in this office -
Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry.
Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to.
We want to go home.
Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right?
Yes.
I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!
Technically, he's right.
Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
Well, you know, 'cause of  the trains.
He didn't seem like he was joking.
Ah, pretty good. I finished.
Not really.
Sure.
Well, that has wheels.
I don't know. No.
Good morning.
Ok, you know, Michael...
Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
Well, that would be...
What are, are you doing at my desk?
Oh, Happy Birthday.
Fun?
Okay, okay, I'm going.
Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.
Just keep going.
Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
I'm allergic to mushrooms.
Tell me!
What?
Get over there!  Get over there!
Oh.
[whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.
Nothing.
There were two or three 'sorry's in there. [mumbles along with Nellie]
Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ���cause they have to give you one month���s notice before they leave.
[unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] 'Suck on this.'
Fine. Good.
[in feminine voice] And this is Sam.
This is a bloodbath. Alright, I���m calling this.
Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.
Really? She's dating?
...bones. What?
You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
Are... are you me?
Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]
Thanks Kelly.
All right, come.  Sit down, Dwight.
I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
I have very fertile hair glands.
Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back]
Come on, Michael. You're interrupting.
Yeah.
Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.
Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
Chicken piccata, side salad.
No, no.
I just want to...
[to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men���s prostates.
[Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?
Of course not!
Alright.
I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
Um, why don't you go ask him that?
Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.
[spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.
Did you?
Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
[excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
Okay, that is not true.
Yeah.
Yes.
Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
I know, Michael.
Oh, one more!
I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night [Pam holds up soda in salute, Meredith yells 'yeah!', Michael looks at camera] and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh...
What is going on here?
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
What?
Hey Kev.
