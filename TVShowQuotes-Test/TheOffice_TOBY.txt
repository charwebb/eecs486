[laughing] Happy's a funny word.
Can't you just not look at his feet?
Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture?
But I mean���uh have you talked to her? Is sh���
You don't need to write 'ex'.
We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.
Toby! Yeah!
Are you serious?
Okay, this isn���t over. Let���s stay focused, okay? ��We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
Michael wasn't invited.
Hey, where do I park?
Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back]
I know, Michael.
Ow! Ow!
Think you could...[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing.  Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay.
Really? She's dating?
That's not random.
I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
Really? Today?
Okay, this is what���s called pre-violent posturing.
Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
Guys...
I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night [Pam holds up soda in salute, Meredith yells 'yeah!', Michael looks at camera] and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh...
Thank you!
You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.
I think it's better that I...
That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.
I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?
Yes.
This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.
I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.
Sure.
Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
And I am Bacchus's friend!
I love The Finer Things Club.  My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.
[stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...
Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
You're-you're not in it.
I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. [whispers] Flenderson files.
She's going to be screaming her own last name?
Michael, it's almost 5:00.
Bye.
Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
Are you all right, Michael?
They do. That they do.
Any word on those time cards?
Come on.
It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
I don't know.
Okay. Good point...
I... I can't do that.
It's really not a big deal, Michael.
Yeah, I assumed Michael was already doing this.  That's why I only use my personal e-mail account.
Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
Umm... After my divorce. Yeah.
Me?
[Warehouse Worker Frank remains silent, picks ear] You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
So great.
Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
Well, it's for Angela, so ..
I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that.
Yes.
To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating.
You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?
No, No, No.  No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.
Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins]
I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
Oh, one more!
[on speakerphone] Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time.
Yeah.
Great point.
Don't make me be your pony, Kevin.
Yeah.
For you?
Not Jan.
Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- I'm-- I'm begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
At the gym.
Mmm-Hm.
Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow...
Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh]
Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?
Okay, then, Andy.
