Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?  [laughs]  Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello? [sighs]
[entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins]
We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
No.  It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that.
Well, uh, okay. Um.  It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a. [laughter from audience, Michael looks at camera unhappily]  Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where...
Oh, I don���t know. I might turn in early.
No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious.
Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
Pete���s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
[standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
Think you could...[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing.  Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay.
Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
[stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...
I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.
How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
These things just have a way of working themselves out.
Oh, yeah, no, it���s okay. I can handle it. Um, so���
Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
It���s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
You know, I actually lived in Honolulu for a year.
Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.
Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]
Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?
I���ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
