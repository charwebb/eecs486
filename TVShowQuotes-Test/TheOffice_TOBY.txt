Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It's in the section marked, 'Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.'
[Warehouse Worker Frank remains silent, picks ear] You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
[on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.
Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us.
[on the computer] No, but I'm going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel.  Wo-woman's amazing...
Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
Ok, look the memo is not about you...
It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...
Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you���re alive.
No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh...
This is a bloodbath. Alright, I���m calling this.
Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch.  And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.
Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
Can���t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
You know, I actually lived in Honolulu for a year.
Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-
No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
More like 'Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday.' [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away]
I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
Now, we���re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. [shakes head] Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
Well, uh, okay. Um.  It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a. [laughter from audience, Michael looks at camera unhappily]  Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where...
A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..
Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael]
Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.
That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.
Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk.
[nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... [Michael pushes Toby's food tray off the table and walks off]
I can refer you to someone to talk to.
And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
