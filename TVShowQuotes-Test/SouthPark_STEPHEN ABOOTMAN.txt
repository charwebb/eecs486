Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!

What do you think it means?!  We're striking, buddih! No more! That's it! Until we get what we want

Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands. 

Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance.

I'm not your guy, friend!
