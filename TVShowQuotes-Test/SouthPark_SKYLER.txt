Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla.

You're not putting out for me?

When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff.

Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God damnit!  Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night!  My guitar! NOOOOO!

Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?

Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly
