Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god  you found my fudge packing uniform...
No buts! If you want to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences!
That's it!  I'm suing this entire intolerant town!
By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule.  Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately. There'd never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since Beetlejuice. And, you put Johnny Depp and all the same crappy music in every film. And if you're that in love with Johnny Depp, then you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that!
