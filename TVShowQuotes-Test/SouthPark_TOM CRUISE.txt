Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of.
Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us.
No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?
We figured you're pissed at South Park too, right Mrs. Streisand?
