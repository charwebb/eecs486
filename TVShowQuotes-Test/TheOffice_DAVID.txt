Ever, ever...
Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
Michael--
Suck it. That's what it's called.
Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
What the hell?
Michael. I am very sorry.
Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well... You know what?  I'm sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?
Yeah?
I'll give it my best shot, Michael.
I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
Yep.
Yeah big time, yeah.
Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?
Dwight.
Hey Sweetie, what is it?
Shh.
Jim, good! You should hear this too.
What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael?
[on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?
We'll bring them both in.
You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Yes Michael, what is so urgent?
OK, was it Dwight?
You weren't supposed to tell anyone Michael.
Uh, you already have a new receptionist--
Uh, hey, I'm sorry.  I'm taking this out on you.
Sure.
Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
About 5,000.
Cheese platter?
You made a joke?
So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?
Well, okay. Great to meet you.
[on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.
