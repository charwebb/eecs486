OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
[playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier.
[on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?
Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.
Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li [bleep].  That's what it sounds like.
Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything.  If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?
Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.
I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.
You can't do that these days. You can't.
Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion.
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?
Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
