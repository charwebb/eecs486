Where do you see yourself in ten years?
I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.
Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh.
I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
Uh, hey, I'm sorry.  I'm taking this out on you.
And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything.  If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?
