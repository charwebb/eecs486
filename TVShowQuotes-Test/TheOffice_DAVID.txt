No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
I don't have any ideas for you there.
Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.
You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
[reading performance report]  'Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.'
Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
