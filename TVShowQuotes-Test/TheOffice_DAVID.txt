Stephanie, can you hop off please?
Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. [imitates vacuum] Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. [sucking noise] Picks it up!
I don't understand, is anyone hurt?
Has it?
Michael, is everyone okay?
No.
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
It's not.
Ummm... okay, here's the thing though.  The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.
Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.
Jim, good! You should hear this too.
No, ah it's okay Michael.  We got it.
Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?
Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion.
It's been crazy here.  You know I think you're doing a great job, right?
What do you think we could be doing better?
No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?
Okay.
Oh, Michael.
Yeah! Teddy!
[on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there���s a crisis -- the more I think about it --
And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.
Jan, glad you could make it.
Alan will be out too. All of us.
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
We didn't ask you to do that.
[singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone's on board.
You look great.
Okay, Michael.
OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...
Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Yeah big time, yeah.
