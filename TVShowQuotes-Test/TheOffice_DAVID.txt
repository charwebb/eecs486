Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]
Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...
Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li [bleep].  That's what it sounds like.
It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.
A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything.  If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?
No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh.
Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They���ve apparently just dropped the supplier they���ve been with for the last ten years. .
Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
Michael, I really don't know what's going on [police sirens in background] down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.
We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
