A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.
Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.
This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.
So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone's on board.
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They���ve apparently just dropped the supplier they���ve been with for the last ten years. .
No, ah it's okay Michael.  We got it.
