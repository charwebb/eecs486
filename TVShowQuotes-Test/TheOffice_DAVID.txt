No.
No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael.
Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
Andy!
Suck it. That's what it's called.
Yeah! Teddy!
Watch it Andy!
You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
[on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.
Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.
Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You're clearly a very bright guy.
[on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?
So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?
Michael?
Mmhmm.
[over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.
I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.
Really? [reading from phone] ���Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.���
What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
I believe we put you in charge.
I don't understand, is anyone hurt?
Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.
Very good.
No.
Hey guys, long time.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?
Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
I'm really looking forward to our interview.
[on phone] This is David.
What say we do.
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Okay.  Deal.  Okay?
