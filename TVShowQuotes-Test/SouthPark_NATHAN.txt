Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt.  Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!
Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts.
We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks.
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team.
That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet!  Wait a minute. What the hell are all those cars?  Holy shit! 
I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.
