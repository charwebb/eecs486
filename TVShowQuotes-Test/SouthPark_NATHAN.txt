I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being.
That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself!  AAAAAAAA!
That's great. I can't wait for camp this year.  We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?
Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!
Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.
Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?
Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?
