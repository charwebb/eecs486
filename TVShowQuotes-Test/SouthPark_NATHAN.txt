I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.

I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.

You just take one of these little blue babies  three times a day  and inject this directly into your bloodstream  twice a day before meals.

Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?

Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. 

His name is Timmy Burch.  And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.

That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself!  AAAAAAAA!
