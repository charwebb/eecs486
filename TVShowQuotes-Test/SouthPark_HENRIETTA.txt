So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.
Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.
So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?
Get out of our space, you little twerps!
