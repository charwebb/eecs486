My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.

I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.

Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!

Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
