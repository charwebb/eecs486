Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?

Eric, do you feel better about all this?

M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven.

M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me.

Oh no, not the Goddamned-

Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.

Could I get some more pork?

Alright, fine. Bring her in, Adler. 

M'kay, Bebe?

G'oh, m'kay.

The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!

Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay?  Hmm, come on. Be good, now. 

Yeah, Tuesday morning's good.

Getting acclimated?!  Do you know how much money we wated on that thing?! How about you take some damned responsibility! Get the hell out of here, Pat! You're fired! Get out!  Well. How the hell are we gonna clean up Pat's mess? I guess, I dunno, I guess we got no choice, m'kay. We're just gonna need to the upgrade to the IntelliLink Gold Package. 

Yeah, why d-uh, did you?

Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?

Ughuh...  Drinkin's bad.

No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estáran aqui. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)

Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.

M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.

Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful! 

Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.

Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-

Here you go, it's right in here. 

Whoa, wait! 

I want you. M'kay. 

Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, mkay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?

M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please? 

No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school!

Excuse me?

DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!

M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in "x = y + 1". Mkay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.

I sure did.

Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have. 

Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--

Oh no.

We're not bad. I mean, maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here. I mean, if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story.

His name is Toothuhkay! 

Mmkay.

M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!

Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside

Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?

Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?

Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh-  There! You just flipped me off again!

Hi, boys.

Yeah. Hmm. 

And still tells the world that we don't. 

No-uho-uho-uho!  Not o-uho-uhokay!

Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?

Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?

What the? They're all dead? Well, that means...

The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!

Are you boys stayin' out of trouble?

Alright now, get back to class! Adler, get rid of those laxative bottles! Trash all the Arby's horsey sauce packages too! There cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here!  What the?  Oh shit!  Stop that rat!

Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-

Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?

Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.

Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?

Okay...

You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?

Why, Mr. Freely?

Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle.

Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.
