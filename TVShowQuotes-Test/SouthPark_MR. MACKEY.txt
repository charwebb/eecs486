It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.
No helping!  M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay?
Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!
M'kay, now right-click on menu item "Equate O" and type in "input y".
More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!
Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh-  There! You just flipped me off again!
M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uhkay?
Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!
M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in "x = y + 1". Mkay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.
But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay? 
Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-
Why, sure.  Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm...  Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.
Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?
Yeah, a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal. M'kay?
Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!
Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, mkay?
Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 
Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?
Getting acclimated?!  Do you know how much money we wated on that thing?! How about you take some damned responsibility! Get the hell out of here, Pat! You're fired! Get out!  Well. How the hell are we gonna clean up Pat's mess? I guess, I dunno, I guess we got no choice, m'kay. We're just gonna need to the upgrade to the IntelliLink Gold Package. 
After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn.
With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!
Sorry, Kyle, we're gonna need to maybe go somewhere else. Uh... find an IntelliLink panel somewhere.
I think this will be very good for you 
All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? .
Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.
Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking!
Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?
Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken.
That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?!  I'm sorry about this, but it's gone too far! I've had it! Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior!
Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.
I want you all to take a serious fucking look at yourselves! M'kay?! Act I was pure fucking dogshit! If Tooth Decay is singin' flat, then the whole fuckin' thing sounds flat! Wuhkay?!
Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it.
Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea...
Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.
Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.
M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics?
Now Wendy, I've tried to be patient with you 'cause you've always been a good student! M'kay?! But calling a little girl fat and ugly is NEVER n'kay!
Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?
You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay? 
Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.
