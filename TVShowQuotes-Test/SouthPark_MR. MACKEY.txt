Getting acclimated?!  Do you know how much money we wated on that thing?! How about you take some damned responsibility! Get the hell out of here, Pat! You're fired! Get out!  Well. How the hell are we gonna clean up Pat's mess? I guess, I dunno, I guess we got no choice, m'kay. We're just gonna need to the upgrade to the IntelliLink Gold Package. 
Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik. 
Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?
We are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, Eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!
Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weight-management camp?
M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas.
Kids? Kids, okay, I need to talk to you about a serious matter.  You probably all noticed my orange wristband , mkay? It's to show my solidarity with the people of Belarus.  Mkay, you should know that the Belarusian government is right now trying to-
Estoy seguro que llegáran. Eh-solo poquito mas de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)
All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? .
Oh, good point.  No, I don't feel any d-oooohh...  Oh, baby, get down, m'kay?
Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-
Well, I've said all I can say.  I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay?  Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison.  Don't lose... your son, m'kay? 
Wokay, in fifteen fucking minutes you all are not gonna care about this anymore, so I'll just say what I need to say. That was the worst rehearsal we have ever had! We are two days away from opening and you're all fuckin' around!
I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay? 
Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--
We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts. 
Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?
Yuh-NO!  You may have won this time, Mr. Hat.
And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war. 
We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.
There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, "How far will I go to save my son's life?"
It's over, Stanley. What else can we do?
I want you all to take a serious fucking look at yourselves! M'kay?! Act I was pure fucking dogshit! If Tooth Decay is singin' flat, then the whole fuckin' thing sounds flat! Wuhkay?!
And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!
M'kay... that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich.
Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.
Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?
M'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, last week I told you to write down any difficult questions you had and put them in this box anonymously so we could discuss in class, m'kay? I got a lot o' responses, so let's read some aloud.  "Mr. Mackey is gay."  Okay kids, that is not funny! M'kay?! This box is supposed to be used for serious questions! About, about serious issues! M'kay, let's let's stop the tomfoolery!  M'kay, this looks like a real one here.  "Dear Mr. Mackey, you are gay."  All right, all right. That's enough, kids. Let's quiet down and try to be mature, 'kay?  Uh here we go. Okay, "Mr. Mackey, sometimes my parents hit me, and you are gay."  dammit, is there not one serious question in here?!  "Mr. Mackey is gay, Mr. Mackey is gay"  Okay, here.  I am a boy at South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when I'm sitting in class, my penis becomes hard for no reason. What should I do?  All right kids, all right kids, that's enough!  If you all can't be serious about the question box,  then we'll just do drug identification exercises, unkay?!
Every year the fourth graders do "The Miracle Worker," and every year I have to sit and watch it.
Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?
BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison. 
Yeah, a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal. M'kay?
No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems.  M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do uh, four time four, m'kay?
Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
No!  Go away!  Stan, you need to do something about your friend, mkay.  Get him out of here before he hurts anybody!  Mkay?
Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?
Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust?
Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?
Uh, "commend" means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?
The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
