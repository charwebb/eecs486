Hey that's right. Corey Duran killed himself last year and we're STILL dealing with the fallout. Maybe there is a way out of this. But we're gonna have to throw Eric Cartman under the bus.
No war, m'kay?! No war, m'kay?! Oh uh, here you go, boys.  These will help you protest. It's good to see that you care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war, m'kay?!
I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, "Attention Deficit Disorder," or ADD. It's very common in kids his age.
Okay, let's see, lights.  Mood.  Start counseling timer.  Okay there we go. Okay, we got it.  Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?
Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- 
Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.
Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!
M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics?
Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?
Well he was technically standing his ground, Token.
Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future.  M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink.  Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal.  M'kay...  You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school.  Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on "school clinic" Mkay, see nurse. M'kay. Respiration problems.  Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay.  It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board.  Mesage... board.  Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance,  here we go. Here's a message from Kyle's little brother, Ike Broflovski.  Okay, little Ike says "My brother is a homo" Ike made a little drawing of his brother too.  Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off Kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice.  It's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off Kyle's head there.
Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. 
Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
…and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?  No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.  Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney…
Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. 
And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war.
Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Token?
Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 
Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother?  "Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk." She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? 
Well yeah, but see, the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet.
Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay? 
What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.
M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place?  Uh, how about you, Clyde?
But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?
All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay?  Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! 
Okay.  Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?
Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about "sexual molestation", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality.
We get a bus... and then we... throw Eric Cartman under it.
Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?
Oh, well uh w-we think that bullyin' is... is, is bad... m'kay, and uh, and when we see bullying in the school, we tell the students, you know, that... uh that that's bad. m'kay?
Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job.
You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave.
You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay? 
Well, I've said all I can say.  I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay?  Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison.  Don't lose... your son, m'kay? 
Hold it, hold it, stop!  What. The fuck. Was that?
Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay?  Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.
Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.
Well, guess what, boys? I think that "Getting Gay With Kids" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.
