M'kay, now right-click on menu item "Equate O" and type in "input y".
You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay. 
Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
Oh you're trying! You call rolling your fat ass out on the stage and lazily blurting out your lines like a turtle takin' a shit, you call that tryin'?! This play is supposed to change  how people think, Kyle! Get it fucking right!  Pick it up from there!
No, Clinton's vice-president.  He is here today to talk to you students about some very serious issues. Please welcome Al Gore. 
And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!
I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again.
Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an "accident" while you were "drinking" on a "hike," "N'kay!"
But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.
Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me.
Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
…and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?  No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.  Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney…
And that's exactly why you need to go!
Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?
Attention students, m'kay? There will be a presentation by the special education department in the gymnasium Friday during lunch and recess, m'kay? Attendance to this assembly is mandatory. All students and faculty are required to go. Uh which, which I guess means I gotta suck it too, huh? Uh huh, m'kay.
Well you'd better not! Because let me tell you some'n' about smokin'!  Uh, smokin's bad, m'kay.  And uh, if you start smokin' at an early age, m'kay, ih it's gonna be bad.  M'kay, because uh, smoking can lead to all kinds of health problems like cancer.  M'kay, and let me tell you something about cancer, m'kay. Cancer's bad. M'kay, and uh, eh, what?  What the?  Holy shit! M'kay?! 
Well that's your side of it, Token, but you know Eric has his side as well. Have you thought about maybe writin' him a poem? M'kay? Write E- write Eric a poem, tell him how you feel.  You know, m'kay? Well I'm tellin' you, Token, you let it go, and he'll let it go, and it'll all be fine. Can ya?
No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes.
If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?
Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia.
Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llegá- llegáran. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)
Now, now, Tooth Decay, your character is supposed to be mean and nasty. M'kay. Stop cryin'.  Nono. See, Tooth Decay can't be sad until Toothbrush and Dental Floss have gotten rid of him. You can't just start already sad; there's nowhere to go. Besides, there's no arc. M'kay. Oh for crying out loud! Alright, alright Tooth Decay, you just go home and sort yourself out! The rest of us will rehearse the finale again! And you'd better come back tomorrow with a different attitude, Tooth Decay! M'kay?! 
No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay. 
Boys, what are you doing back here?  I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?!
Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? "The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-"
Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. Nde no no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. Yeeu be passive, mkay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now.
We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home!
Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-
We have plenty enough to save our town now!
Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.
The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
No! There's no more upgrades, m;kay?! I just want this  to work!
Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. 
Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?
Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. 
I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! 
I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong.  I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik.
I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
Hey that's right. Corey Duran killed himself last year and we're STILL dealing with the fallout. Maybe there is a way out of this. But we're gonna have to throw Eric Cartman under the bus.
Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?
Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?
