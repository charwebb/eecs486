Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay?

Just a minute to go in the first quarter. 

M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks.

You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room.  Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at!  Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll! 

Uh, no Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit.

M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?

M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?

Hold it, hold it, stop!  What. The fuck. Was that?

Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria.  I think I may know what the problem is. 

Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?

Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- 

Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.

Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.

I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! 

Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.

That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. 

Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?

That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?!  I'm sorry about this, but it's gone too far! I've had it! Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior!

And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war. 

Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.

Nuh-now, who was that?  That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?

Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.

How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!

Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.

DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!

Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!

Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like "penis" and "vagina."  Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay.  Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum.  STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh...  let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm.

I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man!  You get sent here every day, Craig!

Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother?  "Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk." She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? 

Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela , the school janitor. Okay?  He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face!  So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!

Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?

Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?

Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded.  Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.

Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,

Okay, can somebody get me some paper towels?? Or maybe a  Ooowww, okay!  Ooohhh, it's bad!

Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking!

It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? 

Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.

Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?!

Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about "sexual molestation", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality.

Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?

Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off.
