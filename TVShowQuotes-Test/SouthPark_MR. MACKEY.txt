But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?

Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.

What? Oh, thanks, man.

Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.

Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle.

M'kay, that sounded great, kids. 

Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.

M, m'kay

Kyle Broflovski! Do you mind telling me where your brother is?!

M'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay?  I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?

Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 

Oh, hell yes!

The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!

Billy. Billy Thompson?

Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?

All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? .

Uh, no Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit.

M'kay, Bebe?

I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! 

M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please? M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet ple-mk-m'kay?  M'kay. Uh, now kids, we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking, m'kay? So please give a very big South Park Cows welcome to, "Butt Out!" 

Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.

Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?

Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?

Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you?  Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay?

Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?

So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all.  Do the other kids make fun of ya?

Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!

M'kay.

Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?

Mkay?

It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything.

Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do?

Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?

M'kay, that's good!  Let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade!  Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal!

-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay. 

Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?

It's simply asking too much.

Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.

Here she comes! Here she comes!

Um. How's he doing, nurse?

Oho... Oh God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!

Mad enough to kill, Kyle??? 

Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college. 

Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, mkay?

Hm huheh, that's okay. 

That's probably gluten, m'kay?

Ughuh...  Drinkin's bad.

Okay...

Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?

Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea...

Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again.

Shh! M'kay?

M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?

You know that's not the point!

Ji-Jimmy?

Yeah, me too.

Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside

Why, Mr. Freely?

Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows.

Well why the hell didn't you say so! Come on, let's go!

Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks is bad, Eric.

Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like "penis" and "vagina."  Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay.  Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum.  STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh...  let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm.
