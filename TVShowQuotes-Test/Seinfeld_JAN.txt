What?
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
Wha... excuse... why not?
And you had a luau....
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
Ok.
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
I don���t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
On a what?
Yes, of course, I know Kelly.
Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...
Okay.
Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed.
Is it really that important to you?
Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
I just think that...
Michael---
Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
Step away from me, Michael.
Excuse me?
You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that?
Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
No, Dwight; come in.
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
Get yourself down stairs.
Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
Well, I'm glad you did it, Michael.
[on speakerphone with Michael] Michael.
Hey you!
Great!
Who is this?
[sigh] Is Toby there?
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
All right. Let's talk about clothing.
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
What did you say, Michael?
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Oh!
The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.
What the hell are you two talking about?
It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Today?
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
Oh, hey!
Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
So, what's Ryan doing here?
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
Well it was good to see you.
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
Good.
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
[singing] What did you learn?
You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
Do you want to look at mine?
You are not allowed in this session.
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Don't date Holly.
Michael.
You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
Period.
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
It's... it's about talent.
Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Did you take care of the situation?
No, it's not possible.
We saw Wicked.
How is that a business question?
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
Michael.
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.
Hi.
Hey. I'm leaving.
