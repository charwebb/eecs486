Where is he?!

Hai.  Kore ga arimasu. 

Yes, of course!

Yes. But he was also a prophet... who knew the secret truth about the nature of life.

Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room.  As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible.  That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.

Please, understand, we just want what is best for your son. The reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard must be taken care of. He had many enemies.

And so it is with great pride that we have flown little Billy Thompson out here, to be reunited with his parents for the first time in twenty years.  Mrs. Garthunk?
