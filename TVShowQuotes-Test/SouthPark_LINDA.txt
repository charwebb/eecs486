Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.
It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.
What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??
That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.
Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! 
Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?
Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. 
I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!
Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? 
Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?  You are grounded, mister!
Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?
Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!
Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.
