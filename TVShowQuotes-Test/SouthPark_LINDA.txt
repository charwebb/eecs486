Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?

My God! Mark!  What is it??

All right, you win.

You made a goofy face!

Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?

Puerto Rican.

J mart?

You just march on in there.

If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? 

With you where?

Little girl, you shouldn't be working here.

Butters, what have you done to your hair? 

Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?

Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!

You... have a girlfriend, Butters?

Oh God, Mark! Help! 

Excuse me, I didn't catch that.

We made it, We made it!

Way to go, champ.

AAAAAAAAH!! 

What is it, Stephen?

Steven, what do we do?

Butters? 

That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?

What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??

What's going on?

No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.

I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!  Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- 

Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.
