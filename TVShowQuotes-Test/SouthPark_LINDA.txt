Puerto Rican.

Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. 

No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive.

Stephen!

Hi Butters.

Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.

Butters? Butters?!

Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?

Friends, by default. 

No!  Our son is dead!

Anything, Stephen?

Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!

No,  I didn't hear about that.

We aren't honestly considering this?

A what?

Butters, what are you doing?

J mart?

Butters, what happened to your eye?

Mark!

Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?

We made it, We made it!

Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!

Oh, Chris. 

What's going on?

I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. 

Uh, uh...

Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? 

How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?

Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.
