Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.
No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive.
Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!
I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. 
Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. 
Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?
Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?
Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?
Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.
It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.
What on earth is the matter with him?
The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.
I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
