...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?
Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.
Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.
He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.
Hey, I think you'd make a great father.
Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! 
Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?
I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. 
Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.
Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?
A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??
