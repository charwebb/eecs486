No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? 

I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!

Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.

Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.

Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.

Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?

We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!

Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.

I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. 

What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!

Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?

The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.

Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe.  I just love the cute little canarian on the dial. And, every hour it chimes.
