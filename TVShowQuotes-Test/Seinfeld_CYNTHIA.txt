I said to him, "I really appreciate this, but I just got my period." And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--
Kenny Bania.
See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.
Is he nuts?
