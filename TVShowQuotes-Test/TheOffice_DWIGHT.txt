Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end.
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
[typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
I gave her a higher clearance than you.
No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
[picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
So what do you need me to do?
Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here���s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
How much longer is this going to take?
Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
[Reading from computer] ���Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!��� That means you can't make me do squat.
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
Can I get you a tankard of mead?
[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You���re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark���s shoulder]
[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
I do not!  I do not say 'Hi' Pam!
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
You know where it is. Lead me there.
[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
And they said it couldn���t be done. Boom!
I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.
[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
Thank you. I���m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
I need to make a sales call.  Please?
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
You won���t stop until you���ve poached us all.
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor]
I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]
No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
Yes. Fast food. I���ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.
If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
Well something's come up, I have to go.
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it���s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here���s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]
What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don���t even care about nationals.
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
And this chair���s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound]
I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.
Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
Come up with a statement in the next hour....
But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
[eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]
Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
I can tell. I won't let you down.
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
That place doesn���t exist. It���s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That���s not true.  Just give me another chance.
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we���ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
So I���ve got your resume here, but it���s not telling me everything.
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They���re not for me. They���re for my cousin Mose. He���s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
And you want me to come with you.
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
No no no, I can't let you do this!
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.
You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
She���s got a ton of great qualities. She���s young, she���s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we���re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn���t technically incest.
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]
Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I���m back.
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
Oh my God, we have to be there.
Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
You were making me do things that were not all right.
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]
Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.
Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.
You know what? I made you a cd...
Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
[interrupting] ��� lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't...
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
I need to go over some details with you.
What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
The buyer is your sister���s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that���s an order.
Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices]
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He���s gonna be moving slowly. It���s only���
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?
I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]
No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ���em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
What do you think?  You've got an hour.
[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
They are either going to say yes... or no.
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
I would make sure that you were dead.
I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
[puts his grandmother���s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
Nice to see you. May I hold him?
That doesn���t sound crazy, Jim. That���s the sanest thing I���ve ever heard.
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]
So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
It was nothing personal. It���s just that you were terrible at your job.
[yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Well, the alert was already set to ���Red��� because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ���Double Red���?
Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
