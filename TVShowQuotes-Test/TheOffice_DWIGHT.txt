Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
[singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
I will. I will. You need to calm down.
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
We all have a hero in our heart.
I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
I don't want people making fun of my nose.
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
Andy I���m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that���s great.
Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
[changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]
[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
Maybe over a beer after she���s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
[taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.
Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.
Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]��� Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He���s gonna be moving slowly. It���s only���
And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
... is there any news on the leads?
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
This is not a test! Can you leave?!
I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: There���s a madman in our midst.
Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now.  She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning 'Love,' and adelph, meaning 'Adolf.' 'the city that loves Adolf.' Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...
I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
No. I���ll be damned if I���m gonna let us lose me.
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
[yawns, ���Idiot��� is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.
Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
It���s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I���ve ever made.
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
I put everything back in the vending machine.
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
You need to do something about your B.O.
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
Listen to me! I love you! And I don���t care that Phillip���s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
How long has he been in the bathroom?
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You���re gonna watch me right?
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
[scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ���
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
[clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance.
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
I���m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]
No, but we should discuss that another time.
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let���s go!
Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
This interview is over. I'll let you know.
Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!
No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He���s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I���m hesitant. Why can���t I pull the trigger on any of them?
Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?
[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?
In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]
No, you���re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ��L--
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's...
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?
[laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Oh, we do. So we���ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
And this chair���s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review.
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!
Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That���s Lloyd.
The bride and groom? What are their names?
Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
Oh no, I���m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
I want him to have all the urine he needs.
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
Hey. Come on, buddy. Let���s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don���t compare. When you���re with the R-O-L-F, you���re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
Hoist him aloft. C���mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]
No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
It would be better if you were unconscious.
[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
