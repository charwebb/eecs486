For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
I could, but I just don���t feel like it loser.
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
Let���s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
But the little cars go in the compact spot!
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
Boo, unimpressed. It���s a tightrope for babies. Boo!
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
That is a damnable lie. I love women.
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
Daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare���s milk?
For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.
Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I���ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I���m telling you... if you don���t do this, [whispers] I don���t stand a chance. Please, Jim.
It���s a youtube thing! Let���s go. Let���s go. Come on, they���re coming.
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We���re running late. Let���s get him inside.
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he���s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet���.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]
Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.
[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, 'that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.' And I said, 'I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.' Well, hello Danny!
Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]
Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn���t on the itinerary.
Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
Shhh, Pam. C���mon, don���t be such a right-sider.
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.
I have to put you on with my boss.
Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.
Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
Are you really not going to punch him?
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
All we can do is sit and wait.
[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
You think I don���t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I���ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne���er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don���t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
I���d have to get some more wire and string, but it���s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.
Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?
[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.
I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]
[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it���s an idea. But what does it mean?
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
[raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.
We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I���m gonna like it.
Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis]   You want half a sandwich?
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they���re protecting America���s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day���s security codes. Something that���s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It���s not the KGB, but it���s a start.
It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don���t lie. I can tell if you���re lying.
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It���s gonna be fine. It���s gonna be fine. There���s plenty of Pyramids.
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
Well, we���re both just kinda learning as we go, aren���t we?
Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.
Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?
Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let���s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man���s closet.
No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts?
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
No! No, Oscar. He���s a friend. He���s a friend.
Open the gates! There���s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There���s plenty for everyone!
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]
He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I���m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?
[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the 'trappings' of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane���s coming.  I suppose you���re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk]
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'
Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that���s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]
Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]
Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
All their top clients I can't believe it.
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let���s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let���s go.
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
No, no, don't, don't tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ��� What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
Oh, you think they���re my only friends? I���ve got way more friends than that, and they���re all better than the losers who work here.
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]
Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It���s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I���d be happy to see Jim as manager.
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
Who was the second man on the moon?
[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
Why would I put a banana in my holster?
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
I put everything back in the vending machine.
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.
Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
I know how we can learn his tricks.
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
[sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.
The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There���s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ���the White Whale���. Look at all that sweet blubber.
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.
Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
Excuse me, I got a question for you.
It's a job interview, not a flea market.
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.
Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list]
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
