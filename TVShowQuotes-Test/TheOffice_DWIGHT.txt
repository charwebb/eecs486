Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Ready?
Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
Yes.
[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute.
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
Yes!
God.  Where is Jim?
Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
It's called a costume.
[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
Steak. Rare.
...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
Okay, how's that?
Loyalty.
Torture.
No, I like Meredith.
Okay.
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
Oh, that's funny.
[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.
Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
That goes directly to the tester.
I got a splinter.
[whispering] You're gonna blow it.
No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
[Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
Okay, now here���s the plan. I���m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Which one is it?
Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard.
Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]
I'm gonna set your face on fire.
Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!
I���m trying to make him feel important.
Eh.
Make him be quiet.
It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts]
This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]
I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
uhhhh....no one.
I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
I don't get that, I don't understand that.
It worked.
[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
...to consolidate power.
Okay scram, wizard.
Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
I need to make a sales call.  Please?
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
[to camera] Same thing.
So, let's get it going.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
But that's illegal.
Sex.
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
You know, you���re right! We hadn���t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]
I will pay you whatever it takes.
I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]
Dumatril!
Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
I have to do something to his eyes.
Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
Ok, Pam, thanks.
They fall under the category of airplanes.
Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
Will never be her name.
Very funny, Jim.
Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
[sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Drink it!
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
That is not in the contract.
I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that.
Jim!
Awesome!
I decided earlier.
Hey, Toby.
Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.
God... Damn it! Why us?
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
Damn It!
No. [typing on keyboard]
It's the ladies' room.
Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.
No thanks I'm stuffed.
Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
Her kid needs shoes, Jim!
But you work tomorrow.
[groans] Stop moving!
Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
Hello, Jan.
Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
I���d love to be in the loop, David.
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]
Oh D.
Told you.
He turned over my...
Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
You can be so modest sometimes.
And then I inserted my penis-
[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]
[bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
Three...
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
Absolutely not.
Just a chocolate shake, chocolate sprinkles.
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
Based���on his merit.
Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?
There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
K. I brought cheese too.
Do you have your money belt?
No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
Jim talked too much.
Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
I'm on it.
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
Really?
It's from Battlestar Galactica.
[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
[clears throat] 'I state my regret.'
Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
You're an idiot.
It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]
[re-entering the store] I'll take the wizard!
Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
That's an exaggeration.
RAHHH!!!!!!!
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?
Maybe over a beer after she���s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
Very impish.
By any means necessary?
You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
Just a formality.
May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
[nods to camera]
Keep the wing flaps.
All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
Where are you?
What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous.
Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.
Pull over!
I do. But you married my worst enemy.
Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]
Well, that didn't go well.
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie���?  Lick the spoon?
What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.
Hello. Jim?
Let me out.
[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.
Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby]
Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
You came into my office voluntarily.
[shouting] Haulin' cube!
Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
Hmm.
At what time?
What is this?
May I please speak to your boss?
No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
I'm busy.
I'll ask you a question.
[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.
Aaaaaaaa!
Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I'll install it on your computer.
Outside of work.
And wake up in the future.
You snubbed her.
So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
Yes.
The White Pages.
Jim���wha��� Come on! What���what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.
[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
[laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
I want an answer by tomorrow.
Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
That's debatable.
Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
Got 'em. Go!
I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
Like this? Watch.
Definitely.
How do you know that?
Big smiles folks! There they are.
Mmm hmm.
[whispers] Coolio.
Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here.
No one just called you.
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Check out Dental?
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
Now watch, let me take you from behind.
I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
No no no the first part.
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
Are you socialist?
Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
No, everything's fine.
Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
What? Something happened?
Not doing that.
Okay. Fine.
Ohh.
Erin [eerie voice] Erin...
Do you want to do this right or not?
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It���s gonna be fine. It���s gonna be fine. There���s plenty of Pyramids.
Okay.
I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
[Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]
You���re welcome.
[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
What? I believe it.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
You needed to speak to me?
I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
It���s true.
[laughing] Boom!
When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Tell me where it hurts.
[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
Everybody loves beets.
They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
Anything else?  Flint...
Hmm?
No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
Did he threaten you?
Okay. Come on! Jim!
Kill or be killed.
Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin]
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
I know you did it!
Exactly.
Argggg!
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier���s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
[scoffs] Vaccines are for chumps!
Mm-hmm.
Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
Stay out of this, you!
No.
More like, 'Aye, aye, General.'
OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.
Aww, Darryl.
Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
I found it under the seat.
Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot.
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
No, it's not.
[pantless] OK, how is my voice now?
Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]
I have to see these shoes.
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
You have to tell me.
He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
This is stupid! Cut.
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Ok, what is going on here?
Um.
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Exactly.
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
It's a miracle.
Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put
What?
[sighs] Please? Please?
.. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]
Welcome.
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
[seething] Holly, you approved this?
Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
I don't want people making fun of my nose.
And he made us all look like chumps!
If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
Mm-hmm. Good safe?
[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
What do you think you're doing?
Not coming, have plans.
Just now.
Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
I know. I know exactly what to do.
I really don't think so.
Okay! Come on!
Watch and learn.
What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]
Really?
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
On his mother's grave.
[struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
Give me that.
No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]
There's so much more to it than that.
Wha ��� what is this supposed to be?
Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
Please?
[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
[trumpet sounds]
Well, I'm not done yet.
Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
This has to do--
Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
Gonna get it?
[moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention]
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]
Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.
What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
I can handle that.
No! [waves arms] Pam, I'm over here!
Yeah I���m serious.
[shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]
Danny Cordray is the worst.
Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
That is not true.
Ahh!
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
What kind of mortgage did you get?
Clark has no chance. I mean, he���s up against my buddy Rolf, for God���s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ��� he���ll make you laugh so hard, you���ll puke your pants.
You're a secretary! What do you know?
But then you wouldn't have me here.
I asked you a question.
[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight]
No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
Alright.
Psssh, no.
I thought he was out on the road.
Oh, yeah. Yes!
What is the matter with... me?
The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
Wow. So much crap. It���s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?
[lets go] Good morning.
Right. Okay? Great.
Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!
Yours doesn't.
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.
Hmm. It wasn't here before.
You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
You read my mind.
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
But the little cars go in the compact spot!
I saw that. That's great!
Cradle my head!
It doesn't make any sense.
Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand]
Ok. Who reports to who?
Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
I'm not good at jokes.
[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn���t even know it. I���ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
I think I should be there.
Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Oh, man!
He is a goner.
Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
Hey David.
What's this?
[enters quickly] You need my pitchfork?
Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
That's impossible.
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.
Get out of my way. Huh!
-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then.'
Thanks, Michael.
Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
You're back. [surveys Andy] And you're disgusting.
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ���
Hey monkey.
Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?
In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
Yeah!
I want to do it.
You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
I don't wanna move desks!
Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist]
[at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side.
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
Oh yeah?
I can see that happening.
Later on.
Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
Yes, Michael.
No, he shouldn���t.
Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They���re extraordinary.
Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no��� Freak, I need a favor.
Hey, you're making me spray!
Very good.
No word from Michael.
[counts down in French]
Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]
He was dead the whole time.
Was that your per diem?
Kiyah!
Michael! Michael!
Of course you are.
...for people's behavior.
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
It's a mini-briefcase.
Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
So what do we know about her?
Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
Andy���[knocks] I need to talk to you.
Uh huh.
You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.
What is your name, sir?
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?
Vagina and-
But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
I might see a movie.
That's right.
I've only had to use it once.
Are you enjoying your mineral water?
Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
You���re bad.
Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
No.
Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
Oh, yes, we do.
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
I can't... [starts running]
To keep secrets from my computer.
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
You don't keep a diary.
Sly dog.
Who? Dave Barry?
Troy!  What are you doing here?
It's going very well.
No.
Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Yeah, you know me.
Had 'em all my life.
That's my client.
You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief]
Remember?
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
Okay, I'll drive.
[raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.
You're number four.
Don't say cow- Ugh.
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don���t lie. I can tell if you���re lying.
Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Damn it!
Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What���s going on Nellie? Talk to me.
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick]
And 'Breaking Corporate News.'
We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!
Fine.
Right over by that fence.
If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
Bet you I got mine for less than yours.
We'll see.
Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
Eight minutes!
On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.
Thank you, Angela.
Y el accento, donde are you from?
[Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
All right. Sounds good.
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Get in the back.
I don't follow.
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is���for���Kevin.
[tries to climb human pyramid] Ahh!
Why would Michael give you one before me?
I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
One more. To our boss!
[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please.
Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
Hey.
Mine was green.
He says Thank you.
[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
You���re a good assistant, Jim.
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
Michael. Michael?
[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
It���s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we���re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
Fine. Get outta here.
Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
Okay that's-
Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
Gabe? You don't know?
No.
Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
[finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
[waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael's office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this?  Jan?
Oh, man, it's really back there.
All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
Power.
Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
And it's-
[with conviction] Start the party.
We could do it in the warehouse.
The Crow.
OK, what's up?
Right, that's good, good, pursue this.
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
-Cornell Application Department,
[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
No.
I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
Only one way to find out.
I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.
Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.
Not so weak, huh, Mom?
The warmth will lure people inside.
Three.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Hustle!
Fumble! Yaaah!
Wait, so you���re the boss?
He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
Do you want to die? OUT!!
K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight���s desk]
No thank you.
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]
Don't leave us!
Yes!
No! You���re not helping, Trevor!
Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.
Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]
Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
I can���t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
Hey, how's it going, man?
That's it.
Michael, it's time.
That-
Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
OK you are useless.
Jim!
What are you writing about me?
Well don't look so surprised.
Don't make me fire you.
Michael would never let me...
You have till five.
Yeah...
I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.
Oh, really? Uh-huh.
There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!
Get in.
My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
[whispering] He's my best customer.
Not��� significant is a big word���
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
You took that with you.
Try me.
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
Visual aids.
I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...
You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
[whispering] I want some of those pills.
Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Downsizing?
What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
Oui.
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
Let's go!
It's uh, it's in beta testing.
Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
No. Putting a load on more like it.
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
You have information about the sex predator?
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
I didn't order anything.
[laughs] With sex!
[holding mini-fan]  It slipped.
I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
What would you have done? Been manager?
Cmon.
You got this kosher certified?
You���re being disrespectful!
Yeah.
What do you think history is?
Pam.
[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what���s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you���re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?
Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
How do I apply?
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
Andy! Leapfrog! [Andy leapfrogs Dwight]
What are you doing?
Yep, he's lying.
Command central.
Still an important position. Still a chief.
Creed! Come on. Stanley!
And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
Doesn't matter.
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
[imitating '80s rock]
So we're choosing...
Come on.
