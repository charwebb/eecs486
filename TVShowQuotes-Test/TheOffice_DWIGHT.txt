Get in the van.
Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
I chose my words very carefully.
You don't work with us.
[bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
Is this your car, Ryan?
No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
Battlestar Galactica isn't a documentary exactly.
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
[looking into his coffee mug] What the hell?
Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
Do this. Come on. Ready?
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
Oh, man, it's really back there.
I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?
[stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!
Ahhh.  Mweehaa
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
Menstrual cycles.
I've had intercourse in the office.
Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
Good, do you see what I'm saying?
Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
Well...
Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling]
Hey.
Let's go check out the master bedroom.
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
Andy! [Jim mimes basketball shot]
I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]
You���re not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
I don't want people making fun of my nose.
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Please?
I got a splinter.
I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
Dale Raymond Corson!
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
What is going on?
A little eye for an eye action.
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
What's your win rate?
It's in my purse.
I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
It's early bird gets the worm.
Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.
It is?
Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
You'll fall in love with her.
Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
I'm sorry.
You know what? I'm a little busy.
Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
Bet you I got mine for less than yours.
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
Now, listen,...
Say no more.
Can I have an office?
Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.
Oh, man!
Well, this is it.
You know we live together, right?
[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]
Yes!
Very smart.
Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.
Welcome.
I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.
Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.
Ryan.  Come on, man?
When is the Paleolithic Age?
You must use a lot of paper.
As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you���re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
Ahh! OK!
Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.
Go on.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Want to take a rake... .
This is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...
Oh, come on. I���ve never heard of such a thing.
Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight]
Come on.
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
[lays on bed] Really?  I hadn't noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
OK, I accept it.
Very well.
I was wondering-
The Sting. The Sting.
Great idea.
Uh-huh.
I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
Psh, why is that great?
Yeah.
No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
Yeah!
Hungry?
No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
Found him!
Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
That's unacceptable.
Okay!
No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
Please Ja, Ja... [Jan hangs up]
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office]
Wait, shut up.
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
That's a total waste of your 'M.'
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
Yes! As your representative?
I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
What?
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
On his mother's grave.
If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!
I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]
They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
[laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
Well���no, no���n���
[seething] Holly, you approved this?
Terrible!
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
He is.
There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
Hey, Toby.
Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it���s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
C���mon, c���mon.
[exclaims] Atherozar!
Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
I would remember.
Shunning resumed.
By hand.
You should ask her out.
Don't tell Michael...
Men find me desirable.
YEAH!
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
Wait, what Holly said?
You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?
It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.
Oui.
We will be called Gryffindor.
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?
Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
Hey, we nailed the sale!
Move to the side of the road!
I was born a man, Halpert.
Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
Nice.
Thank you.
All right then. Someone propose a plan.
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
I know that. Don't you think I know that?
Hey!
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
Don't.
Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
Oscar.
OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
Yeah...
But I'm right?
You.
[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
Gosh. He he.
He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.
Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
Let the bedbugs bite!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!
Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
Very well.
[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
Michael!?
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!
The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
No. You will not.
I���d love to be in the loop, David.
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Nice to see you. May I hold him?
He took my desk.
That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
My pants fell down! I don���t have a belt!
They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like���not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor���
You may have...
Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her.
No.
I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
Spoken like a true root man.
I'm not-- I'm not following you.
[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
No.
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
Five percent. No less.
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
This is war and that is what happens.
Okay, why are you calling Jo?
[chuckles]
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
No thanks I'm stuffed.
Office Depot!
Excellent.
When no one hedded--
You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
I got it here.
Okay, and remember-you're not gay.
Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.
Yes!
[turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
You want me to flush him?
We better.
Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]
My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.
It's gorgeous.  Let's go!
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They���ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ���em on in there.
Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes.
Hey... Why did you do it?
What?
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]
Two to three hours...
Getting defensive?
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
[scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
Unless we're unplugged.
Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
No, it's not.
That's how it's done.
I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]
Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.
I take full responsibility.
Amazons.
Oh we know.
Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.
Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan]
Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
Don't even care!
[grunts in frustration]
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ���ahhmmm��� excuse me��� What?! Not now, I'm busy.
Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don���t try planking. It���s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ���Specially with me around.
It is time to unveil the tree.
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
No.
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.
Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You���re still at the 570 number?
Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
Could be.
I���ll get my apprehension kit.
Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]
Okay. But it���s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can���t scrub worth a damn.
What are you doing?
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
Meet my eye line, Jim!
No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
Hey.
No! [arguing over each other]
It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.
You throat-rip.
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
I know. I know exactly what to do.
No you do not.
No, please don't do this, monkey.
Know what?
Well I will prove you wrong.
Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']
Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.
Who cares.
I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]
Hmmm?
It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
Hello, you're back.
He's searching out younger gays.
[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.
Do you have batteries?
I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
Mr. Peanut is not classy.
You'll be fine over there.
Hey, hey!
Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
No.
Uh huh.
We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Any brothers or sisters?
We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
[typing] Okay, let me finish this thought.
Crap.
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]
Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Was she talkin' back?
Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?
Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
Hey buddy, what are you up to?
A bazooka. You remembered.
Not��� significant is a big word���
I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.
Zip your lid!
Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: There���s a madman in our midst.
No, Kevin, come on.
It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him!
[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
You���re the Quizno���s. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn���t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
Okay.
Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
So I can lower it.
Shhh, Pam. C���mon, don���t be such a right-sider.
I thought you guys couldn���t come.
Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it 'Hay Place'. Eldred Called it 'Hay World'. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.
No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]
Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.
Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
It's not really 1992 anymore.
They're testing it now.
Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
[moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention]
One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]
You did not just say that! You don���t know Pam. She is really cool.
Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Two more.
[lifting box] Ugh! Ow.
He's not a songbird.
KGB.
Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
Because you're engaged to Andy.
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
(smirking) Exactly.
...before noon...
Shampoo.
None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?
Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.
Oh.
You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
Hey, this is none of your business.
No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.
���Gy-na��� said that?
The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
How do I apply?
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
From the downsizing.
Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!
Not like this.
Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?
It means like this. [snaps fingers]
[unimpressed] Really?
Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
So, you can tell your clients: ���Unleash the power of the pyramid.���
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
If you want.
Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
Thank you very much for that.
Good.
[pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty.
He says Thank you.
You work on commission, don't you?
[frightened] Uh!
What position did you use to conceive?
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
[to Erin] How are the marks?
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
Right.
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
Yaoo yay! [claps]
Eight?
No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders.
[on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?
Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
Shut up.
Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It���s called ���Schrute or Consequences.��� You���re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
Michael.
Hey, hey.
Oh really?
Who are you talking to?
Ah!
You need-
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it���s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
[alarm sounds] People!
Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won���t be necessary tonight.
[sighs] This is your job, Halpert.
How would you do that?
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!
[laughs hysterically] I got her!
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Wait, what girlfriend?
When is the guest of honor coming?
Oh he's not that nice.
Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face.
You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!
I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.
I most certainly did not.
Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
None of your business, Jim.
Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!
With my leads and stuff like that?
[hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Open the gates! There���s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There���s plenty for everyone!
I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
On three. One... two... three.
I can't. I can't push harder!
Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
No.
At what time?
Well, that didn't go well.
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet���.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]
The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
Yes!
No, that is huge.
Dunder-Mifflin.
Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
That is my idea.
Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk]
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible 'Jim faces']
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
[heated discussion in the 'Dwight Schrute Workspace', door opens] I did not dismiss you.
I have to have an emergency crown put in.
[quietly] Phyllis?
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he���s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
You have your lawyer there?
Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?
How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
No kidding.
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
You'll have Pam to answer to.
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
The city of Atlanta.
Hear anything interesting?
Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
Hey Pam.
It���s a youtube thing! Let���s go. Let���s go. Come on, they���re coming.
Okay, go ahead, they're right.
Okay.
Not! [scoffs]
Yes.
No.
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
You didn't have to...
500 and one penny.
Hey.
Wait, what?  You can't take what?
What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
Jim, you're the new schedule guy, huh?
Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he���s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
[whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
It could be kind of funny.
Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn���t on the itinerary.
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.
That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
What do you know?
Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
What? I believe it.
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
[again] Assistant Regional Manager.
Rhythm and blues...
No.
[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight]
Like this? Watch.
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
Really?
Oh, this could be a juicy one.
Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
Not good.
It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
I demand more questions!
I'm barren, Jim.
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
We'll see.
Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
I can���t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I���ll be launched into space. God, you���re so insensitive.
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind.
...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].
[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
That's exactly what I said.
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don���t lie. I can tell if you���re lying.
....back orders and you never called them.
You can be so modest sometimes.
We did it!
Frosting.
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
.. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]
What did they do to you, Angela?
Where's your tie?
Vegetarian?
Okay, I'll drive.
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
And 'Breaking Corporate News.'
A knife.
[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
How long before?
Which one's yours?
Maybe you've got mono.
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.
Merry Christmas. Good.
No, no, no, no...
Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
Do you live in a regular sized house?
[scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!
Have you collected the money from everyone?
Yes.
[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
I think you need to confess...
No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Listening.
Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
Okay scram, wizard.
Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.
I'll take that as a no.
Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.
[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
OK.
What is a scented candle?
[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
Eiffel Tower.
Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That's good. That's good.
Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!
Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
Stop it!
Yeah.
I'm on it.
Just doing my job.
Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]
Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.
Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?
[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
Hey, you wanted to see me?
That was the last signature I needed.
Got it. [Andy's hand goes up]
He totally misses,
It���s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
Like those?
Excuse me, I got a question for you.
How much longer is this going to take?
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.
Tape recorder.
Yes.
Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
You've got a ton of dandruff.
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
Let's go.
Never!
[picks up his beeping cell phone]
[to old man] Okay, you're done.
Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
Michael?
Uh-huh.
I can't... [starts running]
On your marks, get set...
Okay, hey, hey, hey...
Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
What is your weapon?
Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Yes.
So, you ever been convicted of a felony?
Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
What?
Pow! Pow! Pow!
Single... OK.
I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file]  'Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.' Juvie. 'According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor...'  Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]
Yes.
Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
No, try me.
Yes!
It was pretty awesome.
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
If I were you...
It's simpler this way.
[Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
[places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
I'll get someone to take it down.
[counts down in French]
You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian
Pam is down for anything.
Oh [half-heartedly throws something]
MIS... MI... What are you doing?
Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!
All we can do is sit and wait.
[smiles knowingly]
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I���m eating Jims.
Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
No!
You're lying.
Yes..?
Yeah.
[surprised] Ah!
Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
Uh, if they don't bobble, what's the point?
For what purpose?
It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
But the little cars go in the compact spot!
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
What is it? Who wrote it?
No! [waves arms] Pam, I'm over here!
