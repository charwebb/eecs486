Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
[Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans]
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
[Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.
Cause I could look it up real easily.
He doesn't even know that I do that.
No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]
Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
[singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]
Maybe over a beer after she���s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
I can get you exotic meats ��� hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
I have to have an emergency crown put in.
When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
You���re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we���ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
For five years I���ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it���s time for me to just let that thought go. It���s kind of painful, but it���s also freeing in a way. Now it���s all about my instincts.
I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
[turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?
Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.
This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
I know. I could just bang you right now.
Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
Prestige is ours. Okay, they���re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
Maybe you do. Hi. I���m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It���s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes.
One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.
You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
I can���t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh��� No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
Well something's come up, I have to go.
Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That���s right. You���re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He���s gonna be moving slowly. It���s only���
...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].
Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That's good. That's good.
[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.
Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ��� What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'
Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley���s got way more body fat than they do.
Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
From when he recommended me to replace him.
Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put
No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
Don���t be an idiot. It���s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you���ve been here. That���s the max.
Hey, how's it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
[singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]
You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ���ahhmmm��� excuse me��� What?! Not now, I'm busy.
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...
The eyes are the groin of the head.
I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
It���s a colloquial way of saying ���you���re fired,��� Kevin, which you are.
Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]
Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it 'Hay Place'. Eldred Called it 'Hay World'. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.
[as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They���re extraordinary.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
We did it, we did it. I love you.
Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?
I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.
It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
Okay, listen. I���m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I���ve never actually done this before.
Here���s how I���m going to help out from now on. I���m going to not care, and I���m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy���s inevitable demise.
Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]
Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]
Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
That���s right. Will you just give us a second?
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
Smasher? No, where���d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city���s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
[whispering] I don���t know. I just don���t know.
Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger���s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].
Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
I don't get that, I don't understand that.
You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
This conversation has two items on the agenda.
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor]
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]
[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]
David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.
Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]
Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Now, for the last time, I���d like a side salad with balsamic.
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp.
[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
[stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.
That���s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
No, don���t say it. You���re fired! You���re both fired!
I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
I'm about to buy this building, you know.
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.
[scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
I know how we can learn his tricks.
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.
Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but���
There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I'll install it on your computer.
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
Well, I���ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
[Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
[moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention]
Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could���ve met in the lobby. It���s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
I don���t like him either. ��And yet I really like him.
Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?
Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They���ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ���em on in there.
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
That���s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don���t vibrate at all.
Listen to me! I love you! And I don���t care that Phillip���s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We���re running late. Let���s get him inside.
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!
Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
You were making me do things that were not all right.
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
We all have a hero in our heart.
Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
This is not a test! Move to the exits!
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he���s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that���s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]
Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
No, but we should discuss that another time.
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
That's exactly the point.  You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know-
[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...
Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.
[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
No. Putting a load on more like it.
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
Paranoid? I���m not familiar with the word. And I really don���t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
I already made an appointment��� with your secretary.
