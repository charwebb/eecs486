There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
[waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael's office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this?  Jan?
Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? [Pretends to be on phone] ���Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.��� It's that easy.
In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and���
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.
So what I���m hearing you say is, ���Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible���?
I have to have an emergency crown put in.
25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other���s minds. You���re trying to give your wife this job.
Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
No. I���ll be damned if I���m gonna let us lose me.
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]
[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door]
But the little cars go in the compact spot
Thank you. I���m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?
There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
[reading the note with the gay-dar]  'Hope this helps.  -Jim'  Nice!
As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
[Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.
Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]
Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]
It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
[golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat]
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]
Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: There���s a madman in our midst.
It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ���Scranton Mimeograph Corp?��� I don���t think we���re doing business with them any time soon. That���s odd. ��A letter from Robert Dunder. ���A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.��� The Holy Grail.
[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.
[walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim's pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim's voice] 'We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our...' [pauses recording] I've got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  I'm not insane. [starts the recording again] '...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.'
Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]
She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
That's exactly the point.  You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know-
No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
That���s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don���t vibrate at all.
Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
[running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.
It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
[looks over and sees hole in his present]  Crap.  [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up]  Come here you.
You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.
No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that.
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.
Who was the second man on the moon?
Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]
Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?
Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]
However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
I know that. Don't you think I know that?
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you���re so smart. You���re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
Listen to me! I love you! And I don���t care that Phillip���s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]
Come up with a statement in the next hour....
And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won���t be necessary tonight.
Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
Clark has no chance. I mean, he���s up against my buddy Rolf, for God���s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ��� he���ll make you laugh so hard, you���ll puke your pants.
Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That's good. That's good.
[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
The buyer is your sister���s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that���s an order.
Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]
Well, we���re both just kinda learning as we go, aren���t we?
No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.
I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.
I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]
Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?
Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I���m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.
And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
It was nothing personal. It���s just that you were terrible at your job.
[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
There���s plenty. Don���t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
[handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
[picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.
Andy I���m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]
Stanley! Wake up! You���ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.
Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh���should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.
I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]
[hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]
Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ���I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt��� unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?
Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.
That is a damnable lie. I love women.
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.
[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone]
Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist]
Daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare���s milk?
[Reading from computer] ���Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!��� That means you can't make me do squat.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.
Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.
Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
[voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
Then I would bring an axe, no books.
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
[Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans]
[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.
I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that���s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]
I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.
People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.
And you want me to come with you.
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.
Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet]
He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
Come on, let���s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis]   You want half a sandwich?
[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It���s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]
I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
Smasher? No, where���d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city���s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
How long has he been in the bathroom?
Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
So I���ve got your resume here, but it���s not telling me everything.
[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here���s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
It���s a youtube thing! Let���s go. Let���s go. Come on, they���re coming.
[heated discussion in the 'Dwight Schrute Workspace', door opens] I did not dismiss you.
No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I'll install it on your computer.
Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.
...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
[Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
You know where it is. Lead me there.
You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
[scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.
I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure.
Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound]
All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.
Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]
[bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
I can tell. I won't let you down.
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.
I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
