So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
Nice.
Get...
You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
No thanks I'm stuffed.
Gimli.
[turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
Stanley, could you come with me, please.
Great. Get the plate number.
So you're taking a personal day?
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
No, I wanna seduce her.
What?
[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
Three...
Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]
[looking up at Creed] Dad?
The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]
I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
[scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
No.
I don't believe you. Continue.
Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
[whispering] Michael.
[raises hand] Here.
Sometimes it hurts Michael.
[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
Right, that's good, good, pursue this.
It doesn't make any sense.
I thought he was out on the road.
My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
I can't do this.
Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]
Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
Nash.
The buyer is your sister���s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that���s an order.
Inbwit? Yes.
No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]
She had a hysterectomy.
I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
Pull over!
Go, get up there right now.
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Accept it, why would he come back?
That's bad.
Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
It is so on!
All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
Oh.
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check��� on that later today. This is my grandmother���s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother���s buttock bullet ring.
It was rotting.
You are the future!
[typing] Okay, let me finish this thought.
Oh my goodness.
Okay, I���m gonna need you to print it out.
Good luck, Michael.
[scoffs] Vaccines are for chumps!
Yes, you do.
Now. Now. Now.
But this isn���t interim manager. No. It���s Dwight K. Schrute��� [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
Why would Michael give you one before me?
Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
Yeah Jim.
Maybe you've got mono.
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Her name?
OK!
Pam, are you all right?
Cell phone?  Charger?
Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ���em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
I don't know.
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
Your own paper company.
[in Jim's office]  Sign this.
Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
I can see that as a very real possibility.
I got a splinter.
This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
I'm just saying...
The temp.
[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
PETA.
Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
What do you know?
Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
[sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.'
Every day is black tie optional!
That is impossible.  Unless you mean gonorrhea.
Let's go!
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
Michael is gone.
[picks up his beeping cell phone]
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
Yes.
It's going very well.
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
That's not going to happen.
...for people's behavior.
Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
[confused] No.
Listen up.  Let's start... from the ground
Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
[tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo!
Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
I know that's what he said.
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
Zip your lid!
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet���.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]
Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?
Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
Mm-hmm. Good safe?
Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
It happens occasionally.
You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
Birthday hug!
I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's...
[scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
Fire Jim.
Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
Yes!
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager���s job?
Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.
Yeah.
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
Please?
Woohoo! Yes!
Jim. Look I���m eating you.
Sniffling how?
You're welcome.
As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]
Where?
Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
No, everything's fine.
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
[sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back!
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
Where are we going?
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Seven? Can I finish please?
Aah! Actually, he���s right in front of us.
Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV.'
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Thank you. I���m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]
[off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?
[talking over Michael] God, what a steal.
What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.
Where is Ryan?
Yes, Sensei!
It's not effeminate. It's festive.
Okay, listen. I���m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I���ve never actually done this before.
Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?
You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
You didn't poison me, it's just stress.
[while everyone is gathered playing and singing ���Sons & Daughters���] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
What's our presentation about?
Let's table that. So, temp... You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar.
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
[opens eyes wide in total surprise]
How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]
It's a divet...
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
[on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?
They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
Who is the king of Prussia?
Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
Come on, shooter!
[looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one.
Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.
What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late.
It���s a root you idiot.
Thank you Michael.
Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
[re-entering the store] I'll take the wizard!
I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
You believe a computer can beat me?
Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
That is my stapler.
I'll try and think of one. When...
Right. Okay? Great.
[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not?
[whispers to Clark] We don���t get along.
Really?
Hey... what are you guys doing?
What? Ooh!
We better.
Listen to me! I love you! And I don���t care that Phillip���s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
He was dead the whole time.
You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I���ll do mine���.. walnuts?
[Jo leaves] I, uh...
How do you know it's going to be a boy?
[long pause] Crentist.
You think I don���t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I���ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne���er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don���t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Uh, better ask Jim.
Loser.
We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]
Let me get that door for you--  [runs to open door]
Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you���re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
Yes. Fast food. I���ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
Hello.
First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'  Those are the money beets.
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
Doesn't matter.  I'll escort you!
Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!
We?'
[grunting, shouting]
What?
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
It's just for family.
[shouts from another room] What did you do?
Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
Dale Raymond Corson!
Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
Hey, he can handle it.
Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
Thank you.
Die. You just... You said it.
So sexy it becomes hostile.
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
Yeah, and we���re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
I hadn't noticed.
I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!
[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
I can get you exotic meats ��� hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
I'm losing control of my bladder.
Andy.
What's that?
A loyal, but bungling apostle.
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
May I please speak to your boss?
I can try. I���m gonna use SMS text.
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
I was wondering-
[lifts cup up with toes]
Your path from obesity begins right here!
Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Yaoo yay! [claps]
If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.
Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?
No.
Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.
I know.
There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't...
Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
What would you have done? Been manager?
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.
I won't.
What-
Who is the king of England?
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
Hear anything interesting?
No, like you.
What?
Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
Ryan.
And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
I was aware that you were speaking.
Hey, Jan.
You said you didn't know how to say it.
You never know. Better safe than sorry.
Yes.
Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
Okay, this isn���t working for me, ���cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
Alright, move it.
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
[Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.
I don't think so, no.
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
Yeah!
Will never be her name.
Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
Yes. Yes.
Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
[scoffs] The boss isn't funny.
Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession?
[plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
Pam.
No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand]
Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
Excuse me sir.
Okay. Come on! Jim!
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Been there, done that.
Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.
Oh my God.
Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound]
That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
.. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.
So don't.
Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
I know. You���re gonna be okay, Monkey.
How could it be more clear?
All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
This is not at drill!
Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief]
They fall under the category of airplanes.
It���s just one thing. Just let me���let me do this���
Yeah.
There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]
I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
Fine.
Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
Good! Okay. Flirt away.
Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You'll be back.
Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
I'm on official business.
Thanks for meeting me.
[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
You've got to tell Andy about us.
Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
Awesome.
Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?
We gotta see what he's got.
Which is?
No, no. No spoilers. Please.
[taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!
I can save the branch.
Also, it's icky back there.
What if he's a murderer?
Hey, you're making me spray!
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
I���ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I���m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Michael.
Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
Wait, shut up.
Blah.
Do you love me or not?
Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
Okay.
No, I didn't.
I'm only going to ask you this once. Are you part of an alliance?
On your marks, get set...
Then I would bring an axe, no books.
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
You dressed exactly like the servants.
Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.
Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.
It was pretty awesome.
That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
Let's get the party started.
The White Pages.
Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]
Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I'll install it on your computer.
I���d like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]
Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?
Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
If I were you...
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I���ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?
What is this?
I do, I have to go.
[sobbing] Thank you.
Burgers.
400 and one penny.
Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
Three.
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Oh, no, no. It's on the Miata.
What can I do better?
Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley���s got way more body fat than they do.
Anything else would be inconsistent.
This interview is over. I'll let you know.
[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.
I'm about to buy this building, you know.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I���m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
Cow, goat or sheep.
Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.
What were your favorite moments?
What���s a book? [giggles]
Crowd control, directing traffic...
Very close.
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
It's called a costume.
[taking pen back] Gimme that.
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
Psssh, no.
I don't know.
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
Deceit does not come easy to me.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
In. I'm hungry.
[On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
I���d have to get some more wire and string, but it���s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Absolutely not.
What a courageous venture.
Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
...because you are never going to see him again.
Lunch.
Can you breathe?
[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
She loves me.
What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
Hey.
It means they are not expanding.
There���s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
Hello.
Ho, thirty years.
Visual aids.
I do.
You liked it!
We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
Yes.
...with you. [chuckles]
Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
Woo!
That snake!
I insist.
Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
And I���ve never seen you go to work, ever.
Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
What is it?
Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?
I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.
You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
Are you sure that's going to work?
You know what? You���re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you���re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
Thank God.
I'm... discombobulated.
Weird.
What belt are they?
He's searching out younger gays.
Please.
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?
Get in.
Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I���m eating Jims.
It'll all be goat.
Next suggestion.
No.
I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file]  'Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.' Juvie. 'According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor...'  Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]
[grunts] Okay, we���re good. We���re good. Let���s go. Push!
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
Wow.
Congratulations.
Try 'Big Boobs' with a 'Z'.
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Aaaaaaaa!
[winks] I'm on it. [leaves room]
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
Damn you.
Very well, we will come back at 5:15.
Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
Yes.
Oh, great. He���s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
[scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.
He doesn't even want to go.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
Yes. Anything.
Don���t worry, it���s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It���s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
[scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet]
You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.' You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
Oh, good, and you resent this because...
I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
Do you know where we are, temp?
[voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous.
[cries harder] Thank you, Michael.
Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
Do you
[picks up pencil between his toes]
There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it���s your call.
So we know which truck to van...
That���s it.
You don���t need to repeat right now, when I���m saying it.
Where we going?
No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
Thank you.
Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]
Before I go, may I?
No, my groin...
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
Yes!
Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
No. Phyllis, you're not...
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door]
Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]
Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
Come along, afterthought.
No.
Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
Yes!
I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.
[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here���s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
Dwight...
Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']
[walking up] Michael?
He took my desk.
I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?
Well something's come up, I have to go.
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
All right.
Hey. Come on, buddy. Let���s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don���t compare. When you���re with the R-O-L-F, you���re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
What? No way!
Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You���re still at the 570 number?
We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
We'll see.
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
Power.
...before noon...
I already made an appointment��� with your secretary.
Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
Anyone else?
Pam, would you care for a bagel?
Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager���s office before?
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
Ahhh.  Mweehaa
Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
I was right.
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
Try influenza.
No.
Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam's shoulders] You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
[laughs hysterically] I got her!
Mmmnnnnmmm...
No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead.
As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
Have you collected the money from everyone?
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.
Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
[on the phone] ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber.
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
Where?
Not what I asked.
Creed! Come on. Stanley!
Sorry.
I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.  [bites into the sandwich half, chews]  Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat.
Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?
Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus?
Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!
You.
[tests smoke detector] Good.
[boastfully] Yes.
Jan, have you ever had deer?
This is not a test! Can you leave?!
Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]
Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!
There is no way that hurt.
Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
Have you seen Erin?
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
Actually��� You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I���ll take one too.
Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
Okay, go ahead, they're right.
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
No, don���t say it. You���re fired! You���re both fired!
You wanted to see me?
I will trade you for the used candle.
What? This is such bullcrap!
Ah, I'm not interested.
[handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
No, Kevin, come on.
Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
Not Dwight.
You���re really going to want the booster.
[laughs] No!
My eyes!
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
I don't want people making fun of my nose.
What?
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
Well...
Thank you.
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and���
That���s great. Let���s do this guys.
Pam, information is power.
[at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side.
Eel fishing.
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
Thank you, Angela.
Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...
Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo!
I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
[shakes fist, whispers] Yeah!
I might see a movie.
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Little of this, little of that.
Motel 6? Best Western?
Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring.
Final touch-ups.
I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
No thank you.
He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
I can't see.
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Michael.
Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
Either he goes, or I go.
You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?
I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
[putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
What did you say?
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I���ve ever made.
No. She needs her rest again.
Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
What are you doing?
