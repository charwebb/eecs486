Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]
Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.
Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?
[hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.
You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It���s gonna be fine. It���s gonna be fine. There���s plenty of Pyramids.
I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
This is exciting! You���re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, ���perfect pork anus��� which I don't mean.
Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
You took something that doesn't belong to you.
Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he���s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
The bride and groom? What are their names?
It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face]
This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don���t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
Nice to see you. May I hold him?
Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]
Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.
Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He���s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I���m hesitant. Why can���t I pull the trigger on any of them?
[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.
Can I get you a tankard of mead?
Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]
Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
I can���t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I���ll be launched into space. God, you���re so insensitive.
Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
[Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans]
That's exactly the point.  You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know-
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
It was his birthday, just turned three. So���
What lab did these little clones escape from?
Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I���m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there���s a mini-reunion. A kind of a ���where are they now��� panel at a local theatre. It���ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven���t seen Kevin since we let him go.
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
Bet you I got mine for less than yours.
Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
They are either going to say yes... or no.
Is that how they like to get in?
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.
[laughs while spray painting ���Jim is Awesome��� on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
Oh my God, we have to be there.
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].
And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
He���s like a manatee. Ready? Let���s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley���s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.�� No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.'
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
[scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]
Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
I have to put you on with my boss.
Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go!
It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
I will. I will. You need to calm down.
I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I���m finished, it���s over.
What for? We haven���t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren���t deep fried, right?
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
How do you know it's going to be a boy?
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
No, you���ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list]
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.
I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
[scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.
Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
Don���t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]
[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.
Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
You did this for me? [camera pans to 'Welcome Back Oscar' sign]
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]
Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?
... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
Is that the last year the data was available?
All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]
No no no, I can't let you do this!
You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]
It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
So what I���m hearing you say is, ���Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible���?
New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let���s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let���s go.
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
[punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]
No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
I���m sorry. I���ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the?
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
Jim���wha��� Come on! What���what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
You won���t stop until you���ve poached us all.
Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.
Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]
So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.
Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that���s what working at a paper company���s all about!
[tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor���s had stolen from him?
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]
I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.
At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes.  Also.
You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]
All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
Come on, let���s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
I know how we can learn his tricks.
Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?
Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]
[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.
[On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
[Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
How dare you all attack him like this.
Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.
It���s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]
[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?
Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind.
[fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they���re not even good. Really, they���re bad. Like you and your son.
Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
This is not a test! Move to the exits!
Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don���t know where I���d put you.
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
With today���s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it���s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
[on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.
This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
Okay, I���m gonna need you to print it out.
Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!
[walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim's pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim's voice] 'We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our...' [pauses recording] I've got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  I'm not insane. [starts the recording again] '...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.'
Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
It���s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I���d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.
It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.
You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don���t lie. I can tell if you���re lying.
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
Andy I���m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.
Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
You know what? You���re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you���re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again]
Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What���s going on Nellie? Talk to me.
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?
Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
.. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]
A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]
[looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this.
[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!
Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.
Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.
Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
