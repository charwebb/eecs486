I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?
Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you?
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.
Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.
