Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.
You gonna be home later?
(from outside Monk's) Take It Off!
You should.
I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.
Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.
Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You!
Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder)
Twice? I wanna go twice.
