"I know!" he said with a new happy grin,
"I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"
Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour. 
Canadians in attendance cannot believe their eyes. Widespread panic.  The princess being... hoisted away. The little mushroom people of Nova Scotia, screaming with horror.  The prince is attempting to grab hold of the cube. The duke and the duchess of Calgary hiding behind the pews. This is indeed a horrible day for all of Canada, and therefore- and the pudding has just been knocked over! Oh, this does not go with tradition at all! The royal pudding now spilling all over the abbey as the princess is lifted up, up... And she's gone. The princess has been taken. This is indeed a horrible day for Canada, and therefore, the rest of the world. 
When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard,
And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!
Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo. 
The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill.
Then he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!
The little critters worked hard as they happily sang,
And each one of them had a quite interesting name.
There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear.
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer.
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.
Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets.  These alien beings visited our world, and once, even settled it, from deep within the galaxy Canis Major, and a distant planet called... Plymouth. 
Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form?  What exactly did the Pilgrims experience?  How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November? 
And back home, there were presents, and lots of food to get fat.
And it was the best Christmas ever for the boy in the red poofball hat.
He knew that only by going to the forest could he --
She still got some afterbirth to push out of her. 
And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.
After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter.  In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven.  From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express.  Four friends, turn apart by tragedy , would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents.  And the boys received treatment for their herpes.
