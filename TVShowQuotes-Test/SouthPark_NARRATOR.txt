They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada.  But a fast-paced rocket ride to success would bring them to the depths of despair.  This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow.

The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...

After years of depression and suicide attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally decided to get together  for one last film:  the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer.  And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 , in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was considered a great success.  After almost being executed by the American government , Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada , where they were touted as heroes.  They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through.  And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow. 

Killing a mountain lion was no easy task,
But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast.

The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave? 

The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun. 

Terrance was born Terrance Henry Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto.  At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies.  It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle , a brash young baby from Montreal.  Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere.  At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show . where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time.

"I know!" he said with a new happy grin,
"I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"

As they entered their late teens, Terrance and Phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success.  But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues.  The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip.  Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were on the cover of every magazine.  And then in 1998, even a Saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip.  Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices.

Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends...

But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. 

"Of course I'll build you a little manger!" the little boy cried,
and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!
