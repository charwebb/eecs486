Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends...

A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?

The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun. 

"Where can they learn that?" the boy said with a frown.
"I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town."

Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo. 

Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining.  His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman,  he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math.

It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings.

Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, "Dude, fuck you!"

Pabst Blue Ribbon and white trash. It's a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home.  This white trash home in Colorado seems innocent enough. 

Yes, he did.

Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.

And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.

Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say "yes."

We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens! 

The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave?
