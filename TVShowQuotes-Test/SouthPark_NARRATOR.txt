Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends League...

And now the scraping off of the pudding.

Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, "Dude, fuck you!"

"I know!" he said with a new happy grin,
"I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"

The boys have just made a sobering discovery.  For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down.  The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family.  But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour.

Meanwhile, at the White House...

She still got some afterbirth to push out of her. 

Canadian prince now dipping his arms into the pudding.  As is tradition.  Princess will of course scrape the pudding off the prince's arms, thus symbolizing their union. What a glorious day for our country and indeed the world. And now of course the- wait a minute. What's this? Oh. Uh oh. Something is going terribly wrong. The abbey is shaking violently	as explosions abound. The top- Yes, the top of the abbey is collapsing. The prince and the princess look on in horror. This is not the tradition. This is not tradition at all. A giant hole now blasted into the ceiling, debris falling down and crushing several spectators, which is also not the tradition for a royal Canadian wedding.  Bright beam of light shooting through the hole in the ceiling.  The princess now in some kind of... isometric cube.  This is certainly breaking with tradition now.

Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo. 

Terrance was born Terrance Henry Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto.  At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies.  It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle , a brash young baby from Montreal.  Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere.  At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show . where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time.

Yes, he did.

Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends...

It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle.

Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. 

So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.
And took them to where abortions are performed.
