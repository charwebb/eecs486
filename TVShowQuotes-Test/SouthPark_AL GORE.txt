Thank you, class. Excelsior! 

Groan! Groan! 

No! ManBearPig has to die! 

I'm so glad I don't have your job. 

I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker.   I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the "real" ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?
