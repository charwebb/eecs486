Hi kids! Come on in!  Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?
Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!
We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more.
