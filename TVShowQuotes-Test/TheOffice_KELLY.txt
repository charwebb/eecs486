Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything.  I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
