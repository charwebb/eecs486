I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
Wait, not Roy.  Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
