Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ���How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.���
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month.....
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
[opens 'New Moon' poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him]
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
