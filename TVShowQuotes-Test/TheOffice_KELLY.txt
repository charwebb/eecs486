Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
I don't know.
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
I don't get the reason for this party.
Yeah bitch.
Never marrying.
God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
Oh God. [takes off ring]
Well that blows.
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
Yeah, well, that���s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
Umm, see you later tonight.
You chose this job over that job?
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
Oh, art show!
Mmm hmm.
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
Ignore her, those glasses are so cool.
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
Can we speak privately about our relationship?
But I--it's not right.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
I look
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
It's a small office.
I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
Hi-yah!
Is that a blow torch?!
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
Here's the deal.  I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
What emails are you talking about?
Pam, he's just not that into you.
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
Look, I'm gonna count to 3.
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
Not so much anymore.
Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
Oh yeah? Screw you too.
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
He's not saying anything!
We're back together again baby.
Ryan.
Try 'Jesus.'
You told us we had to.
Yes, I told everyone.
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
[mouth full of cake] Me too!
Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
Ahhh! What's going on?!?!
Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
Yo.
I didn't do anything!
Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
You did? I wanna see the cake.
What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason?
Bye. [Andy barks]
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Pam.  She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
Hi, Michael.
Do you think I'm a slut?
...that I thought you should know ...
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
Cool.
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
Enjoy the snow losers.
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
Are you going to happy hour later?
A lot. Black guys mostly.
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
