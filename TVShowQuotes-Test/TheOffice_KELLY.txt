The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
Having fun.
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
Guess whose boyfriend it is?
Screw you.
Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
Never marrying.
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
What happened? Is there a ring?
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
I love it.
Have we met before?
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
[cries, slams fist on desk] Why?
On it.
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
Yeah, where are your kids?
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
[laughing] I love you too.
I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint.  If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.
Oh my God.  He's going to kill us.
What'd you say h[bleep]?
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
Should I seduce him?
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
[bleep] me!
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
I do, I do. This isn't right.
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?
Yeah.
No, seriously Pam, wake up.
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
So, I was looking so hot...
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
Rachel.
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
Tu Bishvat!
Okay. [makes out with Darryl]
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
Why is that?
What?
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
Thank you.
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Now he's never gonna come.
That looks, cool, where is that?
I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
Mmhmm.
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
Oh, my God. You scared me.
Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
That's not that bad actually.
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'
Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
Look, I'm gonna count to 3.
Just put it in your pocket.
That was really cool. [they make out]
