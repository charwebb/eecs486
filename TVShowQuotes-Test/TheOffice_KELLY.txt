Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
I don't want to hit the big rock!
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]
Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
Can we just take those first two things?
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
