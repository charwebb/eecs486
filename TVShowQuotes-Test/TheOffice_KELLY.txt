You had carbs?  That's awful.
Dwight: What are you doing?
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
...what else do people like?
Oh yeah? Screw you too.
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
She could be.
Look, I'm gonna count to 3.
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Good.
Well, I think I'd look really hot in one.  Where'd you get your fedora?
[shaking head] Weird.
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Namaste.
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
Finn.
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Oh, God, please stop!
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
A lot. Black guys mostly.
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
What the hell is a mallard?
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
What keeps your glasses on?
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It's from Mexico.
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
You always say that, and I almost never know.
I hear whispering.
You prayed for this?
I never know when you're kidding.
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
Me, too Oscar.
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
Definitely, definitely, Jim.
This point system is really insulting.
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
[Screams]
Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
That was really cool. [they make out]
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
[mumbles]
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
When Deangelo's around.
Ryan, we're doing the dance!
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
Yeah.
Well help me, OK? Just, uh take...
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
What drama?
Looks like salmon.
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
Can we just take those first two things?
Rachel.
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
You are so mean.
Can I have a turkey burger?
Isn't that like your third soda today?
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
Well that blows.
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Good. And the dry cleaners?
I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
What?
Josh Duhamel.
