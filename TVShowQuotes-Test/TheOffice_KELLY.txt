If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
Will someone please explain what���s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it���s like my life is buffering.
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'
Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
[sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
[to Jim] I'm serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big?  So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that.  So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking?  What kind of game is that?
Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
