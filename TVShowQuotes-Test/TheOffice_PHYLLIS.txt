Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
You left me in a bad part of town!
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
