No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
What do we do? How do we stop this?
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
