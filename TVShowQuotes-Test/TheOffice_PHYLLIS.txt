Cold, huh?
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
It's fish.
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
Hillary Swank.
No, it's 4:35.
Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
She does have very nice clothes.
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
I thought it was...
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
I think he-
It's just me here.
Michael... No.
Dwight said it's 'Hog maw.'
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
Hey.
Cool.
How much wine do you have?
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Call a doctor.
Afghani.
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
Ooh.
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
Wait, what?
What does the furnace do?
And napkins... fanned.
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
You guys are together?
What are you wearing?
How do you know it's a gun?
Wait, they have food there?
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
Please Michael.
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
Oh, I'll just duck my head in.
It's the lining of the stomach of--
I hope he's ok, I feel bad.
Dwight, get out of here!!
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
I say no.
They make you feel lighter...
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
Mistake.
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
Four.
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
I said no.
Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
It looks pretty black.
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
I'll talk to her, Michael.
Yeah, I lost my client.
Ahhh! [falls out of chair]
[laughs] Yeah.
You got dumped?
[whispering] It's about Michael.
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
No Bob, we worked it out.
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
Go get him Bobby!
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
Oh, we're in a meeting.
Well, there is a ball.
Don���t you have any sunblock?
Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that���s-.
It's labeled.
Michael, what will you do?
Sugarplum fairy wands.
Put it down
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
He needs to rest.
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
Hey, where���s my ring?
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
That's despicable.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
[whispering to Angela] I don't like you.
Can I get a list of your vendors?
Now this is getting ridiculous.
OK. Packer can go to hell.
I'll do it.
Hey, this is your apology letter.
I have an ace.
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
[moans in pain]
My mom taught me that.
Holy crap.
