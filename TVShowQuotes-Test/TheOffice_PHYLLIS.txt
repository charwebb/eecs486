Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
...report you to HR.
I'm sitting right here Dwight.
[grabbing the coffee] Hot!
We started selling balloons.
It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
We're in the same High School class.
I do.
No, she is the boss.
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
Know what?
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
Do you have a pole?
You're welcome.
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
Ryan, hand the phone over.
No, the one before that.
Go get him Bobby!
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
What are you gonna do?
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Mmm, no Bob, I don't know.
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
I like her purple dress.
Hello.
On purpose.
He's always been terrible with money.
I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
Holy crap.
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
Was there a fistfight?
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
I don't get it.
Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
Split the commission?
I thought maybe DJ's.
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
What did we write?
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
Oh, this isn't good.
Sic him!
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
Let's do it!
I know
When I was a little girl...
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
Bye everyone.
No, it's lettuce.
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
Can I get a list of your vendors?
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Ahhh! [falls out of chair]
Yeah?
Dwight...
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
I'm sorry, everybody.
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
The only Santa.
No.
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
[leaving the room] Excuse me.
I... twisted it.
Hello Angela.
So is it an open relationship?
Completely.
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
What?
Poor, poor Andy.
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
And this brings us to you, little one.
Yeah.
The girls school?
I knitted it for you.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
Oh, Michael.
Play it again.
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
