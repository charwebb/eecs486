Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
