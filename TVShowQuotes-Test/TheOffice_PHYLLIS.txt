I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
We think you made a big, big mistake.
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
