We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
