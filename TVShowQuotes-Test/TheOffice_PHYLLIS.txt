How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
[laughs] Yeah.
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
I have ears, Dwight.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
You know your perfumes!
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
There's nothing to know, it's just gossip.
Oh! [Michael laughs]
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
Bestiality. Yeah.
[whispers] I'm clicking!
I'm telling Michael.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
What are these for?
Helpless.
I didn't really get a good look.
Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
Michael?
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
OK.
Dwight, get out of here!
Thanks.
We have a right to know.
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
Keep me out of it.
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
It's my back.
Michael, what will you do?
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
Michael, I was doing so well.
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
What are you -
Me.
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
Yes, it's marijuana.
Sic him!
How about pepperoni?
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
Hi guys.
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
It's unbelievable!
I have an ace.
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
All right.
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
The girls school?
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
No.
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
Ooh.
Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles]
That's still a lot of money!
Yes.
I have a sports bra.
Okay.
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
She's not hot.
Are you sure? Yeah, it's locked.
If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Yeah, it's just a picnic.
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
When I was a little girl...
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
I knitted it for you.
Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
Yeah, it can���t be nothing.
Why would you do that?
It looks pretty black.
Eleven, wow!
I'm bringing someone.
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
Unbelievable.
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
That wasn't me.
What's wrong with you?
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
This is weird.
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Lose the twirl.
Yes you were.
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
No, she is the boss.
Yeah...
I think it's good.
Okay that's enough.
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
Well, I guess that's not-
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
[laughing] Thought we were playing for fun.
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
