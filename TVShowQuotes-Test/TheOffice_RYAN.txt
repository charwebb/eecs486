That we're having any problem at all.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
What's the halal option?
Well it is business, but not as usual.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
Stop that! Stop that!
Just started.
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
Hey, is Katy coming?
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
Robert, you are too kind.
Ok, to what?
Keep going. [Whispers]
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
Living in the moment.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
What?
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
To madness.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
...It doesn't apply.
Right.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
Okay...
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
You.  Us.
Yeah.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
[kisses for a little longer]  What's up?
Okay, I'm turning it off.
To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
No.
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything.
OK...
And?
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
Okay.
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
It's from '99.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
You are very welcome.
No! I will... go.
Who was that?
Depression?
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
You sure?
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Smokey's dead.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Nice.
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
Yeah.
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
No no no.
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Hey.
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
Is that your Cousin Mose?
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
That's really funny.
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
Darryl Rogers?
What about a long sleeve T?
Did this happen on company property?
With vodka, you're the best.
Thank you.
Good work, buddy.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
Ryan Howard.
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
Yeah?
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
What?
I can't- I can't not touch it.
Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
You're my friend, Michael.  OK?
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
Hello?
Yeah.
I-
All of a sudden?
How about rainbows?
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
He's rubbing his neck.
Yes.
I don't think you know what you're saying.
Guys, one second. [on dance videogame]
Things have been generally good.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
-and you jump in front of them.
I never went to Thailand.
Sixty thousand dollars a year.
You know what?
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
That's... great, I... that's awesome.
For Kelly?
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
Okay... uh, sorry?
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
No.
We did it !
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
Actually, it was.
