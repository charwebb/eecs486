No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
Yeah, punch him.
It's an investment.
Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
Michael? Are you done yet?
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
Kelly, you���re here.
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
Hey.
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
Stop. Stop it Andy.
Exactly.
Wear something nice.
Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
Will do.
What size shoes are you guys?
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
Sometimes he brings more costumes.
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
I can't- I can't not touch it.
We can't do this Dwight.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
Yeah!
Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
And he's really into penguins or something?
Look on the windshield.'
This guy owns his own beet farm.
Why would I lie about a performance review?
Go make a copy, secretary.
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
Thank you, Erin. Woof!
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
I don't want ketchup.
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
[Under his breath] Still.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
Yeah.  Maybe.
Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
I am.
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
They have business classes there?
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Hey.
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
Wow, um... Sorry you had to...
No.
Did this happen on company property?
Oh, no, I didn't know.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
The Washington University Public Health Fund.
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
Are you holding this chair?
I am not giving you my keys.
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
Huh? [puts on jacket]
I did not see Rango.
I am so sorry.
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
Dwight.
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
Chiklis style.
What's, uh, going on here?
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
Hey, I'm WUPHF.
I want an outsider.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
Okay...
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Yes!
They really didn't like me.
Will you roll those dice with me?
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Not really.
No, not yet.
How's it going?  Good day?
Do you mean Neverland?
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
I'd die for you too.
I'm already in business school.
Yeah.
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
Probably, yes.
No, it's whomever.
I would love to.
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
Yeah me too.
Same with coffee, and women.
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
That's... great, I... that's awesome.
Can I see it?
Bitttch!
...It doesn't apply.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
I'd be satisfied with eight.
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
Thank you.
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
[to Kevin] You scared me.
Hello.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Yeah.
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
In you go.
I don't do that stuff anymore.
