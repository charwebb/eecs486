[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
I don't think you know what you're saying.
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
