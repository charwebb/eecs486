Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
Why would I lie about a performance review?
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
