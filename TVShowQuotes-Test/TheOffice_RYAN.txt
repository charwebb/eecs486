I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
You wanted to have sex in my office.
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
