Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
And you know that I���m capable of this.
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
