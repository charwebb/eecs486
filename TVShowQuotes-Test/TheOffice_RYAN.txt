Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
Why are you being so weird about this?
This is not funny, man, let me down.
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
