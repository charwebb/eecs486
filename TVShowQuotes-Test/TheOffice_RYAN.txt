Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
At least we're outside.
No, not yet.
Yeah, I liked them too.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
No, you don't...
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Thanks.
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
Definitely.
What?
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
Yeah.
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
I think.
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
Don't you mean constructive criticism?
Yeah!
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
Kay.
Uh huh.
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Did you see Saw?
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
Are you happy you did?
Hi.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
Yeah, if you don't mind.
You should've sent me a WUPHF.
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
You know what?
Yes. You alone do, actually.
You too.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
To madness.
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
Yeah.
Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.
Hey Michael.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
What's up? Nice to meet you.
The ones that say '39 cents.'
You've never had Pad Thai.
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring?
Kelly.
No, this little guy is mine.
What?
[knocks on office wall] Hey.
I love you.
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
Mmm-hmm.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
Kelly don't do this.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
No! I will... go.
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
Michael and everybody, umm...
My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
Cool. Cool. OK.
Write it down.
[to Kevin] You scared me.
They have business classes there?
I did not see Rango.
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
This poem would crush you!
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
We can't do this Dwight.
What was that first thing you did?
What are you talking about?
Okay well, that's a relief!
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
Aww!
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
[throwing up]
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
I won't look at it.
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.
Never gets old.
Prison sounds great.
It did, all ready.
Living in the moment.
Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
Will do.
I'm good, thanks.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Write a book.
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
Thought you checker my Tumblr?
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
Fozzie bear?
What about a long sleeve T?
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
So, how are you?
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
I'm betting on myself.
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
Yeah, punch him.
Well...
Yes.
Good work, buddy.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
Yeah.
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
You don't want to recycle them?
Well... you look great.
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
I know it's you guys.
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
[seems unsure] Everything... Everything.
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
I stretched before I came.
