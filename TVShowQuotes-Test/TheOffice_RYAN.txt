How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
For my current investors, things are going great.
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
