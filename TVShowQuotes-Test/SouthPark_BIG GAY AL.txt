Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al.  Have you been outcast?  Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?  Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here.

I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done.  Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you. 

Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals.

Out of... Scouts?

Oh my God. I thought we were past this.
