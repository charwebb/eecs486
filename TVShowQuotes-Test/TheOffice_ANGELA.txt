Yes.
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
No.
Thank you, Michael.
[still sobbing]
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
No.
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
This is how you make this important decision?
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
I've seen some of your spreadsheets.
Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
So, he's alive.
God!
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
No thank you.
I'm just leaving for the day.
No thank you, Roy.
I could see enjoying that.
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
Dwight, that's awful.
No you go. Hi honey!
[approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
Why isn't Jim wet?
It's beautiful.
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
Well, it better work.
A Purpose Driven Life.
I heard a joke today.
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
Last week.
The senator will be joining us later.
I don���t���I don���t know why.
Michael!
Waste of time.
Did you have fun at Benihana's?
No, it's ah...
Ew! Oh.
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
Ow!
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Sparkling cider is very good.
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
Ugh.
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
I would watch that.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
That's why we're cursed.
You don���t want me at your place.
Kevin, Kevin.
[Dwight slaps her butt] Hey!
You don't know them all?
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
What about the surprise?
That didn't happen.
Good afternoon.
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Same page. Go to the next one.
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
Why?
Okay.
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Dwight.
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
What?
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
I look forward to it.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
Ow!
We think you might kill Robert.
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
Well���
Where's my car? Come on.
Yeah.
I think you have me confused with another person.
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
It's fine.
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
Charity.  Bake drive.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
Oh, really?
Oh, God.
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
That doesn't surprise me.
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
No!
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
Yes!
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
No.
No. No.
God!
Okay! Everybody!
Why do you want this cat?
Ahh! Dwight!
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
What? Why did you call me out here?
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
Thanks again, Charles.
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
No.
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
Mmhmm.
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
Well, I���ve changed my mind.
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
So what are your credentials?
You're useless.
Thank you.
That's your toast?
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
Really, Pam...
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Who drives like that?
[ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.
You put her in my freezer.
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Yes.
Andy?
This is my big sister Rachel.
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
And where do you think you're going?
Hmm.
Meredith, too far!
Come on, Dwight.
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
Oh, no.
I'm sure.
On it!
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
