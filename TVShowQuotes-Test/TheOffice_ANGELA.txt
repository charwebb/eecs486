Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
How could you do that without telling me?
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
I think the senator is having an affair.
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
What? Why did you call me out here?
