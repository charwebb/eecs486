And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
How long does it take to get the results?
Can I go back to my desk now?
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
You know she has it out for him now.
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
