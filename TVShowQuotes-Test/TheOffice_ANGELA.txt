Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
What? Why did you call me out here?
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
Will you help me put it over there?
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
