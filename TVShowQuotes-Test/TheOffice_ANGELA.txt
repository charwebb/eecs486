Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
