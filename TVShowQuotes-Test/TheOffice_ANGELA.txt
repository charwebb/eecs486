Gladly. I quit.
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
I can't do it.
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
Hey.
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
Huh.
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
What, Pam?
I am.
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
I never felt safe here.
Fine.
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
[on phone] Hello? Hello?
Any problems?
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
Will you help me put it over there?
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
How about, I leave it up?
That's enough.
Safety partners.
Oh my God.
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
I don���t know.
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
Rachel, are you all right?
You never... you don't like them.
Oh no. [laughs]
I'm not dating you.
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
I have to visit the alchy.
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
Oh, thanks, Oscar. You���re such an angel.
Don't!
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
But I don't see how this is my problem.
Yes, that's the problem.
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room]
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
[grabs cake] Oh. Thank you.
Thank you.
Welcome back.
I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Is that all?
I will not, it's not-
Did you think I stole your baby?
I think we're good.
I know who this is!
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
Oops.
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
Oh, it is warm.
What?
No. You need to sign them all.
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
I don't approve.  I don't.
It's no worry.
Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
Aw, crap.
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
[sighs]
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
Yes!
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
Is just looks bad.
Nosy?
Come.
Allergies.
Why do you want this cat?
You're a freak!
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
[gasps]
Well, I won't tell if you don't.
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
What?
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Thanks again, Charles.
Bless you.
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
The dream team... and Meredith.
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
Manure. Get rid of it.
What? Kevin!
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
What the hell is happening?
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
[flustered] Well... good for Dwight.
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
How did you, um, where did you...
Are you drunk?
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
Where?
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
Ugh. Eww!
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
We can talk right here.
Ugh.
Hey D.
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
What do we do about our heads?
I guess I have.  Huh.
This is how you make this important decision?
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
A little bit.
What do you mean by ���poisoned���?
Good afternoon.
No.
You were supposed to be my friend.
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
Yeah.
What?
[Gives Dwight a knowing look]
Daycare won���t take Phillip anymore.
Ok.
[smiles knowingly]
No.
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
He's blocking me.
Has she done the pageant circuit?
You did kill her!?
No. No.
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
A Purpose Driven Life.
Good morning.
Did you try the petting zoo?
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
I heard a joke today.
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
Cecilia....and Phillip.
