Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
What? Why did you call me out here?
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
I made a vow. I gave my word.
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
You said you would be there for me.
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You're not going to get my permission on this.
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
But I don't see how this is my problem.
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
