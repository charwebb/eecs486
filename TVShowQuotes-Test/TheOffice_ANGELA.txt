I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
Will you help me put it over there?
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
I think you have me confused with another person.
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
I don't know why I write my name on things.
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
