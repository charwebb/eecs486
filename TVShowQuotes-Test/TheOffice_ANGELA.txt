I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
The senator.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
Manure. Get rid of it.
In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
Oh my God! Dwight!
No.
I don't take any prescription drugs.
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
This is my favorite day.
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
Ok.
Psst. Hey. Erin.
It's a new corporate policy.
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
How can she make you get back together with her?
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
[sighs]
Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head]
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
Oh, really?
Hey.
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
[sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God!
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
Perfect!
Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.
I understand.
What?
He's out sick.
Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
Nine, eight, five...
Yes it is.
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
No!
Can you put that down there?
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
Wha -
Probably.
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
Ugh!
Yes, a knee-capping could work.
Nothing. Should be fun.
No one said 'you must have two'
[gasps]
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
Phillip���s your son.
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
Oh, God.
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
Phillip?
I have some ideas about conservation...
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
The glitter is blinding.
It's ridiculous.
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
Mmm-hmm.
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
Sprinkles.
With who?
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
You already did me.
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
Judges and juries!
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
No, none���No, stop. It���s just���
Fine.
We are not married.
Yeah, that's a good one.
That is so unnecessary!
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
Wait, what is this?
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!
Alright.
Oh my God.
Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
Congratulations Dwight.
[upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh!
Kevin?
What is it?
Come on, you're safety partners!
Right.
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
Hello, Pam.
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
What about my cherub figurine?
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
[Spits champagne back into her glass]
Oh, god.
They arrived this morning.
What is this?
What?
I do not wanna talk about this.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
What?
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
That's... no...
My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.
Did you bring your jerky in again?
Yeah.
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
She wouldn't do that. She's a Senator.
Have a great day.
Thank you.
Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room]
No you go. Hi honey!
I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.
Kevin, could you not do that?
He's just trying to push your buttons.
Oh God!
Agreed.
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
Charles, where were you born?
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
No.
And where do you think you're going?
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Oh!
That town is full of history!
Extension 128.
It's after my cat.
Pam, we have a great idea.
Yes!
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
I don't care, but yes.
There's no fizz in this punch. Phyllis!
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
Ew.
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
Yes.
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
It's Angela and Oscar.
[smiles knowingly]
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
No.
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
Yeah, it is, Andy.
Are you serious?  This is so offensive.
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
You saw it?  Describe it please.
Those aren't helpful.
Yeah!
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
