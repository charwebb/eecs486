Well, this is getting us nowhere.
That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
That���s....
Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
Oh, I don���t know. Okay.
[Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
Jim, time for your review.
Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
[squealing]
I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.
You don't need to-
Stop saying no.
Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking���a mural.
I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.
[everyone groans] Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight.
Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
That one looks empty.
Oh, I don't care.
I will see you in seven-
Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.
He doesn't even care.
Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
I���m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let���s-- let���s use an example. Take Erin. Erin���s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
Yeah. I...
Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
[quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
Oh of course, you were adopted.
The quality of mercy is not strained.
Oh God.
Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
Yes?
���Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.���
OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I���m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can���t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.
Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
[laughs mischievously] Yeeeeahhhh! It's almost unbelievable!
[whispers] Pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy���s head].
I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who?
Yes. [Kisses Toby]
I���m sexy Toby.
You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?
