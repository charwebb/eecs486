Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You���re welcome, Andy. And you���re welcome, my own ass.
[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I���ve tried so far is Alpine Select!
Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.
I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
You���ve just got me started. Robert��� is��� a filthy beast. I mean, don���t you get the feeling, he���s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?

Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace.
Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ���Hello. Hi sweetie. It���s Jim. I���m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.���
Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? [knocks] [Dwight turns off the lights] Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? [knocks] Dwight? [whispers] Dwight. [Dwight eats his Bananas Foster]
I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
But he���s flirting with Jim���s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.
That���s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
