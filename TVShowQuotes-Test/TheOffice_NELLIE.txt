Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace.
Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.
I am in too, Pam.
Dwight told me about it earlier.
Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
Well, Angela is the winner.
Oh, it���s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
[As trash is thrown at her] Fluke.
Three...
Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ���full-ass��� it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
What?
Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget.
Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
Whoo!
So far, so good.
It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?
Yes! You! You are soo talented! It���s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton���s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
Mm.
Robert.
[sighs]. How can you be sure?
Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just��� you three, no.
Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he���s a good man and that I hope he feels better.
Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-
[quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
Oh, why, is there something?
How did that look?
Are you insulting my guests?
That was exhausting.
Quite enormous.
Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
Yes?
Shh. [Puts her finger to Toby's lips]
Oh. Oh, I���ll tell you what he does.
No.
Darryl, looking good!
Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.
Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let���s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
No.
So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.
Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual.
By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick [points to Pam]
You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
