I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.
Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?
Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.
Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
It���s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I���m not ashamed of that, But I���m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?
Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
Yeah, you���re right. This man needs to be apprehended.
I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
Oh, your mom���s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. ���Do Not Disturb��� sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'Yes!' So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?
God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
And Filipino. But we���ll break that to her later.
Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!
My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
