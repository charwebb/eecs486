In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
Psst. Say, 'I can't wait to meet him.'
Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I���ve tried so far is Alpine Select!
���A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.���
What did I just say? What did I just say?
That���s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ���Hello. Hi sweetie. It���s Jim. I���m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.���
No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.
It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?
Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
Today, I launch my big charity initiative ���Operation Give Back���. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I���d like to see him piss on that one.
So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It���s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?
Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You���re welcome, Andy. And you���re welcome, my own ass.
It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
