Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
Oh, good lord.
Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let���s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.
Do you think I���d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would���[hit in the face with trash]
Oh, get out, skeleton man!
A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
Psst. Say, 'So who's leading this thing, anyway?'
Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
Ew. That���s not good.
Mm-hmm.
God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
Yeah
Angela advances.
Let me just get the projector working.
No...more...talking.
Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
Yes!
Robert.
Ok, that's enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
No.
Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
Oh, it���s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
He's doing it.
Oh no.
No, no, no, not numbers, no.
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
No no no no.
Hey Toby.
Hm?
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
What are the three pillars of retail?
Why are you sitting down like that?
You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We���ll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won���t we?
[hears knocks on door.] Come in!
You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?
Allow me to solve your problem, then.
Oooohh... you salty dog.
oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Whoo!
