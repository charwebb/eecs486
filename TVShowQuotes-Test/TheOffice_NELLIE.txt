[Reading] ���She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.���
And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?
That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
Yes. I thought I���d you know, be you.
So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ���I'm amazing.���
Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods]
So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
I wasn���t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
The way he just cuts off his arm.
Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I���ve tried so far is Alpine Select!
