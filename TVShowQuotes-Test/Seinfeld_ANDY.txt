You're going to believe that guy?
It's, I mean.
[Begins raising sail] Up she goes!
[chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.
Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
It wasn't either of you.
Hi!
Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.
Oh. Okay.
Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals...
Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
Whoa, where you going?
Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..
Eli Edison.
Great group! Pizza party!
Closing time.
Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what we���re talking about is���basically the speech equivalent��� to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need use���but need need for talk talk.
And the Christmas party.
We lost the account.
Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
Just do it.
Why did you do that?!
Yes?
Haha, what?
[leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]
I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]
You did not, Kenny!
And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy.
I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
No. What?
Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.
Not my slaves, my ancestors���. Maybe. Probably not.
Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight���s meeting.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
So, Stanley, are you really outta here?
Yeah.
Oh, God!
The conference room!
Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
Yeah, even cooler.
Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
Wow. Prison sounds horrible.
Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go...there he is.
[clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour.
This man has a gift!
Did you check the vending machine?
He sure did.
Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys.
My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.
All right, yes! It's a deal.
Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto.
A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy?
Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.
[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... [sighs] No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
All in! Whoo!
Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
Right. Do you see a clue or...
Oh, God, no.  I'm...  Just read the fax.
Jim's talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!
Why don���t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
Seriously, Angela?
Hey guys!  Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!
What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].
[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B's.  They called me Buzz.
[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
17 B.C.
Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
Are you serious?
No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
You all made it, thank you so much.
What, is it because he's black?
Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.
We should think about this���does anyone have any better ideas?
Huh!
Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder.
Well, I'm not signing away my rights.
Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?
Ehh, can't do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.
What's up?
Those aren't straight. Totally crooked. Totally crooked. You're disqualified.
Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
Chicken pot pie.
Oh, okay...
[begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]
Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
Can I think about it?
Yeah!
When I was a salesman I could just be like ���Not my job, not my prob. I���m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.��� Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
Baseball!
I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]
I did stand up comedy once.
Cause that says, that says...
Hello.
You broke my heart too.
I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
Hey! High-five!
Nice to meet you.
Hey!
OooOK.
I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him!
Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?'  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.' ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.
One. Two. Three. Shot!
Did you tell them?
I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
Christmas miracles do happen.
I'm telling you to back down.
I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]
Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
Yeah!  I mean it's a great song.  I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway.  You know?
See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.
I'm thinking about it--
These are incentives.  It���s how we���re gonna double growth. Now, you���re probably all asking yourselves: ���Well, how does this work?���
Come on!
Yeah. Big Tuna, tuna?
Thank you very much.  Now I've got it for you. [holds open door]
Are you blind?!
Books! Excellent, Jim.
Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.
Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.
Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?
Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!
Yes!
[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
I actually had that down in the cons column, but...
We won't let you down.
Sh---
Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
I don't even know what that card said.
That was not a fail.
Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
Okay.
Your text said 911.
I don't think it does that.
Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.
What are you...
Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
Oh God. Come on!
I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
[in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.
A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?
[blowing air horn] Yeah!
Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
What?
[sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-
Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.
I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience.  So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna...
Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?
I really 'Schruted' it.
...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
Eight dollars?
[on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That���s what I call the sun now.
Where are you going?
Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That���s what you did with this trip.
What did you say?
That���s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete���s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
Thank you.
Actor?
Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.
Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.
Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
Well, technically FOR Andy.
Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
All right, who���s next? Nellie?
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
[sits at Dwight���s desk] Got any hot leads?
Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs]  I graduated in four years.  I never studied once.  I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, 'Here Comes Treble.'
[shushing Jim] Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?
All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
Dave Matthews.
There are lots of considerations.
Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.
There is one problem with this plan.
OK. [to Erin] I'll call you later.
You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
You're the only person who's congratulated me.
Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Yeah.
I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]
Well, Carla knows.
Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.
What if you���re being attacked by a 4���11��� man who is penisless?
My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
Woo-hoo.
[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!
There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.
Parkour!
Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
Cool, thanks.
Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
Hey! Pam!
Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?
Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
Oh, okay. I don���t want any part of this.
And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
Thank you.
Yes!
Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they���ve ever been to me. What I wouldn���t give for one of Phyllis��� classic room clearing farts right now.
What?
Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
Good one. Okay, you ready?
There you go. Thank you.
Yeah, which one?
...Erin...
You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.
Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
[outside men's room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out]
I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol��� family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.
So Darryl says to me ���fire me���. But what he really means is ���I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.��� So I say ���No, you're not fired.��� But what I really mean is ���I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.���........I really hope that's what he and I mean.
I can make myself cry.
No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  They���re like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We���re 100 percent staffed up.
Yeah and we���re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you���d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
I do.
Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?
Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
Yeah.
[doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]
The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]
Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?
Okay.
Mmm.
Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....
My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal���s going out on.
Ay-o!
Yeah.
No I didn���t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
Boring. Call me if she rolls over.
Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.
Everybody out.
The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
Okay.
[singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It's gotta rhyme with 'piece.' Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it.
Uh yeah, look at that.
It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.
I insist.
[announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin��� movie star! [kicks trash can]
Oh, oh!
Nah, no. We'll be back before that.
Better a cappella!
You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.
Wait, what?
[surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
Do you think... [bottle rolling] so you think... [bottle rolling, clanking]
There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods.
Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow.
Still waiting on that check.
Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
Are you a student here?
[points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
This kid's costing us sales, Michael.
Why did we pretend like we work here?
What? No, why?
Uh...
No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.
Yes! Yeah.  [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.
Love the belt.
I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!
Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
Does it hurt?
Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
What?
Duuudes, stop.
[removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It���s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That���s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.
So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia. [grossed our remarks from around the office as Andy holds p a picture of a nude man]
I want you to print that out for me.
Thank you.
Well, that, what's that one?
Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.
It���s a photocopy from your notebook.
No! [Erin and Andy laugh]
[singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
[sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
[gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]
...That was weird.
Yeah, OK.
Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
Stop doing that!
In this climate?
No, I do not.
Saving the best for first!
Hmm... mm, what's that smell?
Dwight.
You know what--- I don't---
Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
What would you say?
Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that���s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
[signing his name] Andrew��� Baines��� Bernard.
Yeah.
I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
Mmhmmm.
Well girls tell each other things right?
That seems a little far-fetched.
Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
I'm your wingman.
Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles]
Stanley.
Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
We're gonna do it outside.
[whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling]
Awesome.
That's...
[turns over card] King of hearts.
[enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one.
Dwight, anything?
Pam! Come on!
Maybe it's just more like, 'be mine.'
Here���s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam���
Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.
Atta boy Clark!
With Hors d'oeuvres we only take one at a time.
You said... [makes gibberish noises]
Hey, how are those salads?
Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
God, Toby, don���t���stop blocking my hand.
No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
Everyone else is too drunk.  Just don't let me die here.
Nope! Can���t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss���s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
Umpf���that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
You know, we���ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we���re in this weird dance���.
[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
Fine.  I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book.  Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading.
I didn't mean you should do it. You were supposed to ponder it. It's... You removed the fun. Thanks a lot, Big Tuna.
The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
You're being an idiot get..
Yeah? You like it?
[Darryl runs in slow motion on video]
I don't know yet, I have to call you back.
Do you know the other state?
Look up here!
I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
Hmm.
We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.
Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
How is that relevant to anything?
Right on.
Hey, Lauren. Look at you.
My ass is only so big, I mean I can���t do this everyday.
So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful.
Like a month ago.
All right.
All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.
Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
Hey, what���s goin��� on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young���uns?
Oh! God! [smacks roaches]
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
Walk until you hear the beehive.'
No games?
Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
What?
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it.
Fine. But I could have.
