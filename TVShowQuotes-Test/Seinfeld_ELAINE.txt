Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
Why don't I give you my phone number?
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
Well do you see it or don't you?
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
And then he starts writing on my chart.
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
Did you tell him it was peed on?
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
We should be able to get across right through here!
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
He told you all that? How could he?
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
But you said it was in the store!.
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
Really? You really think I should fire her?
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
