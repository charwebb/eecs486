You remember the date?
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
Oh, very nice.
I, I don't think so.
You sure you want his face?
(Enters) Hey, what happened to you?
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
Well I trust people not to do that.
Cherry Binaca, it?s new.
Oh, yeah...
You are kidding.
I know.
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
Hi.
Mmm.
Kramer, what is wrong with you?
You told him!!!!
But it's Saturday.
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
He's not my boyfriend.
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
What, are you insane?!
Yeah! hmmm..I gotta go..
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
Thank you, Jackie.
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
Well, relationships are very important to me.
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
(encouraging) Dont forget.
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
they-they took it from Tolstoy.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
Huh?
(laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...
Siena?
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
...ok I'll just....
Where?
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
I know.
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
We're straightening out?
Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...
A what?
That's stealing?
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
What about the kiss goodnight?
No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
No, no, no. You give me your number.
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
Five minutes? That's it?
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
Yeah.
I dont know.
Well some people drink coffee that late.
Why couldn't you just wait?
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
Oh, I'm not very good.
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
So what?
You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
Well it did occur to me.
So, what's that?
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
(determined) Eleven thousand!
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
Where did you get my chart?
"What you do!!. You don't do anything."
Just some?
Hu hu, ha ha ha.
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
Im not moving in.
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?
Ah--this is part of the problem!
Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
(sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo.
I need those clubs.
Terrific.
Yeah, but...*I* like the move.
Worked?
You have a water bed?
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
Just a hunch.
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
Id better not.
Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
There is no he.
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
Custom designed?
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Nope.
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
Ahh.
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
What d'you care?
Come on.
I dont care, Im not hungry.
Waddya' write?
Dam
C'mon..
He took it out.
What are you doing here?
Ohh! Stop it! I know.
Like you're a liar!
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
Why not?
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
Uh, Mr. Costanza, I
Hello, hello.
Uh uh, you should go some time.
Right above you?
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
Uh, man!
He said hed give me a lift.
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
What house guest?
Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
We're not going to sit together?
No no, I wanna go.
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Nice to meet you, Poppie.
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
No its not. That really is true.
In them?!
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
Why?
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
Hi Sheila.
So, will I see you later tonight?
(same time as Jerry) --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
I'm not in the mood.
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
Actually I thought he was very professional.
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
I can't have popcorn for dinner!
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
Tell me!
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
We'll see.
(Extremely excited) The other guy?!
What?
Well, wait---wait a second.
Yes.
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
Really? A fight with the foreman?
Why do you have a bug guy?
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!
Me, either!
Why?
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
(frustrated) Just go.
You know we were here, ahead of you.
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
Huh?
Yeah.
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
You took him over to Celia's?
Dinner's good.
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
(caught out) I did. Uh...
Yeah...Jake Jarmel.
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
I do to.
No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
I'd rather not say.
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
(Confused by her reaction) You are?
Phoenix? Whats happening with his appartment?
Do you hear something?
Yeah.
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
What shoving?!
You're a baby!
My back hurts.
Mind? Oh o-of course not.
Nothing.
Well, Here we are.
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
What's going on?
"Yeah!"
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?
So, you think you're sponge-worthy?
No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
You're buying a speedboat?
What's the order?
I believe that's the new minimum wage.
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
Joey? Joey?
She stopped performing.
Uh huh.
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
Oh c'mon, Newman.
Oh uh uh...
What?
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
What are you doing with your old couch?
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
Yes.
Peterman is gonna kill me.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
What do you got, a cucumber?
Theyre dying in the nets.
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
What is this, a 'bit'?
All right, what time do you want me back here.
They're from Malaysia.
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
Jerry!
And the bathroom in your apartment?
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
(slower and louder) I'm kind of swamped.
Fat.
You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know...
Ed.
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
It's a hair.
I dont know.
I just didn't know you watched that.
Which ones?
Okay.
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
I mean, I can't give people orders!
The Drakette took it.
Cookies?
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. (steps down)
He collects (holds up magazine) these?
I think I'll let you do it.
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
No, I just..
What? I can't hear you.
Do you want some of mine?
No, I'm still working on it.
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
Well, actually it's pretty grimy.
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
Cinnamon babka.
Oh, he's not on drugs.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
I don't believe this woman.
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
Yeah. It is kind of cool.
I think you're sticking it to me.
What?
Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.
Copywriter.
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
What?
Aaahhhhh!!
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
I bet your parents were upset, huh?
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
You know why? One word shade.
Who did that? Who did that?!?
David and I will not be getting back together.
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
Take it away.
Where is someone? I'm starving.
No! I won't be a party to this.
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
Eh...he'll get up...
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
Yeah, the address is 78th West...
Oh, yeah. What's that called?
(turning to them, awkward) It's locked..
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
I can't believe we broke up like that.
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
That's a pretty big tip...
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
What happened? It looks the same.
No!
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
*YOU* took my seat!?
Vanessa.
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
I mean, stranger things have happened...
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
Nah it's nothing.
is it?
Why did you get a maid?
I had the roast beef
That will be fun.
Well, a lot of it is vegetable...
Oh, hi.
Oh. My ballet tickets.
We'll see it Sunday.
Vegetable Lasagna!
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
(Through intercom) It's Elaine.
Hello?
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
What?
Oooohh, what about me!
Yeah.
Party of four? Who are we meeting?
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
Yup.
Yeah, no problem.
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
George.
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
Just gimme your keys.
(whispering to Jerry) Yes!
I was with David *Putty* last night.
(vicious) Fifteen thousand!!
What?
Three days.
Of course there's a community.
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
Any other time.
It's Elaine.
(to Myra) He's very highly recommended. So...
I never told you his name.
Have you ever thought about it?
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
Hello.
Raquel Welch!
Oh, he's fine.
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
You sure?
Ill hang this phone up right now!
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
Okay.
Those are JFK's golf clubs!
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
So?
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
All right. Let's go, to Reggies.
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
I'm gonna do a little firing.
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
Then maybe you have a fax machine.
(Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.
Did you say goiter? What goiter?
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
(triumphant) Ha, ha, ha ha!
Yeah, you know (scratches cheek and sniffs)
How about, it sucked?
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
No.
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
A fur?
Then why are we calling?
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
George's Susan?
Definitely. Are you?
This is Aaron.
YOU feel?
Yeah, talked earlier.
No.
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
David, um, I..
Oh quite.
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
Do you want your old couch back?
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited.
Not good. I'm a moron.
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
Alrighty, bye.
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
Why is that name familiar?
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
Really.
Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
Oh. Uhhh...
930
Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
Good day.
Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
Potato.
All right, let's just forget it.
(smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon.
Did you tell Kramer?
Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.
Well if you want it, you get it.
Who is this?
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
We don't walk that fast...
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
Okay.
Thank you...aah, hm mm.
Im going to get some popcorn.
The executor? Of what?
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
No, that's not it!
Yeass.
I'll go to Paris.
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
All right.
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
Bye.
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
(quietly) Give that to me.
Me?
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
What?
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
Ah! Ah!ah!
Really?
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
No, nothing.
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
ooooh ahhh
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
That's the emergency?
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
You missed quite a performance.
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
It's me.
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
The hit and run!
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
Oh! my God.
Did you and Patty just break up?
Hey.
Jerry Seinfeld.
Yep.
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
Hello. This is Todd Gack.
News? What news?
Brett?
What?
Carefully?
(Recognizing him) Peter?
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
Oh thats nothing. Um and anyway um
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
So, what do you think?
Yeah, but come on . . .
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
Alright, gimme the phone... it's my "thing"...
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
Some dinner, huh?
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
Ohh!
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
You signed the release.
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
Yeah.
What?
Well, what did you intend, Hal?
Huh. (pause) Oh my god.
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
You can tip a gardener.
You? I'm more responsible than you are!
And you're taking...
Oh, well that's just *great!*
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
What neck hole?
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
I'll put in a good word for you.
Anybody here? Peterboy?
Books, Jerry.
Uh, that's it.
He's in.
Yeah.
Where is the ambulance?!
You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
I'll see you later.
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
Yeah.
(Nodding) The other guy.
Which one is he?
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
Unless youre married to a dictator.
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
Interesting.
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
I would love to go upstairs.
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
What're you looking at?
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
Hey, when you walk him, do ya...
Hi.
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
I am? But that's so sick.
Anyway...they're real.
Yeah.
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
Oh, please.
Roy!
We just didn't think of you.
Cmon lets go...
What are you talking about?
You know, it's not really that terrible.
Well, they're not kept in little cages.
What's the difference?!!
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
What are you doing?
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
(looking for support) Jerry!
Take a guess.
(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
Is that good?
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
ok step off George, can u just step off?
Don't worry, I...
EZ Bake oven?
So who's playing Elaine?
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
Uhh... no.
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
Hi.
Um, what does Nana sound like?
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
Nice looking family.
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
Yup.
Thank you very much.
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
Get in there!
Well, I, for one, really respect that.
Hello.... hello, oh...
Mr. Lippman, how are you?
Disappointed?
Your guy can't cross to my side?
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
So?
Uhh
Ya!
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
What?
How do you know all that?
He'd just be touching your back.
Oh, Great.
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
Jerrryyy, How can I go on?
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
What?
Hey, what's going on?
Yeah.
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
Casus belli.
did you have fun
All right.
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
(shocked) Oh my God.
(to everyone) Oh, that's the Mohel.
Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
So humm....When you gonna call her?
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
"Top of the Muffin to you!"?
O.K. You start. What's your first choice?
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
Did you ever hear of...holding it in?
Eat your soup!
Yeah? Like what?
What did you say?
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
What?
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
Really?
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
You found out Kramer's first name?
Dogs. Oh I love dogs.
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
But it's a line from that song!
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
What? What are you talking about?
Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh!
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
What?
What?
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
Yeah. See that--
George is on his way up.
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
Excuse me.
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
Right, well...
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
So?
Ah.
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
Uh-huh.
He asked me out for Saturday night.
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
Hey.
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.
(Sincere) I'm sorry.
Well... the counter...was right there, and...
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
Hey.
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
Oh. Big room?
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
Thank you, Julie.
Is that the supermodel?
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
Nah.
Well, I'm so sorry! I-
Oh, lovely.
Ah. ...Yeah.
Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition.
Fine.
And... what would those be?
Of Vincent's picks?
I got a date.
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
Manuscript?
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
You always break even.
(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.
What are you gonna do in there?
But I really enjoy dancing.
You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
It ever happened! Understand?
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
Exactly.
Oh god this tastes terrible.
The K Man did it!
Faux pas?
Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
I'm not Jewish.
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
George! [waves hi]
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
Get out!
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
Your old high school hangout? Why?
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
I told him I was busy.
Yeah.
(Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?
Goodbye.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Oh Thanks, thank you very much.
You can't be bleak in spring.
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
What am I gonna say?
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
Maybe.
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
(indicating) That's her. That's her.
*No*, we would have heard it.
Well we could ...
Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?
The CABIN is on fire!
