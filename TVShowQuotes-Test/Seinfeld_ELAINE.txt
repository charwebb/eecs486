It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
Hey, we told you not to park there!
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
All right and that just about... does it.
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
We're just, you know, having a good time.
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
ok step off George, can u just step off?
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
What? What are you trying to say, George?
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
Well what do you want to give him, change?
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
I never should have given Anna the impression--
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
There is no park and the team has relocated.
George, you got a little something, right here.
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
So tell me more about this game SIX.
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
This was my idea you stole my idea.
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.

I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
