You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
George I don't even want to get --
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
See what is that? Is that a date?
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
I don't like to talk during a massage.
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
Well we can take the car service from my office.
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
This was my idea you stole my idea.
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
The one you broke the plans with tonight?
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
You know we were here, ahead of you.
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
No! I won't be a party to this.
Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
All right! You know what, just forget it!
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
What are you doing with your old couch?
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
He told you all that? How could he?
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
