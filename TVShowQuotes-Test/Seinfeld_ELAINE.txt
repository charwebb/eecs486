Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
So what?
yes, (sob) I suppose,
He was laughing?!
Oh, oh, come on, please?
I will.
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
I...I don't know...
You look ridiculous in that thing.
Oh are you?!
this isn't a very good time George
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
Cookies?
It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
It's a new area code.
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
Hi Peggy.
Maybe.
I did?
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Why not? That's all I want.
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
Jerry Seinfeld.
What?
What did he do about it?
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
What butcher?
"Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye."
What?
Would you please?!
Guess what I ate.
Peter Jennings had one?
Where did you get her?
What?
Yeah. Okay.
So what did you say?
Ah.
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
This car.
What?
Oh, I'm not very good.
Hi, Jer.
I am? But that's so sick.
You would do that?
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
Come on, father, you can make it.
What?
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
That was so good.
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
Jerry, talk to that guy again.
Yeah!
Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
Ugh!
Because it's rude, otherwise.
What time you got?
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
Oh, hi Noel
Huh.
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
Who is he?
Eatin' olives.
Then maybe you have a fax machine.
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
(looking at Jerry) Ohh.
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
(quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it?
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?
No, Castro.
No, I just have a cold.
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Those school zones are a killer.
Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
Yeah, you can get a gardener.
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
Who is this?
No, I guess you couldn't have..
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
But it's a line from that song!
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
You still have no proof.
My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Get out!
What's all this?
... hiking ...
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
That's it. That's it. Stop right here.
Hi. (They kiss.)
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
(Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
"What are you gettin'?"
No, I need it.
In them?!
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
Get off of me!!
Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
Oh, hi! (Waves at him)
Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.
About three years.
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
Hi,
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
Do any of these look close?
Hi!
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
(Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
I think he emphasized "would."
I don't know, I guess.
It's me.
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
(Leaving) That's fantastic.
Um, what does Nana sound like?
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
Yeah.
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
Huh?
Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
"Well. Were you tucked?"
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
You punched who in the mouth?
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
How do I look, Jackie?
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"
She.. was.
Because... Yeah?
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
Ohhh, it's coming in already!
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
Her type? What type?
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
Haven't you done enough to these people?
What? You're Cheryl Fong?
"I know that but why are you going?"
He's incredible.
What?
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
What?
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
I dont think so David, were through.
Mm-hmm.
Oh really?
Well, you can't walk around like that.
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
Sweater.
Dick was fired.
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
Nope.
"He's smart...."
Oh. No, we're not--
(sneezes)
I had to take it again.
Yeah, I am.
Really?
Well come here and take a look.
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
Hem!! No reason.
What was that again?
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
Opium?
Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?
Eh, I like mine.
So now Duncan is back?
And Ill be right upstairs?
You think?
Because it's insane?
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
What are you doing? What is that?
Fat.
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
Robin!
Bye
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
Okay.
What?!!
So you're concerned.
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
But...Jake...
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
I don't know.
What?
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
Well, you know. It's a picture?
Well, that's because you're an idiot.
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
So, we're going out Friday.
Jerry!
Oh great, thanks Kramer.
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
No.
Hello.
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
It's just a stupid movie.
hi
Well stop being such a baby.
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
Of what?
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
Great.
Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.
Pardon?
Oh.
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
What?
Newman plays tennis?
I'm not Jewish.
Yeah.
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
Oh, thank you.
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
(flirtatious) Hi Jerry.
Im not moving in.
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
No, these are saved.
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
How could you not take the directions?
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
No they don't.
OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??
Kramer?
He dared....
She won't even give you a hint?
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
(meek) Yes ma'am.
Well...Poppie. I think differently.
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
What are you guys doing here?
I needed to move a bureau.
(spoken to Testikov) that's a song
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.
On some people.
So what are we gonna get him?
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
Do you mean "reer?"
This is it. I can take this anymore.
Hey.
What neck hole?
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
but what else did they say
Where's Lois?
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
Hi.
They deliver it.
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
Have you thought about an intervention?
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
Bye bye
Okay.
Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
Oh please.. It's in the vault.
(to Nina) Hello!
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
One million.
No, because I slept with my back to him.
How long does a funeral take?
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
What?
What...?
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
You're gonna wear this all the time?
No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
The mannequin!
Yeah.
Forty-seven.
You don't have an old pair?
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
Ga-ga? When did that happen?
E-an
Tomato Sauce?
What?
The dingo ate your baby!
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
(giggles)
Fine.
What is going on with you two?
Leo. Has the doctor been in yet?
I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm)
Yes?
I'm sorry honey.
yeah
ooooh ahhh
It's not bleak - it's springtime.
It took him like ten seconds!
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
Good! I won't!
Did you talk about us?
All right.
Jinx buy me a coke.
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
that's right honey, and I know you!
Right.
Uh uh, you should go some time.
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
Hi! How 'r u doing?
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
(animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends.
I don't think so.
Why didn't you just call out his name?
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
(laughing) No thanks.
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
He didn't mention . . .
Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?
Oh. Thank you.
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
Ow! Careful, it's hot.
How old are you?
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.
What?
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
Actually I thought he was very professional.
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
All right. I'll be back.
Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
So how's it going with my friend?
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
You're crazy.
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
You didn't say this to George, did you?
You want to work here?
Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
Oy vey!
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
So? What happened?
The Truth!, You want The Truth?
It's Elaine.
So what?
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
She was lost...
Donna Chang?
Not so good.
Mr. Peterman, I, uh...
Um, yeah in my purse.
The CABIN is on fire!
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
What do you mean, like laundry?
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
Really?
Yes! Grace!
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
Tell Ping I said hello.
Wa',you don't have the directions?
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
Maybe coffee was coffee.
I guess this one is my fault.
I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
Oh is that so.
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
O, your being auditted? What for?
Forget it.
What are you doing?
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
Okay.
Oh, my God.
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
(Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?
[gasps]
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
I cant remember.
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
Kramer, what's wrong?
I do.
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
That is it!
Twenty-five percent.
When was this?
(Recognizing him) Peter?
Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!
How did you know you cut it?
Did you do with the dogs?
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.
So what?
Yeah.
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
(Between laughs) Jugdish.
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
We're not wilding.
Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned
Lithe.
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
And you feel you're not really ready for,
Why?
(pointedly) Okay. Fine.
Uh huh.
Really? Grace?
Uhh
What do you think their parents think?
Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
Help him move? Move what?
Oh please no more.
Uh, great!
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
How could you say something like that?!
Oh! The subway? From Queens?
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
What?
Diapers.
I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
Oh my god..
Hi (?). Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Showering?
No no no no, it's just...
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
What do you do?
Well we can take the car service from my office.
Hi, I'm Elaine.
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
What IQ test?
What's going on?
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
what is with the gum?
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
I never told you his name.
Hi!
Uh, no ... take it.
Who's faking?
But you said no more painting.
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
The Tonight Show?
The look you just gave me.
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
Uh, it's a riot Alice.
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
Wow! What a story.
I like coffee.
O.K. Thanks.
I think it's B.O.!
Kramer.
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
What do you do?
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
What happened last night?
(shakes head) No.
And he's has a bit of a rash.
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
What's the matter with you?
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
What do I have to know?
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
Is he black..
Oh, sure.
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
When did you tell George to be here?
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
Hey. Oh, is that a label maker?
No, I'm still working on it.
What do you charge for blown shocks?
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
Did anyone call?
Are you sure?
Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff.
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
I am not your pal.
(Through intercom) It's Elaine.
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
Okay, welp... see you around.
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
What is the big deal!!
Where is the ambulance?!
Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
(pause) Bizarro Jerry?
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
Ah, . . .
Ya know?
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
This chicken is really good.
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
You mean like like?
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
Look, just because I'm a woman...
Boys are sick.
What list?
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
I know.
I can be very clever.
Shhhhhh!!!
What happened?
Okay.
(seriously worried) Wha...?
Sorry. Somebody...help us!
Those are JFK's golf clubs!
Who was it?
Too bad.
Yeah, right.
Huh.
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
(angrier) Thirteen thousand!
Wha..wha...?
(embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters.
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
Three notes?
Cinnamon babka.
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
Well, it's just one more day.
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
Oh!
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
Bye.
What!?
You got that right.
(Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm.
Yeah.
Make it clear?
Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
I think she'd figure it out.
Why?
Uh, no. Not really.
You get out of here!
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
Why is that name familiar?
I don't wanna!
Where you going?
Jerry--
(Shrugging) I thought all guys do that.
No thanks!
Judy .
Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
(CONT'D) Where have you been?
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
I told you, I can't hear a word.
Aaron
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
Can I get you anything?
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
(indicating) You remember Katy?
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
Oh, dear.
Bye-bye.
No.
Who's he?
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
"What are you talking about?"
Oh no, lets do it now.
A LeBaron?
Oh, hi.
Hello.
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
Sure!
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke!
No, actually, you're not being funny now.
Oh!!!
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
Thank you, Jackie.
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
Having a good time!
(on buzzer) Meh.
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
Can you let go of my tongue now?
Good morning, Jackie.
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
What do you care?
(tossing the ball back) Yeah.
(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
Who's stopping you?
It's possible.
Yeah, I suppose I am.
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
It's a beautiful couch.
Hi, I'm Elaine.
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
Say what? (laughing) Say what?
I love Cajun cooking.
Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom)
Who Gendason?
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
So, guess who called me.
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
Let me think about it.
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
'Cause he gave me his.
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous.
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)
I *loooove* horse manure.
What?
They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic)
(whispers) Poor bastard.
Can he do that?
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
No.
(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
We just didn't think of you.
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
Oh.
You're quitting?
Hey, is that real fur?
Who's Kristin?
You gotta open the vault.
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
That's what I'm saying.
Very mature.
Hey, I did it.
She keeps track of everything.
Jerry.
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
I know.
Oh. How much you got left?
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
Yeah, pretty much.
I see.
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
[mind] What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy.
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
(To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
No, I can't.
Whatever.
Yeah, nice to see you, too.
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
Try it on.
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
What?
I will never understand people.
I said, All Right.
(Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
But why? Why can't you do it?
So you know , ... he called me.
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
Hmm. I never take them.
Are you sure you want us here for this?
All right, what the hell.
I guess.
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carousel.
You wanna know what I said?
Ok, ok ok ...
I am his nurse... Poloma.
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
Ill take it!
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know...
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
I though I'd never find it.
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
But he's so small.
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
hi, nice to meet you finally
Missing?
Kramer, this is too big.
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
You always break even.
Um, well what's the difference?
Okay.
Yeah...
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?
uh-uh.
No way.
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
Yeah.
