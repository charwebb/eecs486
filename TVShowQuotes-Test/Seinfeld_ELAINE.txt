Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
And I want my keys back from you!
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
Id do it but I dont have any money.
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
No! I won't be a party to this.
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
I can't believe we broke up like that.
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
What did you have to say that for?
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
What the hell is this? Where are you?
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
This food was in the shower with you?
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
You're not still thinking about that are you?
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
And you feel you're not really ready for,
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
I guess it was just a matter of time.
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
All right and that just about... does it.
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
She's the one you went out with last night?
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
I need something to read on the subway.
You don't have the label maker, do you?
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
