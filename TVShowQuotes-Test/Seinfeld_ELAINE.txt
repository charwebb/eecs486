No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
Well, what do you want me to do?
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
What is that noise? What is that noise?
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
Well do you see it or don't you?
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
Things occur to me from time to time.
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
He told you all that? How could he?
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
How do you even know the jacket is there?
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
We should be able to get across right through here!
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
I really think it's the size of your neck.
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
