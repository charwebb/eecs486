Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
I can't believe we broke up like that.
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
And he's has a bit of a rash.
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
I just said the same thing to you.
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
I don't like to talk during a massage.
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
I told you, I can't hear a word.
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
What are you doing with your old couch?
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
No. We were both in the mood for one.
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
I thought my idea was just as good.
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
This was my idea you stole my idea.
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
