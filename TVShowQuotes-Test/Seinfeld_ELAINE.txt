We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
Where's Lois?
Yes, she's very upset.
What?
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
Yeah.
(pointing) Right here.
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
Dana Folley.
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
 Jerry! Over here...
(Suddenly angry) What?!
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
Well do you see it or don't you?
(quietly) I can cancel.
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
You weasels!
Hey, I didn't even use one.
No, no, not Putumayo.
You know I really hate my clothes.
Where did you find it?
Well, no point in wasting $1,200.
Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
(pointedly) Okay. Fine.
Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
(squeaky) Sure, sure.
Uh...
He seems to be breathing.
What? What happened?
Yeah
I'm sorry.
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
Yeah, so they say.
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
Oh hey! How things doing in accounting?
Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?
Well use a paper towel.
But I didn't do anything.
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
(offering a drink) Snapple?
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
What are you doin' there?
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
Reggies? I can't eat anything there.
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
Stop _ the _ fight!
Yeah, it's a bra.
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
Why?
Whatever you want.
(caught out) I did. Uh...
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
What did I do?
Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...
Huh?
(shocked) What?
They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic)
Are you out of your mind?!
Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
I don't know. It's a building.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Missing?
Oh, very nice.
Over you?
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
Any other time.
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
Really?
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
(shocked) Oh my God.
Huh. (muttering) This should be interesting.
Remember that Columbus book?
No, I don't.
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
No, no. Im fine.
Justin Pitt?
Boogey?
So, what did you say?
All right, let's just forget it.
It's black, right?
Really?
No, you can't be trusted!
Hi. Can I get to my seat?
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
Are you sure you want to do that?
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
Just go.
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
Later!
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
At Yankee Stadium?
No.
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
I Like Her!
unbridled enthusiasm...?
AH! I've got it.
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
You were you, but, you werent you...
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?
This chicken is really good.
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
Can we rest here a second.
...ok I'll just....
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
Why?
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
But it's a line from that song!
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
There's a feather in your cap.
All right.
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
Did you have a nice ride?
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.
Want to go get something to eat?
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
Seems to be.
He dared....
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
Well, you know, I...
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
All right, see you later.
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
So, he's...
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
Hi!
I dance fine.
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
What's this one?
I know.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
Oh! Do tell sir?
What?
Well stop being such a baby.
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
Yeah. That's right.
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
Oh please.. It's in the vault.
Is she?
How did you know?
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
Wh..?
Everybody does. Bye-bye....
No, I got caught.
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
(frustration) Ugh!
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
Will you shut up? I can't hear!
Did anyone call?
Call him again.
"Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's."
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
We're just, you know, having a good time.
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
Come on, don't be a baby.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
So then what?
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
No.
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
uh?
A cookie!
I guess it's you, Jer.
Wha- a picture?
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
Went out with Cynthia.
I can't tell you.
You still couldn't kiss her?
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
It's Joe Mayo's coat.
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
Hey!
What? What?
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
No.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
(giggles)
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
Hello
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
Drake gave her the TV?
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
(nods) HumHummmm....
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
Because... Yeah?
You're gonna wear this all the time?
(on buzzer) Meh.
What don't you know?
You pick it up?!?
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
[laughs appreciably] Okay, gimme the `adult'.
What happened?
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.
What? No good?
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
They're um, Botticelli's.
Hmm. Tonight.
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
That seems about right.
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
Yeah, who speaks Korean?
(Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.
Right on baby. (???)
Why?
Too bad.
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
[mind] What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy.
No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!
Oh god, Who's suitcase is this?
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
(Passionately) Oh Bob! Bob!
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
Oh. Uhhh...
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
Oh...well...
He told you about our conversation?
Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know.
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
We did. We're just hanging out.
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
What about the dogs?
The kitchen?!
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
Go.
Do I know him?
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
What'd I say?
Uh, uh.
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
I think I can tell.
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
What?
I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
He is a Maestro.
Is that tomorrow?
Hi. (They kiss.)
Right
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
Uh, aw, KL5-239O.
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
Right... (nodding)
No, that's not your coat.
Not so good.
I guess this one is my fault.
No no, I wanna go.
That's just because your a jackass.
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
I think they went out to dinner.
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. (steps down)
He did the move.
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
Oh, my God... The Mohatma?
So? What happened?
Like clams.
Well, what is it?
When are you leaving?
(quietly) Ok.
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.
Green Lantern.
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
All right, Jerome, I'm in.
So what? That's easy.
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
Oh, probably caught in traffic.
Yea.
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
George, come on! I'll pay for you.
(pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.
Nana?
Get out!
(mouths silently) That's perfect!
What the hell was that?
(gasps) I cannot believe this!
What smell?
Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
Who is he?
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
Bore-ing.
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
Make it ten.
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
Hu hu, ha ha ha.
Yeah. Definite moisture.
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
Okay...Thanks a lot for the ride.
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
Do you see it or don't you?
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
He is not a drug addict!
Jerry!
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
We, there are always a few.
I hate this.
Hmm! Rico!
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
Street toughs took my armoire?
Ah, this really sticks in my craw.
Alrighty, bye.
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
Um. Kramer!
Hi.
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
You still got that Fedex?
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
(forcing a smile) Hi.
Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.
Oh! boy.
Literally.
Definitely. Are you?
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
(to another passenger) Huh. You believing this?
Where's my water?
What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.
Uh, no. Not really.
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
What did you say?
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
It is..
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
There are plenty of things to say.
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
Start smoking.
Yeass.
Oh, he's not on drugs.
"Elaine, ya gotta have a baby." Ugh.
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
So, we're going out Friday.
Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
Get out!
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
(Just making conversation) Oh yeah?
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.
What did who say?
Just read it!
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
No, no no.
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
You mean...?
George I don't even want to get --
Whats the rent?
Hey!
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
Consomm, hmm.
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
(Pausing) Even so.
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
Where are they goin'?
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
He's got it.
You know, Kenny Rogers has a-
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
You're not serious.
Eight-fifty.
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
What's going on?
No.
All right, we're done here.
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
Oh. No, we're not--
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.

I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
I knew those condoms were defective!
That is it!
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
You remember the date?
Dam
It shrinks?
I'm sure you could.
Yep. Yeah..
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
Hi, (sighs) you got the organizer?
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
Uh, that's it.
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
Oh...
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
(shouts) I hate it!!
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
No?
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
I don't know.
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
The roommate's.
Uh, no, thanks.
"Yeah!"
Right. Go right!/South!
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
Yeah.
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
What if a handicapped person needs it?
Oh Thanks, thank you very much.
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
We'll see.
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
A seemingly infinite supply.
I'm *really* hungry!
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
So?
What about me?
Alright, there's no---
Pardon?
Yeah, no problem.
Oh...(falls in to the sofa.)
. . . What does that mean?
(Sarcastic) Oh.
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
Jerry?
Oh, thanks. I've got plans.
Hi Cosmo
Great...
Hey, what happened to you?
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
Why couldn't he be a dunker?
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
(sneezes)
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
What do you think their parents think?
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
Nooo.
Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
I know, it's just something you have to say...
You really think he wants the bike?
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.
What, are you insane?!
I gotta go. (Hangs up.)
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
What is this about?
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.
Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
(looking up to the salesman)
Get out!
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?
(laughs)
Ok,
Faking what?
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
I should have never left him alone.
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
Oh.
Arrive?
Hello, hello.
You found out Kramer's first name?
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
Have you noticed she never laughs
What? What sweater?
Well, I felt a call for one.
No, no, it's okay.
Why not?
What do you think of the catalog?
Answering machine.
Its killing you isn?t it?
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
[annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.
Good workout?
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
Well I don't care. It was delicious.
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
No.
What's that?
(softly to Dick) Dick.
(embroidering) Some corn.
By marriage.
Your crazy!
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
Head to toe.
Yeah
Oh c'mon, Newman.
(nit) It's Susie.
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
Why?
You were snooping.
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
I got him a two-line phone.
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
Wow!
Take it away.
Oh no, lets do it now.
I didn't say it.
No problem.
What extremities?
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
You're a taking person.
You're gonna pick up the pieces.
Ah! Orgasm?
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
A big coincidence.
Who was it?
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
Great... [To herself] Help me...
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
What is wrong with everybody?
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
(to George) Mm-hmm.
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
You know Sue Ellen Mishke?
The balance beam?
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
(shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God.
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
So, guess who called me.
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
Where's Jerry?
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
Gimme ten bucks and find out...
(to Mrs Allister) Janitor's meeting.
A fake number! Blimey!
What?
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
Oh, hi.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
(Confused) Love newton?
What was that again?
It's me.
(excitedly) Okay.
What, you think I should have?
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
Sauce me.
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
Uh huh...
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
At the movies.
What is the difference?
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
All right. Let's do it.
How do you even know the jacket is there?
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
Desperado.
You asked me to.
I'm not even in here!
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
So it wasn't a bomb.
No.
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
What? Was it something I said?
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
Oh, oh, come on, please?
Yeah, what?
Swan Lake, at the Met.
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
What kind is that?
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
Shhhhhh. Here.
Yeah.
Yes (clears her throat) yes I did.
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
Hi.
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
So what?
Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
Elaine Benes.
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
Mm-hm.
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
I'll bet they were even in on it.
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
He has good days and bad.
We can't ask him...
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
Yeah...
yeah.
