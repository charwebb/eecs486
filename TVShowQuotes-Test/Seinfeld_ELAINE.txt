I guess we could've called for help.
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
Absurd!
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
What was that again?
Right on baby. (???)
(caught out) I did. Uh...
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"He's smart...."
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
Let's make it fifty.
Donna Chang?
Mm-Hmm.
Good morning.
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
Eatin' olives.
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
I was just kiddin, around.......
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
I wouldn't be comfortable.
OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
The Truth!, You want The Truth?
Oh, gorgeous, yes.
[gasps]
In the office.
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
Do you think of anything?..
Oh quite.
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
Forget it.
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
Oh, so---so that's it?
Maybe.. All over your face!
It's possible.
No, still Sharon!
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
I though I'd never find it.
What do you do?
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
Yeah.
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
Boy, you don't look good.
What extremities?
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
Right. African.
You can still go.
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
You haven't told him?
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
What?
Come on tell me what happened.
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
Huh.
Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.
You flinched.
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
I told ya'. He has ideas.
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
Potato.
Make it three hundred.
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
No, really.
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
(distractedly) Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make...
You think?
(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.
You have no idea?
Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
Alright. Forget it!
Well, maybe.
How did you...
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
You're wrong.
Why not?
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
I don't know - it just is.
Then why are we calling?
Devastating.
Kramer...
Leo. Has the doctor been in yet?
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
Yeah, yeah.
In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
Really?
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
(downcast) Yeah.
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
Did you talk about us?
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Uh,
Good luck.
What?
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
(gleeful) The fish!
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
Pffft....there's really nothing to do.
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
ooooh ahhh
I know!
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
What'd I say?
How close do you get?
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
Must wean.
No, that's not your coat.
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
Wait, what pizza place idea?
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
It... works!
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
So it wasn't a bomb.
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
Ya.
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
[laughing]
What is that noise? What is that noise?
(weary) Jerry!
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.
Let me think about it.
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
What's `medium'?
Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine.
Who is that?
Yeah.
Ohh.. my..
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
Cheryl Miller's brother?
I just didn't know you watched that.
Why is that beautiful?
Terrific.
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
I'm *really* hungry!
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
He schnapped me.
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
What's the order?
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
I know that look.
Hello.
Hi Sue Ellen.
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
The cat.
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
Hello, hello.
Tell Ping I said hello.
So humm....When you gonna call her?
Mr. Peterman?
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
So I'm not gonna be an usher?
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
You know karate??
Oh, Please.
What about the kiss goodnight?
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?
Kramer, what's the matter with you?
Better, now.
Jerry?
Would you please?!
I'm sure you could.
Hi.
(mouths silently) Okay.
Twenty sponges should be plenty.
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
Uh huh.
So that's it?
Uh, excuse me.
Yes it is!
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
Yeah.
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
Karen?
Yep.
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
Shut up...
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
Yeah?
Mr. Costanza, I,
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
Yeah.
Are you going down?
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
What? What is goin' on with you two?
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
(to Paul) You're checking it out?
Hiiii Kramer
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
(Overly generous) Hi, David!
Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
Well ...
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
Really? A fight with the foreman?
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
Three days.
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
Did you find the place alright?
Cmon lets go...
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
First the sucking then the weaning.
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
All right, I'm gonna go.
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
What's your line?
Is that good?
It was..uh.. John-John.
Oh!!!
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
Nah, we just play defense.
Yeah.
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
Nothing.
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
Ah, Susan uses the sponge.
I didn't say anything.
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
What? What?
I'm going in .
Well, you can't walk around like that.
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
I'm gonna do a little firing.
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
(as Darryl opens his door) Hey.
"War and Peace."
Is this Noreen?
No they don't.
Oh Jerry, dont blow this for me.
Stop _ the _ fight!
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
Really?
...so much. You're so damn...sexy.
(LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
What is this?
Oh, it's been a while.
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.
Diapers.
So? What do you want me to do about it?
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
Jerry, She looks exactly like you.
(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
Jerry!
I thought that was pretty good, huh?
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
What, you don't think she's beautiful?
No....Oh No....
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
Oh yeah.
It works.
But we were here ahead of you.
Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry.
Aah!
Not so good.
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
I can't believe we broke up like that.
Andre?
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
What? What happened?
I just thought I could write it.
You stole her clock?
(gesturing) There's this.
Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?
Okay, I'm done.
Oh my god.
(nods) HumHummmm....
And... what would those be?
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
We didn't come in over there!
On occasion.
Oh, it was a frame-up.
Did you tell Kramer?
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
Yep.
What are you doing here?
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
Why? Is it irrevocable?
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
Deal with it. Be a man!
It felt like a couple of levels.
No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)
Yeah, there is, right here you see--
Yeah, they flip a coin.
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
Hello?
It's PLO blend.
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
Yessiree Bob.
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
I cant remember.
Oh.
What happened?
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
Who told you this
Uh, I guess I hadn't--
Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
Did you give him the room number?
Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?
Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
Hello, Tim.
No, I don't want the man either.
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
(Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.
Uh... (clears her throat) Rifkin.
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
I hate this.
Right there.
Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
How long does a funeral take?
A pleasure.
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
No, I'm watching my weight.
50
What?
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
How do you know?
He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
Its that bad?
What's the difference?
You can.
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
I am never gonna fall asleep.
(laughs) What?s all this?
Thank god I found you..
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
Mr. Peterman.
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
I think they might be real.
You never know.
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
(to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?
Hi.
Whoa.
I think he emphasized "would."
Yeah.
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
Ok, so now what?
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
Just a little off the side...
That's sounds pretty juvenile.
I have no idea.
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
Mm-hm.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
Why?
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
"It's me?" Isn't it a little premature?
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
Hi, Mr Peterman.
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
It's Vegetable Lasagna.
Oh, he went insane?...
Yeah. What, is it a problem?
I faked it.
Ah Oh!!
I just said the same thing to you.
Well, I couldn't help it. "Moland Spring"?
Yeah...
Is that something?
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
You still couldn't kiss her?
Why couldn't he be a dunker?
What kind of soup did he get?
You think Ihave grace?
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
I am never going back to the movies again
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
Is he black..
Yeah, I suppose I am.
Yes, Mr. Pitt?
Robin!
You smoke?
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
Boys are sick.
The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
What do you think their parents think?
Cash?
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
Jerry?
(Enters) Hey, what happened to you?
Why Japan?
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
(squeaky) Sure, sure.
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
You're eye still hurts?
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
Um, yeah in my purse.
What's the difference?
Yeah.
You found a hair in your Farina?
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
We never dated in winter.
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
Can you believe this woman?
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
There's no time.
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
Really.
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
I guess I'll just--
hey you got a problem with Tony?
Where'd you get this?
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
Not, my Tim Whatley?
George I was just kidding around.
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
Jerry?!
George. How come you're whispering?
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
What?
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
The sax player?
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh!
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
Huh!
Good night
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
Oh, no! I thought--
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
Who's Reilly?
Hi, Toby.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
What do you think?
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
Hey, Joe Mayo.
Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend Paul.
What? KRAMER, I'll do anything.
(Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.
Yeah.
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
You were you, but, you werent you...
Are you okay?
Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
(slower and louder) I'm kind of swamped.
You've been an enormous help.
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
How'd it go? George?
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
Why is that?
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
Ah, right there, yeah.
What? JERRY Where's the car?
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
What's going on?
Uh-hu. And do you know what happened?
Oh! really.
No, no, not Putumayo.
Oh, that's nice!
Really? Wow.
Oh. Well, Usha.
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
No thanks.
What were your.. demands?
Jerry!
No?
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
They make it longer?
Nothing. He walked me home.
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
He's not my boyfriend.
No. Do you ever think about it?
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
Oh my!
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
I don't like to talk during a massage.
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
I can't believe this!
Yeeeahh!!!
You think I should have asked George?
Whhhy?
Huh?
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
JERRY Cosmo?
You're gonna pick up the pieces.
Really?
Yeah!
You know the Three Tenors?
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
Why didn't you stop me?
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
What happened? It looks the same.
Again you are telling me to shut up?
Bye-bye.
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
The New Yorker has poetry.
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
Well, it's just one more day.
Hi. Can I get to my seat?
is it?
Ghandhi?
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
Uh-huh.
Hey boys!
Who was it?
George.
What?
I don't know.
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
How did you know you cut it?
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
You're soo good lookin'.
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
Ah,
I wish.
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
Sure.
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
A Ziggy?
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
(laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
Nothing.
What's it?
Hey.
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
Huh. (pause) Oh my god.
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
So how long did they drag you?
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
I guess this one is my fault.
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
So.
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
Okay, so fine. Go.
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
That is so ridiculous.
Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
Mrs. Winston?
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
Uh, aw, KL5-239O.
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
Get out!
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
Street toughs took my armoire?
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Oh are you?!
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
Oh. Thank you.
I believe that's the new minimum wage.
[To Jerry] What about you?
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
Well, it's for my boss.
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
Please, please. It's really, really itchy.
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
Who are you, my uncle?
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.
Oh yeah? How'd you do?
(exhales)
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?
Kramer.
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
Whats going on? What is that look?
Milhouse.
All right. Spill it, Jerome.
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
Hmm.
Seems to be.
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
Well, that's your problem.
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
Well, I'm so sorry! I-
What?
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
You're not too cold?
Like ...humm...How did she sound?
Yes.
You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.
Ga-ga? When did that happen?
What?
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
(laughs)
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
What happened?
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
David
Right
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
Couldnt be happier.
Uh, no ... take it.
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
Hello.
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
(Pausing) Even so.
Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
How much is this?
Who is this?
Ah.
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
He is?
Hi Cosmo
You missed quite a performance.
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
Well, can I introduce you as doctor?
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
Oh, bye. Good to see you.
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
(Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
Alright, let's do it.
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
I didn't hear anything.
Ill eat out.
(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!
Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
Well, why didn't you say no!!
Well, that'll get you goin' right there...
I found it!
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
Why?
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
You want to work here?
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
Hey, we told you not to park there!
What was that?
Help us up so we can cross the street?
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
You do?
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
A wedding?
You pick it up?!?
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
You gotta follow that car!
Here.
Malaysia. I was in the area.
You got me an apartment in the building?!
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
Really cold.
(not sure) I guess.
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
Uhhh...
"Yeah!"
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
That's it. That's it. Stop right here.
Un-huh.
I, uh, wait,
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
What's goin' on?
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Well how about a carrot cake?
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
(to everyone) Oh, that's the Mohel.
Do you want your old couch back?
