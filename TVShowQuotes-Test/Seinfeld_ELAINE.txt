Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
What did you think, that would impress me?
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
Are you sure you want us here for this?
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
What? What, you dont want to go now?
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
You didn't say this to George, did you?
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
So then why are you seeing her again...
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
Well what do you want to give him, change?
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
And then he starts writing on my chart.
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
All right and that just about... does it.
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
I thought my idea was just as good.
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
