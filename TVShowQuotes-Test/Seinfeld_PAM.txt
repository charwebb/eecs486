Oh. Oh God.
[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
Jim's on to me.
Some people.
I reminded you last night.
I know.
What���s going on?
Bye.
I'm not gonna do that.
And that was our summer.
Mmm-hmm.
We're not dating, I'm engaged.
Hey.
Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards.
Exactly.
Sure.
Everything's fine.  We have plenty of time.
[on the phone] Yeah, that's no problem.
Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.
I don���t think you guys understand why we���re doing this. It���s-
Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
[shushes]
Jim.
Ok, you've got to pull it together.
That's awesome. Where are you staying?
Oh, thanks, Kelly.
Hey!
Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
Oh, God.  Oh, no.
Michael...
Hmm. I think Jim���s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
How is that better than a barbecue?
Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.
Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
I know. You miss Angela, don't you?
She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?
Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you're going out with Jim.  I'm not going out with Jim.  You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
Yeah, well, get used to it, bud.
I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
Oh, I, um...
No.
Mmm, hmm.
It's kind of an impoverished country.
Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.
Oh.
Nope.
Why was he making her laugh so much?
[on phone to Jim] There���s nothing down here.
I wasn't really going for anything.
Ooh, Toby!
Is it for the bird?
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
It's really nice.
Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines?
Oh, no, Kevin, it���s not a joke. Angela���s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
No, no.
This is a new cardigan.
Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.
[to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.
Um, actually, funny story -- I didn���t get it. I shouldn���t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
[on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.
What do you think his chances are?
We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...
I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.
Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
Yep.
You have to go?
Mmmhmm.
[to friend] Nice.
I'm inventing new diseases.
Does she smell?
And Tom...
Okay, stop.
[Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.
Oh, um, well, you know, I��� I just��� I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you���d been filmed for nine years of your life, there���d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
Yeah, me too.
Thank you.
Very interesting.
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Do you think that they're like-
There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
This is weird with you facing the other way.
I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
You couldn't fix it.
How do you come back from that?
MmMm. You're getting colder.
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
No.
Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
Um, I am a little busy.
Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
Oh.
Yes boss.
Hey.
���Are the pens here?
That's a really big decision.
Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
Ohh... [they hug; she laughs]
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
Love you.
[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
[to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.
[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Ok, drama.
How is it going?
Still no one calling.
I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.
Da-das.
What's up?
[sighs] Nevermind.
Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
Look at this.
That's a sad story.
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Okay, we're going.
I'm so sorry.
I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.
No, we weren't.
So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
Nice.
Because he accomplished something.
It's okay. I'll see you at home.
Okay, Okay. Um��� so��� this past year has been really great, and you���ve been great and I just��� I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn���t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture��� and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
Yeah?
Ryan, just tell us your plan.
Hey.
Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.
I want you to be Grandma.
Can't back out now, Halpert.
No, Michael.
Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]
No.
They have art classes?
[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
Yeah, wasn't that neat?
Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
Yes, I have been working with you forever.
I like cheesy.
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
Shoot, she fell off.
Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
I'm more of a dog person.
The professors would go to the parties?
[laughing] Gross. I love it.
Life is Downton Abbey.
Boo!
Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
Ooh.
[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
[confused] What?
Go!
Michael, wait!
Sorry.
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
What is that?
Oh, good.
Ah. Ahh. [walks out]
Oh.
Absolutely, I do.
Jim, what?
Yeah. I know, me too.
Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
Sure.
Aw! That's great Toby.
No, I should probably go too.
I got it.
Hey Charles.
Not the car!
Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
Oh, he's cute.
Michael, Jan's on line two.
No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.
I think he meant personal day.
Wow.
In his office. You can go right in.
Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year's resolution board.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
It was, sweetie.
Yeah.
Hey, do you have a second?
Two children, yes.
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
I���m training a temp to be my replacement while I���m on maternity leave. Oh I should���ve mentioned I���m pregnant. You probably didn���t notice because it���s impossible to tell I���m so small. But yeah I���m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!
You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
I'm Pam Halpert.
Yeah, okay, I���m sorry. I���m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.
Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.
[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
Ok.
No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
Is that the police?
Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier.
Cool... This is your desk.
No.
Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
Because everything makes me cry, so what���s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Closer to the epicenter, I guess.
[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.
Entering the....
Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]
Sorry!
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?
Yeah.
Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
Dwight, am I hot right now?
20 past 5.
Hey, Hon, are you close?
I am. You should come dance with us.
Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.
Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?
Fine.
Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
Mm-hmm.
I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
Bye.
Oh! Uh, uh I'll go.
[laughs]
Legends of the Fall?
I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
You are never going to be my father, you get out!
You bought me a house!
Hi, Pam, hello.
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]
Oh very.
Why did you put it off until Halloween?
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
Well I'm not the receptionist.
Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
PM.
I can't find my glasses.
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.
[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]
When does he hear?
Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
Yep.
Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
If you wanna do something for the funeral...
No, come back! No, no, no!
What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!
Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
I'm so sorry, Michael.
You came in at 10:30 today, right?
You should try it sometime.
Agreed.  But that's all, okay.
You should get more sleep.
Get whatever you want, on me.
Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-
I do.
Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
I just feel kind of tired, you know.
He brought a sled.
So, you're okay?
Just checking in, how's it going?
I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
I just wanted to see you!
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
Wow.
I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
No...
Thanks.
Wow.
Okay, that���s enough. [grabs phone]
You're good to talk to.
I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
I'm gonna return it.
Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]
Oh boy.
I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.
Thank you.
I'm all over it.
He's from that company in Pitts...
I did?
[smiles]
Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]
Oh, my God.
Dwight, let me up.
Michael, it's freezing out.
It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael.
[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.
Last night? Let's see.
We already offered free delivery!
Are you kidding?
Not enough though.
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
Sure.
Your brothers took you out drinking?
Oh. You've changed so much.
Thank you.
Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it's on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
Of course.
Okay.
Even if she's not getting anything?
Shut up. I'm trying to be serious.
Night, Michael.
Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
[sighs]
No, that was a long time ago.
Aw, we're doing it.
That's great. [Meredith scowls]
Wow, an ultimatum.
[stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
Wow.
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Not really, because I found one.
Oh, well, Thursday���s tough, because of���
Angela?
Did somebody call Hank?
Yes.
Or in a great chair.
Yeah, but this is different.
[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
I'm sorry, he's not in right now.
You can't leave anyone out.
You want to play pool?
Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
Let's just- let's go.
Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
What's up?
Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.
Well ���
I was after your money.
I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
Hey. How you doing?
OK.
You mean yesterday's paper.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
So what is your gift?
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
You're costume is fantastic! [laughs]
You have to settle down first.
Yep.
I want her to meet Michael.
Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
[Holds the mouse trap up] Mouse trap.
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
My husband would tell you to go for it.
Night
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
Huh. What about Cathy?
[laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
David, what are you doing here?
Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.
I am Dr. Cinderella.
All right. Cool, well... thanks.
I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
Ok. She's ok?
[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...
Baby.
Uh-huh.
And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Sure.
How about the anchor?
What?
Thank you, Dwight.
Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go?
I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]
Oh yeah. That's too bad.
I'm working on it Kev.
I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
Who? The -
Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
So it's a man?
Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
Okay Ben Franklin!
[makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam!
Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
But, no, but we are a family.
Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
Um, usually like that.
Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
Uh huh.
Angela is such a liar!
What do you feed her?
Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
No.
The ones that say 'love' on them?
[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.
[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?
No, that's Afghan.
It's good to have you back.
Really, where?
[whispers on bluetooth] Good luck.
Yeah.
One of the tickets is for him.
What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
I know.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
Hey.
What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody's personal business!
No.
[giggles] Okay, see you later.
[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
Michael, that seems impossible.
[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.
...Would You Rather?
Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?
Thank you.
No, my all time favorite!
Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
That there are no rules.
Yes.
[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?
And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.
A world where you truly can be anything you want.
[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
[long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you...
What?
Seventy-six percent. What's yours?
Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.
Here?
Michael, you have to put your hands down.
Yeah.
Um��� yes. Definitely. With your hair ���
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
Uhh, I think it's something like umm...
OK, I like your food.
Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Well, thanks for being a good friend.
Oh my God.
So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way.  You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
Okay. What? What is this?
Because I���m so glad you���re back, baby, but I���m just���I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you���re giving up so much.
I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
Ok, it was the second one.
People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
Mm-hmm.
Well, wait.
Kevin!
Automatic voicemail.
No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
So embarrassing.
I thought we were having a nice time.
Thanks.
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
Great.
Michael...
Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
Michael!
[as others eat] Wait!
[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?
Hmm-mm.
Now please.
Yeah.
Oh. You want to talk about it?
Yeah!
Thank you.
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Uh, yeah. Just a fax.
New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
It's terrible.
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.
Ok
New chairs?
Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?
[looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know.
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
[laughs] I wish.
Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine
Saw it.
[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!
Beat.
Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!
We're hoping our interview seals the deal.
Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.
You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
Sure, do you have a camera here?
Michael, are you alright?
Well, are you dating anyone?
At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
Thank you.
United front...
Yes.
Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.
Yes, you have very nice teeth.
This is Pam.
It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Oh, I'll just time him later.
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
