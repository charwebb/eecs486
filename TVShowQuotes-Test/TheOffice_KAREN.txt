I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.
If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!

I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?

Let's just get this over with, shall we?
I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.
Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now?
So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
