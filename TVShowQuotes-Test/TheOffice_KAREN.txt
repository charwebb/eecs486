Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]
And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
Hey um, I wanted to talk to you.  I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.
Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir.
But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?
Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam]
So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him?
Let's just get this over with, shall we?
