Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.
So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
And now we get to remember it forever.
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]
Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD]
