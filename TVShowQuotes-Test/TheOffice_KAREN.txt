This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
[squeaky chair] Hey.
He's cute. You should date him.
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
Hey Jan.

It's not good.
Do it.
Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.

You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?
Can I please see you in my office, please?
Mr. Franklin?
OK, OK. Um, cons.
Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.

Jim?
Oh.
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now?
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
Hey.
Thanks. That was fun.

You sure?
Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
Yeah, I'm okay, thanks.
