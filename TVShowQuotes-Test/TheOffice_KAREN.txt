Uh, in about a month.
OK, remember, be strong.

We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.
Oh, come on, guys. Please.
Pam is... kind of a bitch.
[with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty!
That's it? That's what you came up with?
And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
How are we going to get home?
Let's go get a broom.
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
[rocks in squeaky chair]
Just call me when you're done.
Thanks. [looks suspicious]
Yeah, you should not encourage him.
Who's Bob Vance?
Yes. uh, huh.
I so got you.
Mm-hm.
A toaster.
Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Yeah?
stop.
Jim?
Oh.
So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
Can we just get back to work?
I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want.
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
I moved here from Connecticut...
[laughing] Yeah.
