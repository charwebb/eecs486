[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him?
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
Can I please see you in my office, please?
Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
So do you want to see it or not?
It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
Do you want to get back together with her?
I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
