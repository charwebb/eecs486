How often do you come here?
Oh, thank you.
And now we get to remember it forever.
I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
And it didn't end well.
Fifty-one.
[Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]
Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously.
I feel great, Kevin.  Thank you.
What are you doing here?
That's nice.
Yeah, I'm okay, thanks.
Jesus.
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
Uh, what are you doing here?
As well.
I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out.
Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
Good.
Yeah.
Uh, in about a month.
Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]
Got it.
Oh, what happened?
stop.
I moved here from Connecticut...
No.
