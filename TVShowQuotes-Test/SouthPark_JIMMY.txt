She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them. 

Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? 

I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?

So what's the p-plan?

Well, a little, yes.

Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six- 

You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?!  I should k- ick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!

Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.

So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?

I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.

So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work?

Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.

Okay, thahks, Tyler Perry.

Hang on, I'm-I'm, coming. 

He said "at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red"

Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? 

Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-

Well of couse I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say..

Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.

Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!

Hello? Hello? I need to put my ...p-penis in a woman's vagina. Any takers?  Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name?

I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!

What?  Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!

Alright, h-here it goes. On the first day of C-...c...c.. chrih.. stmas my tr... t-tru-true love g-geh... g-g-geh... gave... to... m..m-m-m...m-mm-m-m... me... a pa... a pa... pah...

Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?

Out of Scouts? 

Wow, that's weird.

Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time.

Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!

Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?

I thought you guys said you didn't need school.

It was just a-

So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?

Uh.

Y-yeess! Grrrr!

"If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.

Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?

Yep, b-b-b-bail. 

The Terrance & Phillip mobile game.  All the cool kids are usin' it.

Not this year.

This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.

Come on!

Eight... maids are... milking...

All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.

No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?

Fantastic girls volleyball joke, Stan.

I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?

Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard.

What? Fo-for real?

C-can I just get two back, please?

Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please. 

Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming!  Oh Jesus, not now.  Oh boy, this is embarrassing. 

Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.

Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos

Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!

Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later?  I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim.

But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.

Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.

No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped!
