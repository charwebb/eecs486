That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.

They took it back to the video s... the video s...

Oh, we will. 

What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?

We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!

No, the video suh... the video s...tih...

Sure. I know the p-perfect place.

All righty then.

Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great.  Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what?  And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: 

Come on, push it! Push it!  Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. 

C-can I just get two back, please?

Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet.

She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. 

Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?

Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.

Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.

Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.

Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde.

Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.

This is authentic Italian food straight from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll.

Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fuck ourselves.

Eric, there's something I really need to know.

Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.

What kind of shortcuts?

Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right.  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?  I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.  A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics.  Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say,  "Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- "  "-steroid-taking jackass."  That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor.  '

There you go. Feel better, p-pal? 

Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos

Not this year.

Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.

Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up! 

Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!

Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh! 

Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.

Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done. 

Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? 

S-s-six!

And how about that school counselor? "Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad."  "Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?"  Wow, what a great audience. "Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-"  "Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat"  "I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch."  "Salisbury steak for lunch." Eh. Uh. "Goddamnit, Goddamnit!"  And of course, my very favorite, "Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!"  "Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy." Heh. Sometimes it's like, "Please, Timmy, learn a new word," heh. "Timmy! Tu-Timmy!" 

Oh, I'm sorry.

Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.

You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back

Yeah. S-see ya, Eric. 

Uh.

Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?

A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.

Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman? 

Ni- I can- I can't!  Huff. Oh man.  Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year.  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven ru-reps. Hoh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.

It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.

It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions! 

How much would this cost me?

Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long

But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.

Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?

See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas.

Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more.

I don't know, Timmy, just play along.

Come on.

Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.

Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.

Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
