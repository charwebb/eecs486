Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.

Why sure fellas.  Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.

Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!

Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.

Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief!

Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.

Go!  You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh...  You shall not paah...  You shall not pa--!  You shall not paah--!  You shall not puh-uh-uh--  You shall not pass. 

Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.

Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.

On the fifth... day... day of... Christmas,  ...my t-true love gave to... uh... me. Five g-g-g... golden ruh-ring... rings.  Fuhgom... don... t-t... don... four cal...ling buh-irr

No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! 

To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!

Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?

Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.

Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.

Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?

Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes! 

Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much.

Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. 

I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.  Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh, cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please. 

This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.

Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too.  Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat.  Just for a second, Timmy.  Don't be a jerk, Timmy.  Hey, don't push me!

Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.

Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.

So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?

Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?

Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.

Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter.

Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?

Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.

You can't run away from it forever,  Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow.

But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.

That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.

Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'! 

Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?

Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more.

Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.
