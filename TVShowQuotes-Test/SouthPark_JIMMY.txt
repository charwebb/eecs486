I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.
We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Frances. Hey Frances!
And how about that school counselor? "Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad."  "Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?"  Wow, what a great audience. "Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-"  "Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat"  "I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch."  "Salisbury steak for lunch." Eh. Uh. "Goddamnit, Goddamnit!"  And of course, my very favorite, "Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!"  "Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy." Heh. Sometimes it's like, "Please, Timmy, learn a new word," heh. "Timmy! Tu-Timmy!" 
Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?
Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!
Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!
Ah I don't see a b- b- Bat-Mobile.
Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!
Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?
I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!
Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really my chance to... shine.  Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh...  A guy walks into a guy walks into a  babuh ba-a-a, uh- 
Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.
Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it.
Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.
Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today?
Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary.
Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.
I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.  Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh, cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please. 
Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming!  Oh Jesus, not now.  Oh boy, this is embarrassing. 
Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid.
All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
Alright alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.
Wow, what a great audience.  Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B.  You guys like im- personations? 
Oh Jesus!  You gonna start running your mouth off again?  P-push it! Push it!
That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park. 
Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. 
And so I said to him, "Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf."  Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?
Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much.
Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us.Â 
I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH! 
This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa... the facts!  Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-nununews reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting? 
Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.
Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.
Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much.
