Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong.
Go!  You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh...  You shall not paah...  You shall not pa--!  You shall not paah--!  You shall not puh-uh-uh--  You shall not pass. 
Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!
Yeah.  We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast. 
And the winner is... the Germans!  Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf.  Auf Wiedersehen.  And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is...  Tyler Perry. 
You can't run away from it forever,  Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow.
Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here.  Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?
It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!
Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts.
Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. 
Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.
Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate.
Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips.
Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends.
I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!
There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue.
I needed the money, alright?!  I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!
Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.
Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
Lies! These are all a bunch of lies!  Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!
Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief!
Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition.
The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.
Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us. 
Yeah! Yeah!  Yeah, I did it!  Yeah! Yeah! '
Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!
This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.
I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.
Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?
Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven.
Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?
You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!
Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
Alright, h-here it goes. On the first day of C-...c...c.. chrih.. stmas my tr... t-tru-true love g-geh... g-g-geh... gave... to... m..m-m-m...m-mm-m-m... me... a pa... a pa... pah...
