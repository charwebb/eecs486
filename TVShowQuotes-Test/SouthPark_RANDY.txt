Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!
They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!
I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the "Don't be scared"  and of course there's the-
Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?
We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. 
Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!
And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 
It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. 
The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.
We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
You want me to kick your ass right here?! 
Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!
I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!  Can you help me stop them?!
It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.
Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
"Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."
Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 
Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 
You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 
Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. 
A startup company? A company that does what?
I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. 
Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him.
No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?
The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.
You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.
Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...
No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.
Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.
All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.
Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!
Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers.
It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 
You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.
Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!
I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 
Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 
Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. 
Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.
No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!
Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"?
I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 
Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. 
Don't be a fag!  Come on! We can make it!  We have to try!
Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!
Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.
Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.
It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. 
Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!
Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.
Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...
Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
How much do we have to raise, Mayor?
Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!
I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.
Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!
Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!
Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?
Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. 
I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?
Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...
Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.
It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?
Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.
I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!
Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?
I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!
Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!
I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.
Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!
All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*
...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.
Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.
I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!
There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.
All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!
Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud
Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans.
This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! 
I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.
Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.
When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 
Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.
Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it.
Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 
You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...
