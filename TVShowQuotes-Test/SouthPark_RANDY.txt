Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 
We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.
Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. 
Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.
And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 
Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.
Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!
Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.
Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 
Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 
Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. 
"Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers." Alright.  "Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..."  "slow-growing and can take years to develop." Dammit.  "Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive." Oh this is good. "There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?
I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!
I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 
Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!
No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?
Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.
Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?
Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.
Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!
You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!
Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.
Get back inside. We have work to do. 
You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.
You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?
I know it but I don't think I should say it.
There isn't enough food for more people up here!
Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.
You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!
And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.
A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 
Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
If it means war, then we say NO!
Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power.
Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.
Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!
No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.
Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!
Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.
I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?
Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. 
I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 
Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.
I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.
Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.
Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.
Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right?
No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?
Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.
Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?
There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!
We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. 
Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 
...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!
Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers. 
WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!
Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. 
You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww...
There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?
Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!
Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.
Will he be okay out of the hospital?
The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made." 
Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.
Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!
Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 
Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.
Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. 
Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!
Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...
Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!
Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!
Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.
It is time for us all to grow up.
Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
You kind of seem shitty to me too.
Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
