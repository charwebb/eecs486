Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 

Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.

Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!

Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.

Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am? 

Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. 

I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!

Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.

That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!

Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.

Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.

One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!

Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.

My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!

I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.

And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.

I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.

Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.

Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!

You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! 

Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.

Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?

Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?

Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!

It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?

Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.

It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 

I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.

Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.

I worked all day! I can watch what I want!

Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.

Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.

Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!

Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! 

Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers. 

Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?

Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs.

I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 

And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?

Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?

Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!

And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 

No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!

"Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers." Alright.  "Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..."  "slow-growing and can take years to develop." Dammit.  "Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive." Oh this is good. "There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?

Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!

Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.

Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.

Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.

Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!

Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!

What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!

Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 

No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?

Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!

Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." 

HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!

Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.

Is it really as bad as they say it is?

Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.

No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!

Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? 

Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,

On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 

Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.

I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!

Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!

Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!

That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.

Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.

But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.

You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!

Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! 

You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!

I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?

If it means war, then we say NO!

No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.

I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.

Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.

All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.

Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!

I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me.

Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?

Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! 

Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?

Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.

Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 

All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. 

Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?

Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 

Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.

Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?

Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.

You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.

Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.

That's great. So can I get a referral from you?

That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 

But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. 

Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 

Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!

What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?

Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?

Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?

That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.

We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.

How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.

Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!

Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home.

Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.

I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.

Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 

Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.

Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 

Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.

I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!

"He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this- 

Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!

Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?

Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.

I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!

I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?

Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!

Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.

Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.

Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.

You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?

Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.

Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?

Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.

Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.

You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?

Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?

You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!

We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!

How long do I have to stay here?!

All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.

Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!

Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. 

Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...

Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.

It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.
