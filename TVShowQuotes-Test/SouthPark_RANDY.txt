Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.
Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 
This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!
More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 
What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.
What does that have to do with anything? 
I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.
Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 
Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.
This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.
No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 
Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. 
Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 
Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!
HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 
Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.
What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. 
Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.
It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  "Hello."  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 
Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 
Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself! 
I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.
Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 
Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 
Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit?  Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-Shu-Sharon? 
GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!
That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?
That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 
Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 
Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
How long do I have to stay here?!
Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!
Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! 
All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 
Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 
...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.
There isn't enough food for more people up here!
It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 
That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 
You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!
Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!
There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 
Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 
Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!
I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 
Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home.
You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-
Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 
Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! 
Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. 
I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today.
