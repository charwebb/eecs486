Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.
We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am? 
SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! 
We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.
Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 
I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. 
Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?
I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!  Can you help me stop them?!
And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 
Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 
Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! 
Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 
All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.
Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. 
They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?
Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.
Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. 
Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.
Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. 
An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"
Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?
Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers. 
We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?
I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.  All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. Whew, that was hard.
Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!
Is it really as bad as they say it is?
Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 
Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.
O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 
All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. 
Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 
Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 
Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.
Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.
Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. 
Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!
Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?
Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!
Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. 
We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!
You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place.
Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 
I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!
Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!
That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!
Get back inside. We have work to do. 
I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?
Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever.
Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 
Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!
Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.
We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.
Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!
You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 
No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. 
Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?
Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.
You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?
We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
