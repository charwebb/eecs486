Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.

Nn-Oh my God! 

Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?

No.

Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.

I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.

Oh, God-damnit!

Where?!

Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.

You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?

No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 

Oh, my head.

Aaah I don't know. Why?

That's my boy.

Eh, it's fine with me.

Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! 

No, no, no, it's not on.

STAN?! Stan! 

Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. 

I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.

Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?

AAAAA!  AAAAA! 

And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"?

Puh, punching trees?

Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.

Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.

Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 

This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! 

Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. 

That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.

Yeah.

Harrrh!

Well, let's all get going.

Hey, Mr. Allens.

Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley.

Uh... NO I mean...  I like it.

Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!

I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.

Ohh! Ohh! Duuude! 

What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!

Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  "Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."  Stan?

They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!

Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 

Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!

Well, maybe it's time.

Back from where?

How do you know?!

You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.

Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?

I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.

Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.

I know it but I don't think I should say it.

What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?

AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!

Yes ah, I'm getting it now.

Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.

Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Great, thanks.  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.

Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!

He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. 

Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.

That's my son, you bastard!

No, sorry, I don't have any change.

Helllo?

What the hell is that supposed to mean?!

You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!

You know so little! 

No, Dad.

Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?

OH! Ohoho, you bitch!  Ohohunh.

...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!

Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." 

The video sandwich?

I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.

Do what??

He's homeless now. We aren't safe.

Ahhh...

It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!

There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?

Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. 

So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? 

Oh Glen! We made it!

Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?

Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 

Yes.

...I'm not a r-tard. 

We're working on it! 

Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.

Obama's not talkin' about you!

Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 

Gotta get out!

Will he be okay out of the hospital?

You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.

What the hell is that?  Who put that there?

ManBearPig?

Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.

Nyugh!

Okay.

HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!

That's it, I'm leaving! 

Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.

Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!

Hey, see you Nelson.

Yes?

Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 

It's working!

Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?

Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.

Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.

There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.

Okay, problem solved.

Well, hello, ladies.

Sharon, what are the boys doing?

Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.

I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.

What?  Hey, hey Sharon.

Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.

Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?

Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.

How. You won't have Internet. 

I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?

Yeah! 

Will do, officer. Will... do... 

I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!

Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold

For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. 

Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am? 

Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.

Oh, is that so?

I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?

Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!

Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...

It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 

What is it?

Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!

Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!

What?!

It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.

He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.

I'm 19.

See ya. 

Help! Help us!

All right, what the hell is going on here?!

They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!

Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. 

Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.

No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.

People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 

That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.

Come on, hurry! 

It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. 

Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. 

Read what?

Huh.  That's weird.

Did you turn the heat down?

Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!

Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?

Raaaawr! 

....Yeeeah.

Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?

Aww crap!  Here, hold this! 

FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!

I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.

Here's their van! Here's their van!

We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.

"Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"  "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man.

Stan I... need your help.

I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.

She's such a train wreck!

Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!

Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.

No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!

You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! 

How about twenty?

Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!

Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!

Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!

And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important.

And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH! 

Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!

Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 

Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?

Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!

Oh, I see. So when does the game start?

Fort Collins can't play!

Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.

Y-Yes, absolutely.

Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!

Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!

We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 

Hi Carol.

I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.

What is it?

Don't be a fag!  Come on! We can make it!  We have to try!

Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.

Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 

Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!

See?

Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.

You know we're all cutting down on phone time.

My God...

Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?

Stan?

You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?

No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?

Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?

Oh, finally! 

Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.

Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.

Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-

That's completely different!

Face it, we're gonna starve!

Whaa-wha-what about it

What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?

How's your mom? Your, your sister?

Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!

Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!

Yeah, with our own eyes.

Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.

Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-

Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.

Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, 

Yes?

One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!

What?! 

Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?

Aw yeah?

Shipped. He said "shipped".

You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.

It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.

Stan, we- 

Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?

No... Nooo...

Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 

What's goin' on?

Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff. 

Thanks Jim. 

Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. 

Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!

Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.

Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?

Right, Starbucks!

Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?

We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!

Look at it, honey. It's so big.

God, the whole neighborhood's affected.
