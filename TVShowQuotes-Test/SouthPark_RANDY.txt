How's your... mother?

Hello?  Hey, come out of there!

You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 

So what happened?

My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. 

Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?!

Hellooo family!  Who wants champagne? 

Right.

Stan! 

Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.

Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?!

Who who did you hear is, is gay?!

Huh?

Sta-ogh. Ugh! 

Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!

Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!

Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!

What?

Oooooo.

I am not chugging beer!  I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! 

HAAA! 

Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!

What's goin' on?

We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.

Aw, suck it! All o'ya!

Where is Stan?

...Right, right right.

Can I, can I see it?

You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!

We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.

Hey, really??

Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!

No it doesn't.

Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.

Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. 

Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!

On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 

No, Dad, she's dead!

Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. 

Oh my God.

See ya. 

Now your vote didn't matter.

Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.

Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?

Damn it! How come you're not combusting? 

Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me.

Quiet on set, please.

Stan...

Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! 

Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.

Stan... 

Huh?

Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-

It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.

Yeah?

What?

It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! 

Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan!  Stan! 

I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 

We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.

Will you relax, Stan? 

Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?

Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!

I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!

But, w-we're still selling records, right?

Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?

There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?

How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!

That's better.

Yes, Freemium gaming.

Shipped. He said "shipped".

So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? 

What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?

NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!

Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.

Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! "Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom." Oh, we need this! 

It's, it's working!

Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!

I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!

Oh my Gohhhd!

Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.

Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?

Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.

Four point four inches...

Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 

I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.

ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.

I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 

I love you too babe.  OH!

I'm the... only scientist in town.

No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!

You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.

What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!

You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.

Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!

How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?

Oh, brother. 

Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?

You want me to kick your ass right here?! 

I worked all day! I can watch what I want!

Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?

I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry.

Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!

Aw crap!

Oh dammit!

I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.

What brah?!

Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!

Uh, look, Mr....

We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.

Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?

Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?

Is it really as bad as they say it is?

Hey guys, Finland's dead.

The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.

Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.

What?!

Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.

Yeah!

What? I thought this was a free country! 

Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.

No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.

Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.

All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!

OKAY?!

Oh, do we have to do it right now?

They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance.

She's too young for that stuff!

I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.

You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!

No! That is not the way we're remembering it!

Take the shot!! Take the shot!!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!

Oh. You. You don't?

Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. 

WAAAH!

Okay. What's Shelly doing?

Thank you Gerald. 

Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!

Gotta get out!

AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?!

Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?

Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??

That's our Grandpa. 

Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!

Oh, God-damnit!

Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. 

Uh, look, I just want to tell you that

Are you crazy?

No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.

I respect you, bro!

Ogh, I already did.

Get inside! We have to close these doors! 

Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 

We're going back to the pile.

Get back inside. We have work to do. 

Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!

Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. 

Wow. 

Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?

A ladder to heaven? Why, son?

Stan I... need your help.

Right here, brah! 

Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?

We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.

Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.

I know, right?

See ya, Mr. Grazier. 

Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...

Well... so... they don't really... do anything.

Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!

Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 

Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 

...Yeah. I do.

Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.

No! 

...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?

Well I think that there's a uh...

Not much, sup with you guys?

Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel! 

And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. 

You won't make it through, Gerald! 

I'm a geologist! 

Well, let's all get going.

Wull come on, that's impossible!

In my jeans?

Oh yeah, good one! 

Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. 

Jesus, it's statewide.

Back from where?

There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?

Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 

Mine... mine was bigger.

Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?

But... But this is real.

Yes Dad.

Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.

But then, does it still count?

A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 

Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!

Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!

No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 

Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.

Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.

Honey! Honey, come quick!

Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!

What the hell is that supposed to mean?!

Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.

We're working on it! 

RUN! 

Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.

How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.

Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. 

Hi. Corey Lanskin?

Y-Yes, absolutely.

We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?

Stan??

What? What did I do?!  What did I do?!

I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.

You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!

Oh my God.

It wasn't bigger than mine was.

Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.

Good call, ref! Good call!

Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!

Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.

Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?

It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!

Stan!

Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?

But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.

Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-

No.

Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter!

Helllo?

Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!

My God, you're right.

You really did a nice job, Eric. 

Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!

Who is it, Sharon?

Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. 

Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!

Whaa-wha-what about it

I would need a lot of help.

Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!

Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.

Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands.
