O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 
Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 
Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 
Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! 
I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.
Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 
On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 
Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?
Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit! 
Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-
I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.
Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?
Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.
Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!
Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!
I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 
Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?
You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!
HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!
Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.
Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.
Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel! 
What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! 
There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!
No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the "nigger" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on "Wheel of Fortune", you know and... and when people call me... "nigger guy"... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 
Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 
It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. 
No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!
Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.
There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?
Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.
That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 
OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.
No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.
So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! 
Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! 
It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
How do we get our runaway children back?
Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him.
Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!
I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. 
If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. 
According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. 
Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!
Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.
The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-
It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys.
And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.
I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. 
And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 
"He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this- 
Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 
Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!
Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.
Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!
It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.
Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! 
Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 
You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.
I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me.
I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 
Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 
The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. 
Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?
Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.
Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. 
Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.
Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. 
Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.
Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?
Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?
Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?
Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.
If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 
Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 
Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. 
Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. 
...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!
We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. 
Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?! 
Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!
We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 
Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.
There isn't enough food for more people up here!
Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!
Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
