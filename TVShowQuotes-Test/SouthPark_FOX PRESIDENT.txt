You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!!  How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!
I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.
