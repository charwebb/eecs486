We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?
If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.
Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
[to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out...  [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
[Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!
Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I���m happy Angela���s the first one getting famous, but it���s a little weird, no? I mean, she can���t sing or act, so it���s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.
[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
[in a cockney accent] I think he's got it!
Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
Spring sing ���95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?
[as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y...
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years���.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.
Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?
[dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight���s meeting.
Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You're the best ever!
[in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.
No, that���s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about���
That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!
[voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that���s good because I was basically wrong.  I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it���s really more like they���re just people who work in an office and I���m their manager.  Yeah that���s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys.
Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]
Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in.
Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]
Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin]
Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.
This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You're gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee���
All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.
Well, it���s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.
You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.
No I didn���t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.
What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.
[muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,
You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,' I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me.' And the shop girl goes, 'ok'. And Julia Roberts goes,' You girls work on commission, right?' And the girl is like,'Yeah', and Julia Roberts goes...
[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
[after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.
I don���t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, ���Red Alert.���
Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]
[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
[to Dwight, Stanley, and Phyllis]: Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it���s really stupid, but it���s also really, really, really important.
Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
It's me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama.
Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like ���Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas��� Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.
Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
And you know what?  The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.
Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
[puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering]
Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]
Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn't matter what Pam looks like.
Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, 'Don't Just Dream it, do it.' Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure's Crazy Train]
All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.
[scoffs] Pfft.  You don't teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  [Opens door, Andy's brother is passed out inside] Walt?
Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my 'Lost' on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
[Jo's dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs...
No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,
[tries to break club over knee] Ow! Ow! [tries again] Owooh!
Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience.  So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna...
Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.
Yeah and we���re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you���d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.
If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.
I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]
Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation.
You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...
Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?
I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
It is the source of all energy on this planet.
[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]
One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!
Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.
This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al']
OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.
Ok.  Erin I think you know I���ve been dating someone.
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.
There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.
Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.
But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
No I didn���t want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it���s weird that she���s not calling.
[Happily] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
Mm, then I will make up a cause.
But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...
Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.
Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.
It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.
Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.
Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you���re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! [group takes pictures] Ah OK, now a serious one.
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
[leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]
I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.
Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
It's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.
Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
[approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard.
Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?
How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.'
Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
[singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
[forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-
Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh...
