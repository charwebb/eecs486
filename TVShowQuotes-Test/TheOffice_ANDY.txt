You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man���s signature solo is his for life, okay? That���s group policy and you know it.
My new girlfriend.
Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.
A-team.
How do you not have a toothbrush?
A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
That brilliant little bitch.
No, I-
You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ��I stepped in and I didn���t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, ���Where were you when the girls came?���
[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
It is? I'm sorry.
Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
Alright everybody, you are doing great!
Are you saying-
No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
How'd it look?
Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.''
Dwight why don���t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
I can't hear you through the glass
[in robot voice] What is going on?
[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.
Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
Atta boy Clark!
Oh, he's out there.
Thank you, Erin.
Hey.
Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they���re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it���s a little much? ���Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that���s what it feels like.
17 B.C.
It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?
Okay.
Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
Guys! Guys! Guys!
Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
Michael
You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.
Yes bosses.
I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.
She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.
You were saying you chose me���. There was a reason?
Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
Oooohhh.
They had, uh��� weapons.
Ay-o!
Not helping, tuna.
A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy?
You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
I miss her too.
It's my ear.
I have a delicious secret.
Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.
Are we rotating seats, or?
I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
That is just obnoxious.
I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
I bought these.
Here���s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam���
Thank you.
Yeah, I know. Neiche!
We could write a strong-worded letter.
Well that's not what we agreed on.
Sha-bow.
Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
We promised we���d never say goodbye.
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
What is it, Big Haircut?
In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.
Let me get a picture of you guys.
Well it's the thought that counts.
Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
But I don't think it's a disaster.  I think it's fun, and I like the food.
Um, what are we talking price wise?
Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.
Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.
Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.
Are they on their way over?
Hey boss. Got a minute?
Erin!
No! No! No!
I���m sorry ��� I���m with a very important client. It���ll have to wait.
I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
Close it. [starts wrestling Dwight]
Alright, a plan it is.
Awesome. [to Pete] Plop!
Dwight?
We kinda nailed it.
Hi.
[answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
Yes.
Hey. What's up?
Why would that make me a pervert, I -
Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.
[whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
Yeah.
Thank you, I appreciate that. ���Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
Thank you. Yeah,
Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]
Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]
We're gonna do it outside.
I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
Hey! Tuna! He's back.
Hmm.
Do you think... [bottle rolling] so you think... [bottle rolling, clanking]
Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
Love the belt.
[drumroll with hands] I��� it���s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice���s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ���I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.��� Smart, right?
What?!
You don���t have any-- Any questions about the old days? [clears throat] You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
You sure it's saber?
Ow.
Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys.
No one expects me to go through with this, right?
Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
[singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
Good, good. What else?
No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
Bring it on guys.
So we're just, like, jamming as friends?
Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.
Sorry.
Wet Tuna!
Don���t touch me.
Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
[scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.
You hadn't noticed she's a woman?
[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!
Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
Really?
Yeah, Dwight.
No way, lady.
[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful.
[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!
Stanley, you're suppose to close.
Come on!
Good!
[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
What's going on?
Well, you do actually.  You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.
Roller derby practice!
[on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.
[on phone] Hello.
Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
Everyone else is too drunk.  Just don't let me die here.
You're asking him to give up all of his power.
I'm...  I'm asking you out.
What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.
I think we���ve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.
Shut up, Broccoli.
I don't think so.
[confused] Yeah.
Maybe we have a plan for you?
You didn't have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]
Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk]
Say it.
And it���s getting a little more serious.  She���s never come by.
Well-
Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]
Uh... [laughs sheepishly]
I am the captain.
And- oh. You missed your head. [laughs and puts hat on Jim's head] There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.
Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
For four more days.
I, I thought that you would like it.
The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
Really?  That doesn't sound right.
The fire's shooting at us!
You all made it, thank you so much.
I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
Mmmm...
How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It���s cause I had a fallback. That���s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it���s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You're gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
Definition.
Did she have any last words or?
Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right!
You can't. You can't.
So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
Yeah. You don't have to ask me.
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'
Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just...
Okay, all right, all right, all right.
Count to twen - count to twenty.
That you're sleeping with Dwight.
Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.
Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
Hello.
No!
These cookies are fine.
I���m delivering it from the fridge. It���s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
Don���t care. Tell me later.
Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly]
Isn't that part of the fun?
Not guy friends?
Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]
Woo-hoo.
No I���m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn���t, I���m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don���t like to throw around the b-word, but I���m going to be a huge bitch to you.
Have you lost weight?
One, two, three, go!
Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause������
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
Nah, no. We'll be back before that.
Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
What?
Maybe we could switch instruments.
TUNA! Are you kidding me!!
No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
Sure.
Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.
[vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!
... not what I meant.
Whoa, fire!
Einsteins! Great work.
Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.
I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
It's just a garden party. Sheesh.
Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.
[looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
B-9.
Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
Few other super simple reminders ��� no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
Maybe you're in the ceiling!
Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain]
Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.
I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
Ryan, why didn't you tell me?
Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
I will! I will take all of those dogs!
Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.
Last year, I went to a seminar called 'The Ten Secrets of Real Estate'. Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass.
Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
[Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
It's not that, exactly.
Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Yeah, it's a kilt.
I would agree with that.
I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
So... here's the thing about infidelity.
Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.
Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
If the shoe fits. [plays g��iro and sings, Kevin echoes]
Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.
Hey, Jim.
Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar]
[gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this.
All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
Did you mean a real date?
I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.
I know, right?
That's not what I had in mind.
What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
I'm her fiance.
Oh. Okay.
Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.
What about a cat eating man food?
Ah! That���s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]
This is what I was trying to tell you.
Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!
Just serve.  Let's go. [hits one into net]  Dammit!  These balls are weighted weird, aren't they?
Your text said 911.
One. Two. Three. Shot!
Yes.
I mean... I'm impressed.
[eyewashes again] AHH! AHH! AHH!
Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
Exactly.
Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.
Take care Julia.
This conversation is over.
Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
You sure?
It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
I'm like a quarter of the way through.
[sings] What is love?
Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
Hey Kevin.
[imitating car noises] Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!
OK great.
Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!
Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
Just make up a phone call. It���s not a real call. Make it up.
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.
Kevin, I appreciate what you���re trying to do.
That's as hard as I can hint.
...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
Who is ready for dinner? 'oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid'. No. [claps] I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves��� [takes foil off tray] [Jamaican accent] A Jamaican feast, mon!
Can you go over those options again?
Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
[slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
Thank you, David.
I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
Do you know why you never heard of it?
I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties���and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?
Ohh...
[wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys.
Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.
[laughing at something on his computer]
OK, fine, yeah. that���s one guy���s opinion!
I don't normally do this, but...
What do you mean, take my job?
Yeah.
You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born.
Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
Rude. And not helpful.
I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Yikes!
Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words ���HARD ASS���] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
Hi.
Hey!
What's up, man?
We're taking a picture.
Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind.
Actor?
Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
Hey, any fun weekend plans?
Yeah, yeah.
These are delicious.
All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]
[drinks hand soap]
This has been a really tough time.
I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner.
[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?
This kid's costing us sales, Michael.
Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
[hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.
Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent���s putting me up for a furniture commercial.
I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.
Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
Oscar, it's not that hot out.
Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
That's actually 'Master of Ceremonies' Bernard.
Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
We'll use code names.
I'm gonna lose 'em.
On it!
[coughs word] Idiot!
Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]
I can���t.
Kevin, you open it up.
Hour forty-five.
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
No, I don���t have AIDS. That���s not what I said. Next question.
Dwight?
Hmm? Who? Sam?
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam's tummy]
[lying on table] Do your worst!
Oh, K. It's only three weeks.
