Totally... not. [Erin gets up and walks away]
Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
Excuse me.
Yeah?
And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
[almost running into Erin] Whoa-oh, traffic jam!
No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What's that?
Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
Stock market.
Dwight?
Thank you.
Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Whoa!
Carla! Carla!
Where are we in the process?
Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!
Yeah, sell.
Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.
Uh, this has got to stop.
Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.
Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.
Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
Oh, my God!
I'm telling you to back down.
Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.
No where near the big rock.
Tuna dog!
[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
It is the source of all energy on this planet.
And a top of the day to you too, sir.
Michael
I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
Nice!
Oh my God!
I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
[waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!
I don't care, that's how much I swear!
All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.
Good morning.
If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
Thank you very much.  Now I've got it for you. [holds open door]
No. Because they all left.
Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys.
Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.
You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here.
Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
All right, everybody's still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.  [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs]
Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]
Alright, you got it.
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said ���You can't be a skipper until you're a man.��� You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance.
They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'
Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
I���m not going to take it. And then he���s going to be like ���whoa this is a really important meeting���.
[to Erin] You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
Hand me that water.  I always say 'Beer me.'  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how's what's-her-name?
Maybe it's just more like, 'be mine.'
That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.
That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
Little raw. Not cool Oscar.
Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.
Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight���s meeting.
Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!
Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.
Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!
What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
You're asking him to give up all of his power.
Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.
Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!
[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.
No.
Oh, he's out there.
Wait. Seriously?
Divorced?
Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
There���s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales���
Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now.
I don't know. [chuckles]
No kidding?
I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And he's delightful! [laughs]
Can you do it?
Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?
Thanks, Oscar.
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years���.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.
[smiles] It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you���re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges��� reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly���
What?
Yeah, ok.
Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.
[Happily] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
So Darryl says to me ���fire me���. But what he really means is ���I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.��� So I say ���No, you're not fired.��� But what I really mean is ���I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.���........I really hope that's what he and I mean.
Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
I'm your wingman.
Pam! Come on!
I think he can hear us.
For happy hour?
Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
What the heck was that?
I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.
No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.
This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!
Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.
I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
Which is like, 'Right on.' And Pam was like 'blah blah blah' and you were like 'Yeah, psht.' Nailed it.
Rude. And not helpful.
Woo-hoo.
That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.
Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.
Boo-yea! [office laughs]
[falsetto] I'll be your croak madame.
Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.
Mmmm.. suck-ah!
Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words---
[on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?
Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.
We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.
[on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That���s what I call the sun now.
You'll thank me when they spank thee.
Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.
For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you���re Boner Champ.
Well, that went pretty well.
Dwight?
It could totally work though. I don���t know why we wouldn���t. Oh my god are we doing this?
The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?
The temp at night?
OK, fine, yeah. that���s one guy���s opinion!
You all made it, thank you so much.
No, I'm just testing if he can hear.
Of course. I own my toothbrush.
Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? [starts singing to the tune of Feist's 1234] One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather...
And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.
Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
Pizza rolls.
Good-bye, Lackawana County.
Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.
I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God!
I mean, it's distant, but...
Yeah, I guess.
[wipes nose] Sorry.
Why don���t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I���m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I���m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they���re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you���re in the good old days before you���ve actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.
[pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?
It's me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama.
Get excited!
Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
Dijonnaise.
You can't dock my pay-
Awesome.
Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?
Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.
Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]
Alright everybody, you are doing great!
Val, I need the space.
Awesome. [to Pete] Plop!
Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.
Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
Just need a second outside.
I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
Yes bosses.
Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
And you didn't invite any of us?
It's John Gotti, you idiot!
Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.
Hmm... mm, what's that smell?
Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
We lost the account.
Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
[grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll.
Just do it.
A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
That���s���that���s what���yeah. Okay, all right, well, here���s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga���s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater���
Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.'
Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
Yeah, fine.
I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.
No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
[to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out...  [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
No! No! No!
Saying I love... Saying I love you...
Seems like...
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
[to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays 'Rockin' Robin']
[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... [sighs] No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
It���s a photocopy from your notebook.
You know what, I didn't try those. [reaches for one] I could try this.  Augh!  Fried Twinkies, you kidding me?  Starting to wonder about the food in this place [takes a bite].  Oh, God!  That is so good.
Nobody wants ...that, to happen.
That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.
Which combo do you think Robert's gonna like better?
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
Hey, Kev.
Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-
I should make you my vichyssoise.
God, Toby, don���t���stop blocking my hand.
If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
No.
Great group! Pizza party!
Excuse me.
You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
Hey Dwight, I bet I can stack faster than you can.
[Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and... acting on that thing.
Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.
Are you volunteering?
I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
Did you see who did it?
So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?
Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out]
Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.
Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.
I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.
[cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
I���ll explore exploring it.
Yes, a madhouse.
Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak. [Michael laughs]
Doesn���t mean you���re the best singer ever. Dick.
Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.
Let me think about it--
Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.
Make it higher? Okay.
[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.
I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
I'm pretty good at board games.
[gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this.
Yeah, I know.
Women friends?
Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.
OK!
Pull the poop out of the toilets.
Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?
Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.
That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.
No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
[cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home!
I got it, try, um--[Coughs]
...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
250
Um, I do, 'cause I just told you.
I said no hits!
Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?
It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....
Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.
No.
I can't tell if he's mocking me.
Sure, I um..I didn't know.
Gotta get my goin' out on.
That's insane!
I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'
That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.
Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who���s next? Darryl?
What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?
Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ��I stepped in and I didn���t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, ���Where were you when the girls came?���
Dave Matthews.
You wanted to see me?
I have needs.
Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...
Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, 'in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.' [laughs]
Feel ya, dawg.
May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]
No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.
They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
Where?
Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
Yeah...
Oh D.
People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen 'An Inconvenient Truth'. Nearly twice.
Clean the toilets.
No.
Why not, dawg?
[pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don't know. Mmhmm.
Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?
You guys...
[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]
Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws.
New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
Baseball! Go talk to him.
Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ��I just feel good!
Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.
Well, that...really bums me out.
My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
Umm... I'm number three.
Aah! This ones hot too!
What���s the mouse���s name?
No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.
Tell me about it, you know? I���ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don���t know if I���m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?
Those aren't straight. Totally crooked. Totally crooked. You're disqualified.
It���s okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?
All right. Formative years. [She laughs]
Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
Say what?
Alright.
Andy have a boo-boo tummy.
Yeah. You don't have to ask me.
Oooooo, saucy.
Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what we���re talking about is���basically the speech equivalent��� to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need use���but need need for talk talk.
Pi...
Duh.
Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
Ay-o!
I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn���t help.
Why? Everybody's heard it.
Would you rather me say 'Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?'
Are you ready?
Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
This drink... [in audible conversation with Michael]
Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?
Yeah.
Then forget I just told you that.
Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. [laughs] Well, yeah, whatever. So. [walks away]
Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
Hey good lookin', what ya got cookin'?
You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.
Yes!
What do you mean?
Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk]
Yeah it does.
Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.
And let me just add, that as a member of The Finer Things Club, I would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have.  Finally, here is a recommendation from former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.
If the shoe fits. [plays g��iro and sings, Kevin echoes]
Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!
Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
Yeah, yeah.
Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?
Trust me it would only make you mad.  [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]
I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
What?
Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.
One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.
Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
I'm willing to pay you.
No way!
How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
Why does Erin like Gabe?
Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
[playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]
Trying to get a head count.
OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,
[still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!
Right? Rough scene.
Isn't that part of the fun?
Oh!
But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh!
[high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation.
I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
That's it!
No.  I will not be playing it 'cool' [makes air quotes] with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing].  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here's the kicker.  That school?  Cornell.
They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture���
We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.
Thanks T-Dog.
