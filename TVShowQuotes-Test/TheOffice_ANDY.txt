Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I���ll tell you how we can beat it.
Yeah, so, I���ll see you on the red carpet. See, that���s how it works.
This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.
Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?
Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?
Whoa!  What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh...
I don���t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, ���Red Alert.���
Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.
Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation���s Lisa Loeb.
Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
[in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]
Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
From total loss to total boss, I mean-
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby���s thighs]
So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.
Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words---
What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!
Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.
Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
Why would that make me a pervert, I -
[still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!
Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: ���You guys are killing it!��� I mean, we're internet sensations guys!
You're four seasons in a day. [heaves] You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue... [stops, is struggling] It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.
She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply]
No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.
We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.
I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor���.vanilla?
I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch.
Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.
Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
It was before, my tech- my technical training.
Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]
[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
Let me get a picture of you guys.
Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my 'knot' on.
At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.
Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!
[singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.
But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...
Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.
Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.
Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.
[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'
Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.
Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?
You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.
Oh, okay. I don���t want any part of this.
I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
[Happily] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen 'An Inconvenient Truth'. Nearly twice.
Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?
Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?
As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.
Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.
If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage]
There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]
We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.
It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
[to Dwight, Stanley, and Phyllis]: Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?
Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.
Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
You give me a gift-- Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor-- Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.
[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.
Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.
All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?
I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
[looking at Cece, under his breath] Ah, man. [looks at Erin talking to Gabe]
Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it.
Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?
They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'
Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..[Group protests]
Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.
You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in]
The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be���[ringtone of Dixie plays].  Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ���Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes��� by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith���African American���Mambazo.
I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!
Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
Get in here. [Andy and Erin go into photo booth] Where did you learn to talk like that?
[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!
Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.
Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. [laughs] Well, yeah, whatever. So. [walks away]
Whoa! And he just goes, 'Boom'. [kicking motion] Goal!
What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?
[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.
But I don't think it's a disaster.  I think it's fun, and I like the food.
I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.
Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you���re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
[grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That���s final.
You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man���s signature solo is his for life, okay? That���s group policy and you know it.
Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.
[lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who's there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.'
Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up.
Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!
Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
When I was a salesman I could just be like ���Not my job, not my prob. I���m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.��� Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.
Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there.
Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
Why don���t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
He���ll know that we looked at his private notebook.
OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy..
It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. [to Darryl] Good. Great job.
Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You're doing great, by the way.
Didn���t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
Eleanor Roosevelt once said ���the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.��� [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she���s right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I���m doing the right thing.
You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
What is goin' on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]
You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet.
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.
Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
I'm talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?
Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
[Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I'll be first in line.  Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.  If you need me let me know, gonna be around.  If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down.  If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.  Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try.  Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela.  Take a chance on me.
I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]
Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
I use the word ���guys��� a lot when I'm nervous...guys.
Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-
Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic]
That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?
In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-
[Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
[knocking] Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute?
Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! [group takes pictures] Ah OK, now a serious one.
Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ���er rip. What do you hate about this place?
Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.
We had to leave because of creative differences.
[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
[smiles] It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
[after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh?
You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?
No, we were really making out in the woods.
That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it���s not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it.
[has two tissues in his nostrils] It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?
[Group continues chanting ���Fail!���]That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. [Group keeps chanting] You're all failing right now. [Group continues] Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! [Group claps and chants]
Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that���s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
Mm, then I will make up a cause.
My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years���.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.
Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table.
