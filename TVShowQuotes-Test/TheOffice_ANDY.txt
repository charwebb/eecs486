Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so...  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.
I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up.
So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.
Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause������
My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal���s going out on.
Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?
People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my 'knot' on.
What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.
Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  [Opens door, Andy's brother is passed out inside] Walt?
That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!
White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.
I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture���
Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?
Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.'
Got it. [lowers head to show hair, but keeps looking up just as she tries to take the picture]
Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
Tell me about it, you know? I���ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don���t know if I���m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes.
Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]
So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.
[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. 'Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?'
This is what I was trying to tell you.
Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from Nelly] Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.
My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There's just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.
I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
[singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said ���You can't be a skipper until you're a man.��� You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance.
Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
Yeah, but��� My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.
[in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]
Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk]
[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!
Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.
Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so.
Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'
I don't want to talk about work right now.
[singing] Saying I love you is not the words...
Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.
[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.
Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I���m gonna stay on in sales.
When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I'm manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.
[Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow! [yelling all around the office]
So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?
I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.
Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.
[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
Well, why don���t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.
It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.
You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!
OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?
I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse.
Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
[trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]
All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?
Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
[excited] That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.
You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?
It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]
Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]
I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
Mm, then I will make up a cause.
What���s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
Can't argue with that. Dwight ... [takes Angela's hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other]
How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I've never even used an eye dropper.
Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.
[on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ���95. Hey there, um, I���m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question.  I may be missing a chapter here���De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale���uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I���m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs]
[whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert���man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how���s the sales doubling ���project going?
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy?
I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.
[miffed] Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?
[Australian accent] Well, what can���t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn���t noticed, I���ve got a pretty good British accent.
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
[from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You're clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
Not my slaves, my ancestors���. Maybe. Probably not.
You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
[snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
No, no, no, no, no, we don���t need to call the police. They���ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone���s business, right, Pam?
All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years���.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.
So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper]
I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.
Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs]
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
[confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin's in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady...
Spring sing ���95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.
No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight���s meeting.
I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
Which is like, 'Right on.' And Pam was like 'blah blah blah' and you were like 'Yeah, psht.' Nailed it.
I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him!
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
I left my cell phone in my car.
Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he���s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he���s hard to love, but did you know that he���s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
Hey guys!  Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!
No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.
[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.
Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
He���ll know that we looked at his private notebook.
Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar]
There���s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.
Doesn���t mean you���re the best singer ever. Dick.
If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I���m happy Angela���s the first one getting famous, but it���s a little weird, no? I mean, she can���t sing or act, so it���s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that���s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.
Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin's car]
Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!
We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we���re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
[in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.
I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
I'm the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales:  Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.
[on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... [covers phone] I'm making a sale. Sales.
At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.
You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.
No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that.
[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
If the shoe fits. [plays g��iro and sings, Kevin echoes]
Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
So she looks at me right, and she goes, 'I'm sorry, don't I even know you?' After a year, a
