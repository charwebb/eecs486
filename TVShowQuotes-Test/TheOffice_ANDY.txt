Water.
But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.
Step 1, disinfection.  Step 2, incision.  Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn't burst and spread toxic...icity everywhere.
Dwight!
Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too���
Yeah, but I'm number three.
[looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
You my friend are in a very close second.
You?
Just, you sure Clark?
What can I do for ya Hoss?
Oh, yeah, I was just tired.
I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There���s a review of the documentary!
This dance competition is not over.
The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
Oh, my God!
That���s how I got my new job in the admissions office.
Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..[Group protests]
So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.
Angela, you like lacrosse?
Well now hold on it, it-
I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you���re Boner Champ.
Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we���re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her.
You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. [begins raising sail, boat guy slaps his hand]
Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
Okay.  Let's do it.
Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here.
All right, everybody's still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.  [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs]
Uh yeah, look at that.
I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys! [dances along to the drumming]
How are my sales doin'?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy.  You're not buying it, you're good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.
Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it.
I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.
Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it.
Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.
Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
I'm not crying I'm just sweating.
Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?
Oh, we got this!
Sure thing, buddy.
You never told me you were in high-school!
It, it's, it's actually just an issue...
[trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]
Swear to God, hope to die. Now let���s get to work!
I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
What do you got?
Umpf���that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
Ryan, why didn't you tell me?
[signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.
And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat.
Pull the poop out of the toilets.
[excited] That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
You do have a fantastic basement.
Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I'm going to do this.
Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
And come and tell me. Doesn���t matter what it is.
That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.
Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...
Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.
So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.
Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God!
[wipes nose] Sorry.
When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.
Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
That's the family boat!
Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut?
[laughing at something on his computer]
Well that's not what we agreed on.
Dude, you struck out.  They're totally stuck up.  Here... drink up.
They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
I know who did this....Dwight.
It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.
[to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out...  [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting]
I did stand up comedy once.
Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
[entering annex] Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?
Saboteur!
I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Who'd you get?
He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?
Coolio.
Oh, man!
Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
Think we'll find him?
Hi.
Definition.
I���ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.
Yeah it does.
Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...
It���s okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?
J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
Oh, doggie.
Does it hurt?
Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
What?
Yea?
Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.
Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
Say-
No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
Yes! Yeah.  [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy's a wittle scared.
Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
[through the car window] Kick Wallace's ass!
Not a question.
Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.
I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
Do you like it?
Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.
Oop, got some blisties.
Thank you.
Totally.
Great!
I... Got... It.
Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em.
You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
On it!
I did, I felt it.
Morning.
Ruh duh duh da dudes! What���s up?
But who
Yeah.
Was that hot or what?
I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.'
I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
Damn it.
And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
What, is it because he's black?
After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.
Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.
What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
I miss her too.
Three-oh-five.  You my friend are winning handsomely.
Bueno.
No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage.
I would agree with that.
No, I don���t have AIDS. That���s not what I said. Next question.
Get out of the way!
It's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.
I was telling that... I was telling that.
What do I see in Angela?
Mobsters are!
Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
Mm-hmm.
We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
Uh... [laughs sheepishly]
Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.
I'm like a quarter of the way through.
From 'Cheers'.
I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.
And you know what?  The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.
Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.
That's very generous.
[Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I'll be first in line.  Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.  If you need me let me know, gonna be around.  If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down.  If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.  Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try.  Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela.  Take a chance on me.
Hi, how's it going?
Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
I use the word ���guys��� a lot when I'm nervous...guys.
Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it���ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!
[snaps his fingers] Right on, brotha. Wurddd.
Aww.
Exactly. Help me po��� mouth, Darryl.
You were saying you chose me���. There was a reason?
No, I insist.
The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
Mm-wah! [Angela walks away, Dwight follows]
Erin likes Gabe.
Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
[To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
Sorry.
I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
I know.
Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
Well first of all, I'd just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
Well are you?
All right!
I didn't know you were going to be here.
Pi...
Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.
Still waiting on that check.
Walk until you hear the beehive.'
Yeah, which one?
No.
You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What's that?
Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him.
Ha! Knew it!
It's the new guy. [looks at Jim]
Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Maybe it's just more like, 'be mine.'
Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.
What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...
Oh Man! [clapping]
Seriously, you guys, ask me.
Wow. Prison sounds horrible.
I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!
You're going to believe that guy?
It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.
Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot��� these.
Um Phyllis, who's that?
Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, 'Don't Just Dream it, do it.' Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure's Crazy Train]
Wha...?
No time to chat.
Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
I am not asking, I am ordering.
Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small explosion sound] I'm engaged!
Everybody out.
You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs]
Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]
All right!
It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'
Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
No!
Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.
OK?
Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?
Jim's talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!
Hey! Where did you go?
Oh!
You're choking him!
Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?
Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?
[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.
You broke my heart too.
What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
Cause you���re always taking dumps.
I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.
I don't think it does that.
Hey, look at that. Done.
Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. ���Banjo at 0:19 is aight��� Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy.  I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler?
Go Einsteins!
You go first.
Nn no.
That���s���that���s what���yeah. Okay, all right, well, here���s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga���s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater���
Yes!
Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...
Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
[slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
Well, what do you want?
[puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering]
That you���re learning a made-up language from HBO���s Game of Thrones?  I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.
Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
Ugh.
You give up?
Mmmm...
Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, 'in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.' [laughs]
Oh. Okay.
So no?
Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?
Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly]
But I just���it���s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn���t���
[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.
Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
Got it. [lowers head to show hair, but keeps looking up just as she tries to take the picture]
Yes.
How'd it look?
Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.
Fine.  I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book.  Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading.
Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.
I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner.
[writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
Okay.
Shane. Great game man!
Perfect.
You're being an idiot get..
Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.
Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.
One, two, three, go!
I���m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it���s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
Thirty minutes!
What?
Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
How next to?
See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.
Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
[removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It���s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That���s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
So... how was lunch?
No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.
You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?
That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
Here it is, you should draw a picture...
Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
[grunts] Augh.
Oh, K. It's only three weeks.
I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods.
[sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
I'm not asking for one, I need it.
A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
Yeah. No. Well, ok.
[scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.
No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]
But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...
A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
Whoa--
Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.
Ring her up.
Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
So Darryl says to me ���fire me���. But what he really means is ���I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.��� So I say ���No, you're not fired.��� But what I really mean is ���I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.���........I really hope that's what he and I mean.
So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia. [grossed our remarks from around the office as Andy holds p a picture of a nude man]
You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs]  I graduated in four years.  I never studied once.  I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, 'Here Comes Treble.'
Didn���t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
What was that?
Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn���t.  [to Robert] I���m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now.
Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.'
Oh... [Kelly laughing]
Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
[chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.'
Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.
It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant 'Happy Secretary's Day' banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin's chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey...
Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time.  Good luck with your impossible dream.
Keep eating tuna, Big Tuna. Loser!
We're done. Erin and I are over.
I didn't know you had a brother.
Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight's hand]
[yells] Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
You're running from the problem.
Thanks, Kevin.
Did you tell them?
Whoa!
[Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
We will start here at Erinville.
Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
Oh, I do!
Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.
Hey Dwight, I bet I can stack faster than you can.
[to Robert California] Hi Dad!...... Ahhh���.oh boy.
Nobody wants ...that, to happen.
Yeah.
Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.
Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
Oh, okay...
Mornin' Jim.
Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so...
Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.
[to Erin]. Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
Me too.
So, Stanley, are you really outta here?
Reverse snobbery.
Oh, that burns! Golly. Um...
Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar]
Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales:  Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.
The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. [shot shows warehouse crew going wild in the office] This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.
Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. [laughs] Well, yeah, whatever. So. [walks away]
