Yeah and we���re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you���d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
I actually had that down in the cons column, but...
Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.
Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys! [dances along to the drumming]
Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal���s going out on.
[runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.
Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
[sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?']
That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.
Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?
[sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.
Yeah, but here���s the thing. I can���t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I���ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
All right, everybody's still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.  [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs]
Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk.
Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.
Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.
Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
Yes! Yeah.  [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
What is goin' on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]
Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.
I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!
For Madame et monsieur. [hands Michael and Marie a glass of wine]
Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?
Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
[on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ���95. Hey there, um, I���m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question.  I may be missing a chapter here���De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale���uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I���m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs]
Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]
Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.
Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell]
Hand me that water.  I always say 'Beer me.'  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how's what's-her-name?
Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
Well, it���s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.''
which I will not be a part of-
Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
If I am not Boner Champ, I don���t know who I am.
I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley's monitor]
Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.
[also as anchor] Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?
No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? [starts singing to the tune of Feist's 1234] One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather...
Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot��� these.
Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]
Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
It's the world's only international sport! [sits down]
Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You're doing great, by the way.
Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. [to Darryl] Good. Great job.
Oscar says ���hi��� all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. ���Hi��� ���Hello��� ���Hola��� You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say ���hi���?
Do you have a specific place in mind?
[snaps fingers] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?
Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.
[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.
Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?
Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
You don���t have any-- Any questions about the old days? [clears throat] You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]
Can't argue with that. Dwight ... [takes Angela's hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other]
[writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
Alright everybody, great season of softball, I'm super proud of you guys and I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together. [Andy plays video]
Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word ���no��� not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I���m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.
Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?
I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.
You���re exactly right and you get a point.
[announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.
Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.
Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.
Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.
Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?
It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's.
I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don���t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I���m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.
Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee���
You know, I don���t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog���s outta here, so letting it all hang out!
[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There's just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.
Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em.
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said ���You can't be a skipper until you're a man.��� You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance.
Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy's hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.
Well I have the, the blue book value...
Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words ���HARD ASS���] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.
No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.
I was telling that... I was telling that.
It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
And remember:  Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
Do you know why you never heard of it?
And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It���s Clark and, um���
0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!
It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.
Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?
[whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit.
Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
I want you to print that out for me.
You're asking him to give up all of his power.
I don't know yet, I have to call you back.
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.
OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.
Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes���
This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!
After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.
Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?
You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
Which combo do you think Robert's gonna like better?
Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...
Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. [sings] Suite 401.
I���ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]
Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh...
Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] 'Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.'
Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.
Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that���s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.
I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.
Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we���re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
Well, why don���t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin]
[enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one.
Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.'
Why did we pretend like we work here?
[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here.
One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
[grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That���s final.
I���m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it���s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
Fine.  I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book.  Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading.
See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...
Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage]
Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass.
What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
[exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.
Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?
It was before, my tech- my technical training.
Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles]
...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.
We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.
Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
