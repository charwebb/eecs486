Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...
Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You're the best ever!
Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.
I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.'
He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?
I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]
[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!
Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it���s really stupid, but it���s also really, really, really important.
Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] ���Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.��� Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
[sits at Dwight���s desk] Got any hot leads?
I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'
Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
Yeah....I don't think that's legal. It's a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?
I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.
[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.
Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] 'Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.'
I know that it���s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that���s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname 'Boner Champ,' that is when I became me.
[Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.
You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
Who, Karen?  Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How's the apartment hangin'?
Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
Hand me that water.  I always say 'Beer me.'  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how's what's-her-name?
Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door]
Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.
Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.
[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]: Look alive.
I, I thought that you would like it.
Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
I will! I will take all of those dogs!
You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.
Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch.
Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.
[playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
[Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How's it goin' man?
Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.
Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...
[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you���re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges��� reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly���
Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office.  Naturally, it's where I need to be.  The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.
What���s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!
[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.
[leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]
It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
Darryl said, ���Cool, man.��� He called me as cool man.
Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it���s like taking a test, but I know the answers.
We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in.
They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs]
Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don���t squash my knickety-knacks on top.
Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.
Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.
This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just...
Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.
Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What's that?
I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy's a wittle scared.
Few other super simple reminders ��� no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
Spring sing ���95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
[answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?
Out of my office, turns out you're fired...
Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.
Tell me about it, you know? I���ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don���t know if I���m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,
[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you���re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all.  Anybody?
Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.
They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter.
I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.
It could totally work though. I don���t know why we wouldn���t. Oh my god are we doing this?
[has two tissues in his nostrils] It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.
[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!
Ooh I didn���t mean to offend you, and I hope you���ll forgive me because I am very very��� Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.
In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?
Yeah, totally.  I'm sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn't realize it was bothering you.
Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.
Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You're doing great, by the way.
What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I���ll tell you how we can beat it.
Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.
When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.
Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]
Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.
Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You're gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that���s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
You didn���t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now���s your chance! I���m here. You got Qs; I got As.
You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam's tummy]
Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.
[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
[signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.
Last year, I went to a seminar called 'The Ten Secrets of Real Estate'. Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.
Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
No, no, no, no, no, we don���t need to call the police. They���ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone���s business, right, Pam?
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
[grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!
Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.'
Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.
[enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
Hey, Big Tuna. You ever Google Google? What do you think would happen?
Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?
[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Se��or Loadenstein.
I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]
Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.
This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words---
It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant 'Happy Secretary's Day' banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin's chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.
Seriously? ���Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.
All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?
[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
I have everything I need- [talking over each other]
Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
[singing] Which me am I gonna be today?
Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
Well, why don���t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]
It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'
If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
Jim's talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.
Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.
Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America���s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It���s a really cool show, it���s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
