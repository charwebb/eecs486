I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves]
I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties���and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?
You know, we���ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we���re in this weird dance���.
I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.
I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her.
Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
[in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
[in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don���t, and I will find another buyer.
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.
[text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...
Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]
Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys! [dances along to the drumming]
This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ���I Dreamed a Dream��� from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.
Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.
Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so--
Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.
Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] I���m all for it.
[to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays 'Rockin' Robin']
We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.
Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.
Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ���.Confession: I don���t know what I���m doing.
Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!
The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.
Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
[To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..[Group protests]
Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.
My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal���s going out on.
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]
[voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that���s good because I was basically wrong.  I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it���s really more like they���re just people who work in an office and I���m their manager.  Yeah that���s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
I was telling that... I was telling that.
OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? [starts singing to the tune of Feist's 1234] One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather...
Scranton U. Varsity's gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad.  Should be pretty interesting.  J.V. gets really amped.
Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...
Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
No, I don���t have AIDS. That���s not what I said. Next question.
[playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]
Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.
[walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?'  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.' ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.
Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.
Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g��iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]
C���mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you���re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
[English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
[Australian accent] Well, what can���t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn���t noticed, I���ve got a pretty good British accent.
New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
These are incentives.  It���s how we���re gonna double growth. Now, you���re probably all asking yourselves: ���Well, how does this work?���
I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.
I got into Cornell off the Wait List.  A lot of people were like, 'Oh, you just got into Cornell because your dad donated a building.'  No.  Okay.  I got into Cornell because I'm smart.  I'm smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things.
Cool.  I can't control what you do.  I can only control what
[removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It���s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That���s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
It���s okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?
Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?
Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so.
You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]
Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?
Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
[on video] Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. [plays banjo, screen types out ���you suck my nutz��� from TexasPoonTappa, camera zooms out to reveal Nellie]
Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?
Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.
I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ['displays' Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed]
What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?
Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]
Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
���..OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.
Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] ���Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.��� Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.
It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet.
I���m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
Let me get a picture of you guys.
Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.
I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience.  So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna...
So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.
[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'
No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it���s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let���s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
I know, I know that you're proud of me.
Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
[answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...
Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it?  Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
No, it didn't--nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?
No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.
Carla Fern is not just an actor���s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
[writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
[to a full conference room] Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. [general acknowledgement]
Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]
Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot��� these.
Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time.  Good luck with your impossible dream.
What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him.
Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?
Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.
[mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]
Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy.
���ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
Do you know why you never heard of it?
I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all.  Anybody?
Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...
Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?
No I didn���t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?
You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
I���ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]
Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.
I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
Jim, it���s fine. He���ll just get you on his cell phone and then that���ll go viral.
I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone!
Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?
I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you're not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an 'are you kidding me?' look]
I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy's a wittle scared.
Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar���s friend walks up] Not anything.
[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.
Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.
OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out]
Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-
But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
I don't know yet, I have to call you back.
Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! [Pam throws football, hits Meredith's face]
Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.
David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.
I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint]
Didn���t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
Seriously? ���Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic]
Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
