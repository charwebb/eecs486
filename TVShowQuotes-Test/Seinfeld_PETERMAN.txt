So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
(slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.
That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.
But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
I'd be happy to Elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but I will have to see this hat.
Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000.
Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
