I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
It is a real hoot.
She is The Best. What was your name again.
So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
I think not.
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.
(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.
The fire will eat up this entire block!
You do?
She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
You want to know something? I no longer need them!
So did you have any trouble finding the place?
Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
George!
