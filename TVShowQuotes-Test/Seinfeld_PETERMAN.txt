Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. (indicating empty chair)
Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000.
(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?
(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)
Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
(busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
