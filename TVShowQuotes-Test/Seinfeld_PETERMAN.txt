Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.
Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
George, give me your ATM card!
That's NOT bad!
I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.
Mmmmm--nah.
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
She's gone. Bosco?
So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.
George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
