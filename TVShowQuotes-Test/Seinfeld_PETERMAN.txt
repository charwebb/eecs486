Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
(to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
So did you have any trouble finding the place?
(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?
Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000.
It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired.
Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
