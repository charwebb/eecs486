If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!
I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.
Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.
Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?
Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?
Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.
Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.
But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
