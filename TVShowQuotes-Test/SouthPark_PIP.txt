Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.

Don't you wanna play anymore?

Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.

You? But why?

Good-bye, sir.

I'm not French--

Good day, Damien. How are you?

Oh.

I won!

Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!

None, sir.

I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There you are.  And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! 

My, how lovely.

Twenty-six baby bunnies

Oh I... rather thought I was.

I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!

Really? I don't believe it. 

Uh, Mr. Chef sir?
