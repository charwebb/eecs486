Oh, bother.

Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.

Hello, Estella.

I'd love to!

Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?

Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!

Who is that?

Aaaaaaaargh!

I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, "Turrah!" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.

Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!

Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I? 

Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.

Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?

Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.

O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day! 

Oh, dear.

Oh! Oh I think I found one! 

Really? I don't believe it.
