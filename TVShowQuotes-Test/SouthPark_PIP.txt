Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.
Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. 
'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!
Because I believe I'm in love with you.
Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?
Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah! 
Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!
Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
