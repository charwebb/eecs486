Satan, I understand.

Where are Butters and Eric?

A dog parade? 

Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!

And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.

Well all right! Good for you, Butters!

I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!

Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.

Linda?? What are you doing?? 

What's the matter?

Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon? 

Yeah...

Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.

We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. 

Oh. 

No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life!

I love you, Satan.

I'll do that. Have fun, boys. 

Son! I don't believe it!
