I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything.  Right?  Right.

Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.

Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?

So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.

Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!

L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  And I just want you to know  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends.

I just think we all need to get this out in the open.

Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.

Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?

And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.

Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
