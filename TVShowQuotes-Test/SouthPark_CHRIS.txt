Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight.
No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation..
Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. 
Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you.
Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! 
Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is.
Hey look, this trailer goes right into a building. 
We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.
I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!
So you see, there was no "Some Puerto Rican Guy." He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You're a liar! You're a LIAR!"  "You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!"  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, "Hello," but they'd be thinking, "Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"  "You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!"  And to me, people might say things like,  "LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!"  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  "You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!"  "CONFESS!"  "LIAR! CONFESS!"  You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.
Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?
