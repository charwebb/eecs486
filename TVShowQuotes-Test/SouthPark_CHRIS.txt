Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! 

Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch?  I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that.

Agghhh!  Oh God!

That's our man. Here you go. 

No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.

Butters, where is the movie you were watching?

Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.

Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?

A dog parade? 

Let's go, son.

Ow!  Goo-aagh..! 

Yes?  Oh, hello, boys.

We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. 

The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.

Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You have to learn to keep it straight!

Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.

Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!

Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired.

...Butters... You're as right as rain.
