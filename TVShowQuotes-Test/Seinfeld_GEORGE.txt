Oh, my god.
Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
Oh. You still wanna go?
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
What's casus belli.
It's effeminate to sit like this?
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
Yeah, me too...
Why can't we share?
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
No, but Im very uncomfortable.
You find this interesting, don't you?
Yeah.
Never.
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
Me too.
You had to move the mirror?
Oh, well...
Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
Not that much.
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?
She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
You stole the bread?
Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?
Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
I like Mike Lubika.
Oh. How's she doing?
Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
Kind of.
What happened to the raisins?
Yeah.
Why d'you think I'm going now?
Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice)
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Give me the phone!
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
I... I... I long for you.
WOW!
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
Lighten up.
Yeah.
Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
I will, sir. Top priority.
Nooo...
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
Yes, I mentioned your name.
No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
Hey, thanks for coming with me.
Yeah.
(hesitates) ...Nooooooooooo...
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
Can you believe that guy?
(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
Sir?
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy.
Nope!
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
Witness.
(disappointment) Oh. Course not.
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?
Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
Nah.
Yeahhh.
Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
No kidding?
(Definite) Oh yeah.
Hi Allison, thats a nice dress.
No, it's not.
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
You didn't ask him?
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
Okay, what are we gonna do?
What?
Jerry, Jerry
I knew it. I always felt different.
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
June. Juune, baby!
I'm bad. I'm *bad*!
Can't go, Why not?
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
You have to drink that whole thing?
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
I have a fear of intimacy
You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
Morning, ma.
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?
Hey!
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
Again with the Rava.
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
How ya doin'?
Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
Uh no no, shes working.
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
T-bone steak.
Maybe I am.
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
So what're you gonna do?
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
Ohhhhhh
(on the phone) Oh my God.
Peter Jennings had one.
Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
That's why they gave you the apartment?
Kramer put Jerry on the phone.
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
They never try anything.
It was.
Couldnt be better.
Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
Who was it?
Whad you do that for?
Him who? Hayman him.
No. Definitely not.
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
Nope. I wept like a baby.
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
(Interrupting) No!
Where is he?
I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
when did you get back?
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
Is it? (reaches into bag)
(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
Let's have it.
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
Oh, when is that car service coming?
No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
(joyful) June. It's June.
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
You saw Jane topless?
And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
She is succinct.
(CONT'D) ...with that group.
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
Hey, wanna get some lunch?
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
You know, .. blah ...
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
Oh no, I am down!
Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
Well, well, well.
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
Is it about me?
I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
How'd your foot fall asleep?
huh Kramer it's huh.. gonna be pretty dangerous up there
Might meet a celebrity.
Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
The pig-man can take the bus.
Well you should have been O'Brien.
(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
Why?
Ooh, so what?
Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
Elaine? (she turns, sighing) Can I come?
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
Well, I'm here. What is it?
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
Well, that's a given.
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
What'd I do?
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
A guy?
With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
well humm.. lets get some coffee.
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
You really think so?
I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
What is Pericles?
Thank you.
Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
Oh boy.
Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
What about that?
(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
I've never seen a big salad.
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
Told me what?
He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
We had sex.
Well, it's definetly him.
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
Yeah.
We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..
Yeah, Cubans.
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
Why don't you ever go shopping?
What do I do?! What do I do?!
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
Ooh!
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
Nnnnnnngaaa!
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
Yada.
So, is he okay?
(points) And him!
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
Strawberry, Cranberry ...
Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.
(pleading) Well, my bed is too small.
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
No, no...
I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
For a woman.
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
No catchin.
Was the alarm on?
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
Nah.
Alright, the dentist thing was not good.
You don't care for Soda?!
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
(Only turning back for a second) Hey.
This guy sounds just like me.
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
I'm Cartwright!
Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
Ok, what did you say?
(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
So?
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
Hey Alec
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
No not really.
(smiling) Yes sir.
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
Could be the leaves...
look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
You knew? How did you know?
Where?
You haven't even seen one.
My back is killing me.
Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
Yeah.
Hi Elaine
Yeah, how did you know that?
Ehh, You could get in trouble.
No, no....(mumbles)
Won't be a problem...(mumbles)
Gwen really wants to go.
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
We could.
Stopped dead.
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
All right, what are we doing?
Hey oh.
Piece of cake; hu.
Maybe I could be a land guy.
What?
What, you didn't wash all day?
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
Ow! Dad...
No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
Oh, that's me.
[pause] Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I, I'm fighting not to. Fighting! Unfortunately I uh have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta' get up and hit that pavement
What happened to you?
(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
Who's he?
(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
Moose?
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
What, you know Jerry?
Women like skiers.
Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
Who?
Well why'd she do that?
Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
Well, we.. we, we, ah..
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
What does that do?
Hey!
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
I'm sorry I missed it.
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.
Elaine's coming up?
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
They said tomorrow, maybe.
Oh, boy. Here she comes.
( becoming more and more awkward) Yeah.....
(To Jerry) Jerk off.
Phew!
Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
Uh huh.
She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
No? Are you crazy?
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
I don't think it's gonna work out...
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
(casually) Sure, why not.
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
Will that be cash, or cheque?
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
This country needs more people like you!
Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold.
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
A player?
He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.
You think she would care about the red dot?
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
Oh.
Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
No. It didn't take.
(Offering) Drink?
Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
Hey! Saturday night!
Like that?
She said that?
No forget the story.
I don't want you to call.
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
So what do you care?
So she doesn't like me?
No good?
Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
What?!
It'll take to long.
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
I'M NOT A LIER!
I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
So, what did she say?
Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
No.
Oh, shut up!
Big screen TV?
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
Medical journals!
Kramer!
Elaines moving into your building?
(hesitatingly) ... no...
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
No. No T-bone.
Why them? Why not me?
You got mugged?
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
Absolutely...
Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
Maybe like this.
Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
Oh, shhh.
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
There's nothing to talk about.
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
Oh, right. Oh no, man.
Maybe he didnt show up.
Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
No, no, she might just think its a gift.
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
Of course it is.
Oh, hi.. (They shake hands)
Exactly.
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?
Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
Not bad? It's gorgeous!
Where?
So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?
This bread has nuts in it!
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
Me neither. I've never been happy.
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
You mean that's true, I'm right?!
So?
Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!
I uh, took care of that.
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
(dismissive) It's no good.
Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
The tag, huh?
What?
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
Yeah.
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
Oh. Who is this guy?
Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
No.
I can't believe this is happening.
Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!
You're you.
Nucleosis.
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
All this in 5 days. Hmm.
My *father* is gay...
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
You're blown?
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
Was my father wearing a cape?
What!?
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
(muttering to himself) I wonder why.
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
To hell with Elaine!
Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?
Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...
Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
So what? What am I supposed to do?
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
Blanket
Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
Sorry, the card says Moops.
Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
You mean, like, a former member?
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
Oh, my God...
Nothing at all.
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
I can't park in a garage.
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
Youre gonna overdry it.
What the hell is this?
Really? You wanna come?
Oh great.
I don't see any way around it.
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
Revenge.
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
It's good, right?
Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
Look at that. Theyre done!
How're the folks?
Peter?
It's not funny, Elaine.
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
Big news?
Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
Then why don't you try and get him another job?
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
What was that all about?
To ask her out.
(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
You've got a prayer.
What's goin'on?
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
She cant kill me right?
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
That's it.
Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
No its a regular religion.
Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
(Smiling) Nothing.
Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
Mmm... no.
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
So it was a good experience.
Your wake up guy asked you out?
[sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
You know, we absolutely should.
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.
You got it.
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
It's nothing, stop it..
Moths?
How'd you hook up with these guys?
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
145!
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
I can't tell anymore.
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
(whispering) Elaine, it's me, George.
They saw me walk out.
I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.
What is with this damn zipper?
I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
Yeah, they're not better than me.
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
Well, You're not gonna believe it...
You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
Oh, cmon, Jerry. I cant believe this.
Ohh, yeahh.
How'd the Mets do?
(Talking it) Im here helpin you.
Those are Susan's friends.
That's what I wanna know.
Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
But I-I-I-
You think?
Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
Why not?!
Isn't it?
Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
I didn't get any bread.
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
Vinyl yeah, maybe.
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!
What?
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
How can you just get it?
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!
Do they pay people to watch movies?
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
Alright.
Go back?
(Acting innocent) I'm all set.
Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
...ah (picks up the bag) Damn salami.
Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
...Are you sure?
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
Yeah.
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
Good. I think you forgot something.
There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.
(singing) Meet the Mets...
Beautiful.
I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
What? I work here.
Could we talk about this some other time?
To spite your parents!
..Okay.
Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
Oh boy..
Is she socially awkward?
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
They gave me the Pensky file.
I never heard him say anything really funny.
Hey!.. What can I tell ya.
You still owe me a secret.
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
You're choking me.
No, YOU do!
Ah, that is disgusting--
Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
What?! Why?
Mr. Steinbrenner--
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Uuh, sleepy.
I was just in there. Its embarrassing.
"Right!"
He he...So huh! What's with the suitcase.
Maybe we should call her.
He was really crying?
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.
He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
Oh, my God.
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
Yes we will.
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
Convulsing?
Mine!
Oh, this is my friend Jerry.
(waves his hands) Big breasts!
It's George
What about the mail?
What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
I can't tell you, don't ask.
Discovered a cure for baldness.
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
The last time I saw her, she was naked.
Very.
Yeah. See ya.
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
If she'd just take a plane somewhere.
But I'm not a marine biologist!
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
Depends on what?
With extreme prejudice.
He knows that!
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
Hey, how ya doing?!?
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
Of course it is.
So we're not going?
(Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.
Yes, I think I would.
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
(shouts) Marisa Tomei!
Bye, Dolores.
What?
You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
Wohoo, check it out.
Of course.
"Jimmy, right."
(leaps to feet) Jerry!
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
Well I gotta undo what I did.
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?
Are you coming back down?
I made him up.
Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
(Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..
"Plyometric?"
Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?
Thank God that's over.
I'm gonna play frolf.
Teasing.
How do you know?
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
I like (imitates Kramer) "cookies."
Latex, latex manufacturing
Yeah.
Have you ever had their egg salad?
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
Tell me.
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
Yea
Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.
With all due respect, I don't think so...
That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?
(happy) Oh! Okay.
(to Jerry) You're very special.
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
(well, obviously) Yes.
(hopeful) So, details?
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
Beautiful!
I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
Little baked beans
Nah.
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
S-Susan
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
You're sleepin' with the maid?
What for?
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
Id like to help, but my neck..
Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
It's my head!
Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
A bench? What kind of a bench?
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
Yeah.
I know! I was squinting.
Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
I didnt say any other bawdy things.
Hey.
We do?
No...
From China. All the way from China.
...you're very attractive...
Hey, what are you doing?
There must be some way to find out.
Jerry, I'm Yankee management.
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
I happen to dress based on mood.
(over the speaker) It's George.
(Reluctantly) Yeah.
They want you to do a TV show?
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
Maybe it was a mouse.
No, no, what, what?
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
... Susan.
Yes. Changes.
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
Hi.
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
Hey, he,
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
I don't know what the reason could be.
No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
Thanks.
Hey, hey.
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
I don't want to hear it, Kramer!
I think I can still catch her.
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
Elaine?
Hello.
The Indian?
De-compressing.
So I still haven't heard about that job.
If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
I had the arm! Joe...
K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
Natalie?
Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.
Oh my God, its exactly the same!
Ooh, a shower cap!
You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
I enjoy understanding.
(unenthusiastic) Congratulations.
You're *damn* right it's me.
I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
It's my father's car!
Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
So he explained it all to you?
What, you should've just asked her.
I've said that before?
Hey, Kramer.
I can't get a massage from a man.
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
Why not?
Yeah, him.
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
I heard they found a family in your freezer
What happened?
No. I did.
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
LBJ?
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
me too, I am down, I am totally down, mark me down
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
George?
Come on! Come on!
Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
You spoke to my mother?
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
Are they here?
Si, por favor.
(on the speaker) Ya
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
I'm not kidding, you should do it.
Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
(sighs) Guess not. What should I do?
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
Big fan! Big fan.
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
Hi. George.
Never expected this did you?
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
