Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
Dont you think you get more without it?
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
How come you don't know what street are you on?
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
What about the body, what kind of body?
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
So I still haven't heard about that job.
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
You think she would care about the red dot?
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
You came to see me. I work in the building.
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
