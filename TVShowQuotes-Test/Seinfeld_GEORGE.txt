Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!
Please, this is very, very important.
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
No! Theres no coconut!
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
Yeah, why? Why?
(pointing to himself) Like me?
He was really crying?
Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
Clearer
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
Yeah! Right!
We could.
Quick for a... catered affair.
(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
Do you?
all right! rock-climbing! J..just the 2 of us? alright! hey I'll make some sandwiches, what what do you like? tuna? peanut butter?
Do ya?
Go, go, go, don't worry about it.
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
Of course. We all do.
I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
Karen.
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
Hello?
Who is this Rava?
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
They don't want to see me anymore!
Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
Oh, Im crazy!
Ehh, You could get in trouble.
Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted...
Yeah
Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
Hello-o-o-o Elaine!
I'm better than him.
Ohhhhh.. John-John.
Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
You know we're living in a society!
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
Alright, maybe four.
Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)
So, was it me?
(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
My moneys all tied up in change right now.
The rule is a minimum of two days.
What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
Blimp The Hindenburg Story.
What did Jodi say?
How do you feel? Confident?
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
Hi.
Well, I heard a noise.
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
Jean-Paul?
Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
What?
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
What does that do?
What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
No! Absolutely Not!
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
Why not. I would be.
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
I didn't encourage. No encourage.
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
Something, nothing, I could care less.
What company was it?
Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
I know, sir. It won't happen again.
A scar?
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
Where are you sitting?
Something's up, there's something in the air.
Yeah.
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
Oh, my God...
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
So?
I didn't know she took it!
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
Not at all.
(gestures towards book) But I proved it!
I feel alive, Jerry.
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
Have you seen 'em?
(to Jerry) Ready?
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
Big screen TV?
I'll have the Clams Casino.
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
Mint?
It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?
Hi.
Celia? W-w-what are you doing here?
You got aloe? I love aloe.
She wasn't flirting with you.
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
What?
What was that?
Go, go, get out, ...
Huh (quietly)
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
Im a weed in Hitlers bunker.
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
Rick.
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
I've coupled! I've coupled!
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
Elaine, shut-up.
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
What time is it?
No. I didn't get it.
No.
(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
Big news?
I know. I know.
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
Actually, I did have a thought.
Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
(Pause) Yeah.
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
Really?
I'm going to the bathroom.
You going to the party?
Well...not "out." She's a prisoner.
Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?
Hey!
I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-
Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
Wa, uh, ...
Okay, I mean it's serious but--
Where did you get those socks?
Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
Wait a second. (smells it). all right.
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
Well, how good a look did you get?
Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
(shifty) Yeah.
(shouting) No No No!
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
Give me one.
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.
Are you going to help me or not?
What about this leftover Chinese food?
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
No, no, she might just think its a gift.
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
Where's Elaine?
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?
He'll be back on Monday.
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
Great.
Don't be soured.
(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
Do you hear that?
Yeah?
What do you know? You were in the nut house.
Maybe I am.
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
Catch what in time?
Boy, these really do pinch the nose.
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
You broke up with her? Why?
Wha.. you ran?
You see.....WHAT!!
Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.)
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
Velvet...
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm mentioning his name.
The New York Yankees!
Alright, just forget it.
That's got nothing to do with it.
Not the point!
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
Why him? Why not me?
What's her name?
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
Really?
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
Really?
(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!
(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
How's it going?
Please, it's--
I'd get tired of it.
I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
Finished.
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
Yep, this one for our side!
So you can't duplicate 'em.
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
With all due respect, I don't think so...
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
I never heard him say anything really funny.
It's me.
Clothes shopping.
Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
Oh.
Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
I don't know.
Yeah, so what?
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
Boy oh boy.
[Accusingly] What's *that*?
I think I like the girl better than the voice.
What's for supper?
The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Why?!
Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
Obviously.
Can't be done.
It makes me look older.
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
I know. Completely bonkers!
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
Yo, Anna.
...Six wrong?
I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
Really? You wanna come?
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
Mmm... no.
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
Oh, yes. Hello.
I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
He gave me a wedgie.
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
No, Newman, stop it.
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
I have to talk to you about something .
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
You miss her.
The Friars Club?
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
Nucleosis.
Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
I think something's happening here.
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
Who's Grossbard?
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
All right, all right.
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
Joe...could you...
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
Well, I'm, I'm just looking.
(thinking) This guy's perfect.
I could..
We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!
Let me just call him.
You're choking me.
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
Elaine
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
Sure.
Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
"It doesn't help"
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
Hey Elaine.
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
Well, who is she?
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
Is there any money involved?
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
Well I've done that.
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
How nice?
I know I was just telling them the story.
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
Very good. Juicy.
Matches? Long matches.
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
Yea
Why not?
Oh, right. Oh no, man.
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
I tell you everything, right?
George?
Hey. You ready?
She's bald.
"Hey you know , I felt we had like a synergy out there,you know, like we were really helping each other."
He doesn't feel funny.
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
Yeah, that's right.
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
Why does she want you to be mad?
So?
I do for the bad things.
Movies. I like to watch movies.
(frustrated) Ahh!
She wants me to take an IQ test.
You've been demoted.
I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.
I'M NOT A LIER!
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
Another job?
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
Food was good.
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
No, she wasn't on the horse.
All right, I want you to do me a favor.
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
Yes, yes I am.
Well, yeah.
Italian.
What!?
Oh, shut up!
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
Yeah, just like I do.
This woman drove us out of our minds
Why, the color?
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
I'm following him.
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
I hear thee.
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
What's with this guy?
I know. I know.
Hey.
All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
How could he not have washed?
Well, it's definetly him.
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
All the way?
How are you closer to him than me?
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
Hnh. That's nerve...
"Hemmm!.. Fine!"
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
What did she say?
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
(taken aback) The actress?
What happened to your itch?
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
How'd she find it?
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
(grabbing lapels) J. Crew.
Jerry, I'm Yankee management.
You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
Wha, that's a Kinney lot?
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
He eats those?
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
Hey, I've done that today.
Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
Sid, it's completely his fault.
This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
Well, that's.. Elaine!
(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
So long, Mr. Farkus.
You tell Russell.
No. No T-bone.
It's OK.
Fire! Get out of the way!
Yeah.
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
I told you.
Embracing my roots.
What the hell is going on here?
(Nodding, writing) "How's it going?"
Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
No, why, what's happening?
From China. All the way from China.
I'm back, baby, I'm back!
(Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
Let me see the watch.
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
I never heard of that.
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
(excited) Yeah, the pilot!
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
Yada yada yada...
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
Who says?
I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
I might.
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?
Really?
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
I don't want him to!
No kidding?
Really? Who?
Why did you give him my ticket for?
And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
What about Six?
It's, funny runnin' into you here.
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
Peter, Paul and Mary.
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
What?
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
I'm getting a makeover.
Come on. Will you stop it.
Alright, here we go.
You're kidding.
Exactly!
Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
What about them?
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
Venetian Blinds.
It's coming Jerry, it's coming.
Why?
Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
Moths?
(frantic) I'm calling Jerry.
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
They way he just says stuff.
What, you should've just asked her.
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
Do you wanna fight?
(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
No.
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
What are you talking about?
Whats in it?
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
What?
She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
What?! Why?
(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
What's that?
But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
Oh, come on, you're good at this.
What is Pericles?
You don't?
(whispering) Elaine, it's me, George.
(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?
Nowhere.
Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
Conrad, is it?
You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
Kramer, can we do this later..
No, but Im very uncomfortable.
How'd your foot fall asleep?
Hey oh.
Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
Alright ok. You got the tape?
I heard they found a family in your freezer
How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
What'd I do?
Burned.
(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
You better call her.
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
I called it.
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
For vomiting on her vest!
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
I can't tell you, don't ask.
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
The outlet?
Well they're hard to load.
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
(leaps to feet) Jerry!
Can't leave the car here!
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
3 days.
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
Yeah, sure.
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
Really? How'd she do that?
She might be leaving to work any minute.
Any money in it?
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
He knows?
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
Please, it's not necessary.
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
Yeah, hell have my parents.
You got the Yankee envelope?
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
what rock?
Heh, Mercury head. You mind?
Elaine.
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
He left perfect imprints.
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
Jerry...
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
I enjoy understanding.
Come on, lets go!
Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
Yes?
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
Which one?
Yeah. Did you do it?
More jokes?
(to Jerry) Dont you find that strange?
What is this? This is a drawing.
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!
(regarding the menu) What're you getting?
Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
Not necessarily.
I don't know what the reason could be.
So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
Wait a minute let me call Susan.
Gwen really wants to go.
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
Is it a clockwise swirl?
(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
What're.. What're you talking about?
Lights out.
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
George is in big trouble....
Are they here?
Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
Do they pay people to watch movies?
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
What?
There's nothing to talk about.
Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
Hello?
Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
Really? What does it mean?
You think I'm going down?
Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
That's pretty pathetic.
They will get a good home won't they?
Y'know. About *us*.
Stacey.
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
A tractor.
What about the body, what kind of body?
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
I didn't do nothin'.
....But after that we really talked didn't we?
You know a hug definitely good.
Who was it?
Huh?
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
Sorry.
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
(angrily) Oh you mother...
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
Yeah, but you know where it is.
You think?
You had to move the mirror?
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
.........What's that?...
The Human Fund.
(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
She'll Twirl.
I have a point, I have a point.
Oh.
Oh mother of God.
There he is. Right on time as usual.
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
So what?
Not a bad way to make a buck.
Yeah?
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
I'm in a transition phase right now.
Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?
Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
Maybe I won't send her that check.
George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
Dont you wanna go upstairs first?
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
I don't have a hi-fi.
My Susan?
Have you ever given your code to anyone?
Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
Well, uh, are there any other options?
Seven forty-five.
Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
Enjoy, enjoy.
Say? What? Nothing, I...
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
You know, I'm a little nervous.
Just for these sponges?
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?
Come on!
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
I'm back in business, baby!
You did?
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
What did he give you for it.
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
Well, what is it?
You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
No!
I don't find her attractive.
Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?
Lighten up.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
I gotta buy a present now?
Who's the Drake?
Holy cow!
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
Walked around? And you looked?
Jerry?
We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
Oh, the virgin?
Not now Florice.
It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
(hopeful) Everything?
The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
Really?
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!
I walked.
Jerry! Stop it!
Right.
Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys?
I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
I'm not* sure.
Embezzlement.
Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
(whistling)
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
Let me see that. (Studies the note)
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
No! Tell her.
What do you tip a chamber maid.
What is Borax?
Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
Wh..what're you doing here?
Shh! This is it!
Was the alarm on?
You do it for me.
I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
Cracks? What were they saying?
I'm too nice.
(delighted!) Woooo!
I hear everything.
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.
Told you.
You're doing all the leg work.
MOOPS
What? Why?
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
So Dad,--
See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
It's in... transit.
That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom.
"He jumps!"
How many people does he do that for?
Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
So I spoke to the security guard.
Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
No. No
Call the Embassy.
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.
(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
Like us. (Elaine enters)
...Who's not doing this for the money.
(hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
(to Danielle) Whose cane is this?
"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
Get out of here, why?
Yeah, him.
Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
Are you sure?
And your wine.
You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?
These kids called me a Mary.
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
Bone marrow.
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?
You're throwing the set?
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
...you're very attractive...
Im not?
Hand sandwich.
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
Uh, my speech?
There's Elaine.
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
No, no,
Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
I got the job?
So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
I'll see you guys later.
All right! We're here!
Now you're off on a topic.
(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
(Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.
Don't do it!
Cosmo
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
Live?
ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
He knows the worlds theory.
Hey, theres Kramer & Darren.
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
How can you just get it?
All the time.
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
What do you think I said?
Lowes Paragon, 84th and Broadway.
You're going to the Tony's?
Was it my fault?
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
I tell you; I'm wiped.
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
So, Lena was upset, huh?
(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
Hey! what are listening to?
No, not a loser!
Jerry?
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
(bashful) No, that's me.
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
Well, what'd you think?
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
Never expected this did you?
Oh! Dropped a napkin...(Whispers) Jerry!
Yeah.
(impatient) For her. Not for you.
Thats so brutal, I hate that.
It will be my first one.
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
