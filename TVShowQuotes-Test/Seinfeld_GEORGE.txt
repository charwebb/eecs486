You know, we absolutely should.
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
With me or in general?
No, tell me.
Hey! what are listening to?
This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
(to Jerry) You're very special.
What's her name?
Nothing.
Hawaii?
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
Elaine, you have to sleep with me.
What?
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
(forcing a laugh) Hu, ha.
It's Jerry's fault.
Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
You tell Russell.
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
It wasn't that bad.
Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
Ohhhhhh
She is a good waitress.
You're out?!
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
I don't know.
Well I didnt do it for my mother.
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
She works for NBC.
Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
What? Where are you going?
Thirty.
(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
Kramer...
What's the worst thing that could happen?
I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
'Hoochie mama'?
Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
No.
Isn't that where they remove the--
Yes it is! You're very charming!
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
(bashful) No, that's me.
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
What a succinct story.
I'll die out here.
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
Wa?
That won't be necessary.
Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
Hello there. I'm George Costanza.
It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
Your buttocks are spectacular.
With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
It's a funny observation.
You miss her, don't you?
I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
Did you say, "The rines are crossed?"
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
The network executive. You think she liked me?
I can't believe this.
So, she cant get the apartment.
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
Where's Kramer?
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
What for?
Oh, thank you.
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
No, they had plans.
Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
Y'know. About *us*.
Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
Our show, "Jerry"?
Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
KHAN!
(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry.
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
Maybe he's just "very well RED"?
What?
Right.
Yes..
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
(surprise) Head of scouting?
Totally folksy.
Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
Youre gonna overdry it.
Hey. You ready?
(to Elaine) You dont tip a gardener!
Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.
Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
What?
Then, I'm at The Foundation...
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
Why them? Why not me?
Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
Why should I?
Boy you are really smitten.
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
Yeah?
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
Elaine? (she turns, sighing) Can I come?
You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
well humm.. lets get some coffee.
Venetian Blinds.
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
Hi, nice to meet you.
What do you mean?
No...Why should that make any difference to you?
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
(Stops) Oh right, the blind date.
We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..
So, anything to uh, nosh?
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
No kidding?
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
oh Tony don't
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
Where's the depravity?
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
There's something I have to tell you.
Where did you get those socks?
Did you talk to him?
Hey, I'm getting in on that.
Please.
(shouts) Marisa Tomei!
That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?
Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
I don't want to walk that far.
What?
Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
So, what did she say?
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
No! Tell her.
I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
Well George . . . .
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
Yeah, how did you know that?
Oh, uh...it's George.
This. Just talking.
Mmm... no.
Right.
I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
(TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary?
All right, dammit, I'm in.
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
(pause) Are you?
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
Like a park bench?
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
Pop? What happened to Pop?
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
Keep your head down.
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
See?
I tought I saw a face.
Same thing!
You mean one of those vinyl things?
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
(crouches too) What? Where? Where?
Why is that?
Why are two pretending to be laughing?
Where are you!
Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...
No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
Sweet Fancy Moses!
Bye, Dolores.
Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
3 days.
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
It's GEORGE.
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
me? "step off"
(thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
So he explained it all to you?
"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
Im a weed in Hitlers bunker.
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
All right, all right.
What about candle holders?
I didn't have make-up sex.
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
I will, sir. Top priority.
Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.
I got a headboard.
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now.
(pause) Uh-oh.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
But you have a watch on.
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
Boy, even I never heard that one...
Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
You're friends with Marisa Tomei?
LBJ?
Good for you.
Hi.
That's pretty long.
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
Wow.
She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
No. No way.
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
What?
Fortunately, yes.
You don't speak *any* English?
What'd I do?
You mean a blessing in disguise?
Looks like veal.
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
All right, where do you want it?
Curly.
bowling! what do you say bowling? bowling's insane! bowling is crazy time
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
Hey! Kramer.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
Yeah, I didn't mean that.
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
Yeah, she's a B.L.
Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
No thanks.
Youre gonna be neighbors.
Jerk!
Hey.
Pop! POP!!
(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
The last time I saw her, she was naked.
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.
Jerry, please?
Whe ... Well yeah!
Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
Excuse me?
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
Maybe I'll just meet you there.
Did you ask her?
I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.
You just hesitated.
Nowhere.
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
"George is getting upset.."
What?
Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
All right. Let's get to work.
(sarcastically) Thats funny. Youre a funny guy.
Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la! [flashbacks to Susan]
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
Oh, that's me.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
What?
He said what?
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
Where's the tamale guy?
Okay, all right, all right.
(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
Are you gonna move the car?
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
(happy) Oh! Okay.
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
I dont want to get out of it.
What?
Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
Face up on her back?
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
You going to the party?
So she's gorgeous.
So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
Ya.
Hello..
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd.
That's right.
I need an outlet!
Come on, lets go!
I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
Yes faddah.
Oh...you're very good.
Done what?
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script)
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
What is with this damn zipper?
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
It'll take to long.
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
Yeah.
It's George.
And there's you ticket.
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
Yeah.
Cosmo?
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
(animated) Then I'm going to Mars!
It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
My god!!!
. . . I'm a little scared of her.
[sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
You don't care for Soda?!
Will I call you when I get home? ha ha What do you think? ee, you kill me kill me
When she goes to the bathroom.
Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
Who?
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
(glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.
So Scott's your roommate, huh?
God bless you.
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
Oh.
No, of course not...
A player?
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
I'll take care of this, Danny.
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
No, what is it?
Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.
No complaints.
Is it, uh, doable?
What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
Why?
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
Yeah.
That's good, we'll give it a try...
What is that? Is that cashmere?
Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?
No. Believe me, he's not.
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
What?
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
Your idea?
(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
We could.
Too flashy?
Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
All right -- (Gets up to leave)
Not even close, huh?
All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
Art.
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
You like ice?
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
Well I would eat you.
Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
An idea.
129 west 81st street and hurry.
About a year ago. Wedding invitations.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
(thinking she means the breasts) What!!
I wonder if thats really true.
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
Nice day today.
I mentioned how I liked horse manure.
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
Seven-eight-four.
Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
85!
Yes Mr. Hayman.
Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go.
Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
Glad you enjoyed it.
What'd you ask me for?
You didn't make it clear.
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!
I was in the middle of a conversation.
But I-I-I-
Where?
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
No, an old friend of ours, Gary.
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.
There's a show. That's a show.
(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
I can't
Ooh!
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
Thank you very much. Dylan?
Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
Who was he?
(urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please.
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
Me too.
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
There might be some moisturizer.
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
"Will you stop with the Jimmies"
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
(sad) It's only four..
No. That's just electric.
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
It's MOOPS.
I have an aunt that died at seven.
The third?
You never should have taken away his keys!
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
Hah.
Nothing.
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
What number?
I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
That's the genius of it.
Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
You're going that way anyway!
Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.
(Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup.
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
Well, what'd you think?
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
No kidding?
When I hear her name mentioned.
But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
She knows there is nothing to talk about.
I can never get the package open in time.
Oh, yes of course, come in.
Pre-nup of course ..Kramer....
What are you doing?!
Screw the Drake!
Out of the question. Out of the question!
Yes, yes, I am.
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
I like DeSoto.
She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
(unenthusiastic) Congratulations.
Oh. How's the guy?
Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
You're going back to New York now?
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
WOULD YOU PICK A STATION!!!!!
I I just.. but..
What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
You're spending the weekend with Ellen?
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
You know what this has to do with?
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
Hi honey..
Yes, Mr. Hayman
Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
(confused) What, what's going on?
You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
Five-foot four. Why?
George, how you doing?
(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
Why did he tell you and not me?
He he...So huh! What's with the suitcase.
(CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it.
It's about nothing.
All right, I'll ask her.
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
Wow.
Right out of the clear blue sky?
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
No, no, no Elaine.
No, he isn't.
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
So what's in it for the mentor?
Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
It's the same menu.
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
No, why, what's happening?
What do you think I said?
With the two of us?
Loni Anderson?!
Are they here?
Now, stop it ...
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
I didn't get the job?
I climbed out the window.
You don't tell him?
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
There ya go.
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
So then he makes his own bed?
Everything goes with naked.
So? What'm I gonna do?
Take the suit.
Hey!
I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.)
Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
It's just not good, it's not good.
Who?
I swear.
This is for you.
Will that be cash, or cheque?
So how long has it been in the basement?
I've looked at that, seems unlikely.
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
What about accommodations?
She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
I'm Colin O'Brien.
Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?
Really?
I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
FDR?
You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
I'm "Pappy".
He asked me to keep it a secret.
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles)
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
Take a guess.
The Ray Conniff Singers. (nervous chuckle)
You dont need a gardener.
Take it right off the chest...
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
In motion. The wheels are in motion.
Oh, no, no--
And they say appearance is not important.
So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
( becoming more and more awkward) Yeah.....
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
What, it didn't bother her?
Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)
That's pretty paranoid.
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
Flame on!
Would a giant rubber ball work?
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
Breath problem?
I'm very attracted to you..
She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
Tsss...Yeah..
Fantastic!
Hey, thanks for coming with me.
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
(regarding the menu) What're you getting?
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
A hundred dollars.
She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
(whispering angrily) Okay. Okay. Fine.
What?
It's in the vault?
Should be a while though.
Yeah...
Well... it's a magnificent stone.
Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!
Haven't you kissed her?
You spritz a little Lysol on it.
I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...
...What?
(clears throat) Heather Hi, it's George Costanza.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Hello?
What do you think it's a bomb?
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
And I love you, Marisa.
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
All right, all right.
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
MOOPS
You already got it.
Yada yada yada...
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
So?
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
Not exactly. What does that mean?
Oh great.
Alright, tell her. Go ahead.
What?
Hi. George.
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
You didn't like it?
Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
And I am not a piece of toast.
This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
You're kidding.
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
Really?
Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
Rosses.
(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
You think I'm going down?
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
Yeah. Just confirming.
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
(worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
Its over.
Did you just say vault?
Hey, frolf?
14 months. Maybe 10.
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?
Water. Need some water! Water here!
(sobbing) yodel lay hee hoo..
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
Have to give him time on this hour.
You enjoying yourself? (More laughs from Elaine)
Yeah. It doesn't make any difference.
Right now?
(panicking) Right, I knew I felt something!
No. Rice and caramel.
No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
Maybe it was a mouse.
But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
Huh?
(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
That's right.
Sounds like a rough trip.
91 dollars.
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
No..
Shes right above you?
Yeah, me too...
I didn't take it, yet.
Purple 23.
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
Hi.
Susan wants me to be there.
What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
Ooh, so what?
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
Oh!
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
You got aloe? I love aloe.
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
Yeah, phew.
My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
Do you believe this guy?
What are you, crazy? You were fine.
Yeah.
(holds eyes wide open) Get it back!
No, no...I hate the condom.
So it's just mono.
So uh... been to a bris before?
Jerry, what are you doing...
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
That's right, no discount!
No we're not.
(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
Hey.
Rick.
Of course he liked it.
And God didn't kill me.
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
Who?
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
Is it with a "y"?
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
How are you closer to him than me?
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
Why not?
Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
Hey
All right, what are we doing?
Haven't we had this conversation before?
No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
Brown.
What's desert?
I know, I know, thats what they said.
Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer...
Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
You got isobutane-30?
But suddenly, a new contender has emerged...
Yes, a rosy glow.
I think I like the girl better than the voice.
Oh, no.
He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
I still paid for it!
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
So I spoke to the security guard.
What's that?
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
Warning signs?
No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.
Yeah. You've heard of it?
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
Maybe he's, um... mixed.
It's my space!
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
...neither am I.
Fifteen seconds.
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
Yeah, come on.
(Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..
FINE? WHAT SIZE?
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
Why don't you just call 911?
Right above you?
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
Yearn? Do I yearn?
Hey, uh...
Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
So, what're you saying?
How would I know?
Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
Nah, I don't like that one.
Ok, so, what'dya got?
No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
Pick it up, pick it up!
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
What *kind* of a person are you?
Yeah, she's quite a character.
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
Me neither. I've never been happy.
I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
Personal matter.
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
I know enough to stay away from it.
He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
Oh, the hamstrings fine.
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
(joyful) June. It's June.
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
No.
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
She any good?
I'm moving to California.
Hello?
Yes, I have a problem with paba.
Me, uh, uh, no, ...
Why? What do you mean?
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
I'm sorry sir.
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
Oh. (he stands there)
Yes you did!
What?
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
(eager) So? What d'you think?
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.
All right.
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
No! Absolutely Not!
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
Oh no, thank you.
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
Your own show?
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
Ahhh. How does this thing work?
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
I'd like to be able to get it out.
I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
This is it?
See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
He did that?
