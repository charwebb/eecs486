With all due respect, I don't think so...
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
So how do you want to do this?
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
What do I do?! What do I do?!
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
How do you know it was her dude?
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
No...Why should that make any difference to you?
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
No, no, she might just think its a gift.
Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!
All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
Because I uh, I told her the truth.
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
What do you know? You were in the nut house.
He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
You never had sex in the office before?
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.
So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
We could be zipping all over the place.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
Because you called her by the wrong name.
Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
I told you, he probably went out the back.
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
What are you gonna do with all of them?
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
No I, I want it if you dont want it.
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
She must have seen me eating it on TV.
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
