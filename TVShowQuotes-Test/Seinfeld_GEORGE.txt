You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
You hear the way he talks to me?
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
Well, I didn't want to break our date.
Because you called her by the wrong name.
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
Then I got off the phone right away.
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
He got about uh, two inches from... there.
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
You really think this looks O.K. on me?
I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
I guess you two are the lucky ones.
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.
Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
[pause] Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I, I'm fighting not to. Fighting! Unfortunately I uh have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta' get up and hit that pavement
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
All right, I want you to do me a favor.
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
I can never get the package open in time.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
You only think that because you know me.
I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom.
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
So what do you care what she thinks.
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
Dont you think you get more without it?
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
Wow,  god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
What kind of money you think your parents have?
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?
(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
Well I can't break up with her now.
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out. BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
What do you think about a rocking chair?
Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
She happens to be very good friends with her.
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
What did I get or what do I say I got?
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
I have to talk to you about something .
So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
