Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
You hear the way he talks to me?
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
So what, what is so bad about that?
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
I dont know how you put up with this.
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
You came to see me. I work in the building.
What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.
Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
What kind of money you think your parents have?
You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
Let me just see it for a second.
I have an aunt that died at seven.
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
What difference does it make what she looks like?
You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?
Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
Out of the question. Out of the question!
You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!
Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
(Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.
Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
She wants me to take an IQ test.
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
With all due respect, I don't think so...
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
I know I was just telling them the story.
The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
I know, I know, thats what they said.
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
All right, I want you to do me a favor.
It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
So you - you really don't have my hat?
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
"Hey you know , I felt we had like a synergy out there,you know, like we were really helping each other."
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
The rule is a minimum of two days.
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
Well, it's . . . much too low.
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
I don't know what the reason could be.
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
I think I like the girl better than the voice.
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
