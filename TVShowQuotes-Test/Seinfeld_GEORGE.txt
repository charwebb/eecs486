Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
I mean I'm the one who bought it.
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
You think she would care about the red dot?
Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
Why did France give that to us anyway?
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
You put a hot tub... in your living room?
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
Have to give him time on this hour.
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
The nice one that works in my office.
(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!
Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
Does the heater even work in this car?
. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
What if I want to walk around a little?
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
All right, I want you to do me a favor.
Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?
(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?
(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
(Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.
You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.
He said he didn't know what it was.
What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
I think they really went for that Soda.
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
No, no I do. You know it's just...
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
So what, what is so bad about that?
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
How about the old Spider Man live action show?
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
How could it still smell after all that?
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
What do I do?! What do I do?!
you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
I can't believe I get paid for this.
Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
[pause] Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I, I'm fighting not to. Fighting! Unfortunately I uh have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta' get up and hit that pavement
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
How come you don't know what street are you on?
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
Well what would I say in the note?
(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
Not a bad way to make a buck.
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
Then I got off the phone right away.
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.
(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
