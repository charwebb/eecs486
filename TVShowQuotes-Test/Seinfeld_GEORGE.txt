Yes, yes, I am.
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
You're smart, I'm dumb.
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
Well, we really should be-
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
Oh my god....
Yes. Well...
GUILTY!
That's good, we'll give it a try...
Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
Allow me. Why?
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
Party?
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
She is a good waitress.
O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.
We...must never ever speak of this again..
I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
No. During.
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
You better call her.
Alright, let's go.
Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
You mean that's true, I'm right?!
What are you worried about, you know it.
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
Hey, me too.
...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.
Like who?
I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.
Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
(Disappointed) A frog?
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
I have a ten.
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
I don't know.
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
How would I know?
I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
Ya, you go.
Nothing...little problem.
Vinyl yeah, maybe.
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
oh Tony don't
Fish. What do they do?
Taste this, is this a dill?
What trying to get off the phone?
(scream) Jerry!!
I don't know if you're ready for it.
No, I uh... I use it.
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?
Oh, he stole it!
What?
(yells) I didn't tattle
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.
Hey!.. What can I tell ya.
So?
Where?
Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
(modest) And I'm a little tired.
Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
So it was a good experience.
What does she look like?
One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.
I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
What's for supper?
Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.
You uh owe me for the ticket.
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
All right, OK, I'm goin' in.
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
Of course, right.
Boy, these really do pinch the nose.
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
All right I gotta get going.
Officer, he can't pull in head first.
What do you wanna do?
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
Si, si.
Oh my god.
But I'm not a marine biologist!
What happened?
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
What's that?
(To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
Four hours.
So?
What, you think I could postpone it?
(to Jerry) Dont you find that strange?
How many tickets are you paying today?
Man, I'm starving.
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
Pop? What happened to Pop?
(casually) Sure, why not.
(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
Remember, dont take any crap.
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
They're breaking up? How do you know?
The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
No?
Okay, I mean it's serious but--
Yeah haha.
Well, I'm sorry!
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.
Yeah, it's her uncle's.
Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.
You did all this...for a pinky toe?
No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
I would imagine it's all naked.
Well, it's . . . much too low.
Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
Where we gonna eat?
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
What?
All right... here goes...
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
No.
But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?
I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
Well why didn't we?
What is he talking about?
From me.
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
We get to go to the opera together!
(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
Noo!
Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
I thought you meant the..
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
(pleading) Alright..
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
Not in the last fifteen minutes.
Maybe Im right? Of course Im right.
Big fan! Big fan.
It's June.Mark's Michelle is a dog.
Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
Yes, as I see it.
Gimme the purse!
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles)
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
Hey.
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
This is Morning Mist.
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
All bald people look good in hats.
What? Where are you going?
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
Well...Susan.
Just like that.
Really?
(to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?
What do you think it's a bomb?
Ask about you, ask about you.
(sitting down) Where's Hanke?
(leaps to feet) Jerry!
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
Obviously.
I like it!
Hand sandwich.
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
You sure?
I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
Stacey.
Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
(leaving) Hah. Good luck.
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
Yeah, they're not better than me.
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
Please, it's--
Ya
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
Must be hell living in that house.
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
What do you mean "into the patient"?
If only something like that could happen to me.
So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
No.
Who's Sid?
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
Hey.
Oh, ... some stupid movie...
Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
Ah ah Pez dispenser.
Ill have the tuna.
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
Ah, Oh boy.
It looks like it hasn't been washed.
HI ELAINE...
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
What's up?
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
(still quiet) The actress.
WOW!
Hate the big coarse "ha." Hate those.
I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
Oh, they're busting!
Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
You miss her, don't you?
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
She ate breakfast naked?
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
Maybe I won't send her that check.
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
I have an idea.
"step off"?
...she calls me up at my office
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
You do?
(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
Oh, the actress-waitress?
First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
Jerry, what are you doing...
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
Yeah. Why, what do you do?
Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
No we're not.
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?
Okay. That's what we know.
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
I know.
Congratulations...congratulations.
Did she say why?
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
I didn't get the job?
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?
Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.
Nice day today.
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
To ask her out.
Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.
George, how you doing?
Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
Why?
(Confused) What photo?
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
"These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"
This is gonna be fun.
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
I feel fat.
So, she doesnt move in.
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
Really?
I'll take one. It's possible.
What a mind.
Was it my fault?
I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
Huge matzoh ball.
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
It's not funny, Elaine.
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
(laughs) Not quite.
Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
You hear the way he talks to me?
What?
I think so.
(to Jerry) Yeah, your milk.
Too much salt in my diet.
"You sell them?"
Why did you give him my ticket for?
You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.
Where are you sitting?
Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
What's the decision?
So ... uh, squirrel.
I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Time?
Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.
Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
....But after that we really talked didn't we?
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
(backing off) Huh? All right, fine.
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
B-O-Z-O?
I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?
Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
(hopeful) Everything?
Right.
Any money in it?
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
Can you uh, go in the bubble?
How much you pay this maid?
No, of course not. I didnt-
(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
Well um, what about tomorrow night?
(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
I didn't take it, yet.
I don't have a hi-fi.
It's baffling, isn't it?
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
Oh! no no nothing....
What?
Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
Uh huh.
(broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!
Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.
How could I possibly interfere?
No doors?
Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
What happened? Where have you been?
We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
Fantastic day! Fantastic!
I have an aunt that died at seven.
So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
Seven forty-five.
(to Jerry) Hey.
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
Do women know about shrinkage?
No kidding?
Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
Why?
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
I don't understand women.
So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
Mick Jagger.
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
How is this effeminate?
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
Who?
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
You mean she just laid there topless?
He..he wants to talk to me?
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
Really good looking?
Wow
(shouting) Get your Paliachi!
Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!
Like what?
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
Elaine
...Six wrong?
YYYDDSSHE(?) ... Jose Jimenez. You recognize it?
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
I'm still watching them.
Movies. I like to watch movies.
Cleaning
Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
I don't know, I didn't ask.
Elaine! (shouts) ELAINE!!
(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
What about me?
That's right.
Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
You just hesitated.
You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
You thought she was good looking, right?
(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer.
No, that's the Netherlands.
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
Hey could you do one other thing for me?
. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
Hi,
Wow. Nice.
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
Oh good.
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
Well, how about that?
Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink.
What's that.
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
They're cuffing him.
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
Ah, come on!
Susan loves the sponge.
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
Is that common in our family?
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
No problem.
And if I don't call...
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
What, you should've just asked her.
But I had no... I didn't realize.
It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
(Interrupting) May I?
Find a job. Get an apartment.
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
Why don't we talk about it another time.
Wow, is she not terrific?
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
Remember when you came to audition for us?
You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
No.
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
That's because it's underwater.
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
Hm?
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
(entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
Well, I don't really like her.
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
I told you, he probably went out the back.
No, no she wasn't.
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
I didn't know she took it!
I'd rather go to a hanging.
No, Newman, stop it.
(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
Fifteen seconds.
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
Peter Jennings had one.
Yes.
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
Like what?
You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?
Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
Boy, that was awkward!
Oh my God!
What happened to the auto show?
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
Because, you're not a dermatologist.
My Susan?
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
No, no! You can't throw me out
Well... it's a magnificent stone.
How do you know it was her dude?
Well I gotta go talk to Beth.
Ooh!
Yeah, she's quite a character.
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
Yeah. Let's go.
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
hey nice move today
So you lied to her?
Yes.
I got a source.
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
Hello-o-o-o Elaine!
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
A bench? What kind of a bench?
Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
So.....She's dead?
I still paid for it!
A billiard parlor?
No.
(feigning happiness) The second I see him.
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
I didn't know he'd get fired.
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.
Singapore?! Do you hear this?
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
Why does she want you to be mad?
Hey, what are you doing?
Wha?
Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
I bet they have more money than mine.
They asked you to do career day?
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
No?
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
Yes I did.
Don't leave (George slams the door)
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
(On the other line) Hey.
Koko.
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
Hey di ho
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
Bob Cobb?
You see... All right I knew it.
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
That's right. I'm two in the hole!
Yes I do.
She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
All right, all right.
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
Seven-eight-four.
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
No, anything.
Okay.
You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
Oh yeah.
Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
Three pints of Kramer's blood?
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
Our show, "Jerry"?
Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!
Was this something you had planned for a while?
Rick.
Just take the cap off!
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
Heard that one already.
Haven't we had this conversation before?
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
Hello?
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
You will?
He massacred you.
Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
It's the same movie! What's the difference?
Yeah.
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
It varies.
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
Ah! There's mom, there's mom.
Shortness of breath..
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
Excuse me.
It's my father's car!
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
Ahh. Good for you.
(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
Sorry. Thank you.
(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
Exactly.
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
Twenty years? That long?
Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
No complaints.
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
Well...
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
I guess it's on my resume.
She's bluffing...
It's my only hope.
My hand is out.
(Interrupting) Jerry, No!
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
Yea, well, maybe some parts.
La-la-la...
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
Yeah.
(disappointment) Oh. Course not.
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
Oh, so it backfired?
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
JODI! (he starts running after her)
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
He asked me to keep it a secret.
Ah, enjoying them?
Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script)
Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
It seemed so disorganized.
So are they coming tonight or not?
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
That's why they gave you the apartment?
What are you, a doctor?
He he...So huh! What's with the suitcase.
(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
Hello..
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
Hey, what's your guy's name again?
It's coming Jerry, it's coming.
So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
Pull it up a little bit.
Nothing!
Day was -
Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
It's about nothing.
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
(to Elaine) You dont tip a gardener!
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
It's nothing.
Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
(hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
(pleased) I know.
You heard him.
how did ya?...
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
What?
She told you she doesn't like me!
Still a little summer left.
That guy is not blind.
So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
The guy playing Kramer threatened me.
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
Doesn't she have collision?
What were her exact--
Hey Glenn!
Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.
I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
Now Im in the worst position of all.
Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
Yes.
Me, uh, uh, no, ...
(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
I'm sorry sir.
Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
Who was it?
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
Waffle maker.
You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
What?
How could you not know her name?
Just CALL!
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
...thirty-two, thirty-three-
Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
Beautiful.
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
The woman we bought the wheelchair for?
Who are you to decide?
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
You're sleepin' with the maid?
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
Maybe Karen is faking.
I'M NOT A LIER!
How ya doin'?
uh oh..
In a manner of speaking.
Hey.
Yes.
This is what I'm talking about.
Id love to go. Make an appointment.
Morning, ma.
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
Oh I don't know. Check this out.
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
Shadow!
Laundry? Dry cleaning?
Yeah, it's the last one.
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
When did you get this idea?
He has no home. He's a squirrel.
Oh man.
Where, where? I can't see.
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
I can't say.
(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
Dont you wanna go upstairs first?
I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
It's alright, I got lunch.
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
So, what did she say?
Hey.
Very nice
Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
I didn't even know it was a job.
Yeah.. They made me sick.

(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.

(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!

Yeah. So how does that help me?
What about me?
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)

Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!

You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.

(Modestly) Forget it.
'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
