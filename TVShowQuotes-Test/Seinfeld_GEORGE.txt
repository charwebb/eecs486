Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
What do you think about a rocking chair?
Those were her exact words, I like George.
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
So what do you want me to do?
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
You never had sex in the office before?
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
He said he didn't know what it was.
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
Do I really have to buy her something?
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
What kind of a shake does he have?
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
Not a bad way to make a buck.
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
What do we have in the fruit department?
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
I know, I know, thats what they said.
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect.
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
