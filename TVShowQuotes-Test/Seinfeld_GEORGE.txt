George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
You never should have taken away his keys!
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
I think I had some hard candy in there.
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
You don't think I can keep a secret?
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
What do you think about a rocking chair?
Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
huh Kramer it's huh.. gonna be pretty dangerous up there
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
The rule is a minimum of two days.
Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
No, no I do. You know it's just...
Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
You don't have to pay for the massage?
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
I think they really went for that Soda.
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
We cant just let him get away with this.
Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
I know, I know, thats what they said.
Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?
Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
How many people does he do that for?
Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
What kind of money you think your parents have?
Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
I heard they found a family in your freezer
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
I think she wants me to take her home.
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
So what do you want me to do?
(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
Have to give him time on this hour.
"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
How do you know it was her dude?
Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
Well do you want me to take it off?
I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
I don't know what the reason could be.
You're not going to get back here in time!
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
