Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
