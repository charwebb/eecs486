The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
Kind of embarassing.
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
Thank you.
What?
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
Hello, hello.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
[Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo!
Yes.
I'll take him.
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
Ho-ho!
[watching you tube video, laughing]
Here you go.
Yeah.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
[to Jim] What are you doing?
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
I worked at a Jiffy Lube.
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
Loyalty.
Thank you.
[sighs] Dinkin' flicka.
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
I... I just thought you knew me.
You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
Oh yeah.
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
Bang.
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
Rachel from the party?
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
That was cold.
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Yeah.
Things? People?
Great.
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Um, where did you get that story?
Oh yeah.
To push this bar up.
Mike.
Rosebud?
No, um... I have.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
Help me!
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Close the door.
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
I got that cutie behind the counter.
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
Oh my goodness.
J-j-j-ju...
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
He does not like that wall.
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
Fun.
Block, block, block!
That was you.
You missed a spot.
She did?
Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
I don't understand the point of a hat.
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
That felt really good, actually.
Hey, let's call this what it is.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
Yep. Take care.
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
Right in here?
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
That's what I'm talking about!
I got it. I'm doin' it.
Thanks, man.
Mike you'll drive this every weekend?
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
I included some time saving ideas...
Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
It's real bad.
Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!
There you go.
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
[sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
What's it say?
