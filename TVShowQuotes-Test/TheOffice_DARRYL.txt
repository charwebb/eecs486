Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
This is not a good idea right here.
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
I was in The Whiz in high school.
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
