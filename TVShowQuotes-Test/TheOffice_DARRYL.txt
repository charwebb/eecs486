What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
Oh, don't worry about it.
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
That was definitely not dancing.
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
Andy, who punched you?
Yeah.
I'll be there.
Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.
What's up man?
Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.
Ahem!
You ready for me?
Alright, yeah fine so whatever...
Please call me back.
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
C'mon Gwenneth.
No.
To push this bar up.
What are you doing here, Gabe?
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Who cares?
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
We're loading at one.
Get under your chin first. Yeah.
What?
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
Yeah.
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
It was in the box.
Is that grease on my floor?
Oh, ok.
Four hours. Almost halfway there.
I shall come by at your convenience.
Oh yeah.
I'm good.
That was a triple.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
Then why did you say 'Jackson Five?'
No. No.
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
I don���t do that anymore.
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
I wouldn't enjoy that.
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
I'm not mad. Are you mad?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
Hey Mike, do my thing.
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
Got it.
Yeah, we're going to get clobbered.
That's a great plan.
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
Good luck to you.
I haven't hired anyone.
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Why would you think a lady is me?
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
No do not touch it!
OK.
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
It's getting bigger.
Mm, it's not that big.
There's other pencil's in this office.
What's something you really care about?
It's all good, we got this.
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
Hey, how'd you do?
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
I thought that was your job.
Why can't I just... tell you?
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
I did.
Thanks, man.
It says decaf. You get me decaf?
Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
It is worth it.
Why?
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
A buyout.
Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
You done?
Why do you wanna work here?
Start over.
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
Way
[clears throat]
I got that cutie behind the counter.
Yo.
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
I know, I know. It's just hard.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
Goodnight.
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
You just said you hated it.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
Did you hire 'em?
What?
Uh, 'The moon is huge tonight.'
[laughs] Are you serious?  You're earning this?
You're the tutorial.
Dwight?
So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
