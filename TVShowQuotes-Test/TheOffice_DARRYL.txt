Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
You feel connected to his baby over there?
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
