[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
I don't understand the point of a hat.
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
