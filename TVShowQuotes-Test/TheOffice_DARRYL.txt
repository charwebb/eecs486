One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
