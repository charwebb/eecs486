I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
The coconut's pretty subtle.
[trying not to laugh] Okay.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.
Cool.
Hey.
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
C'mon Gwenneth.
We should play it.
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
All right. Thanks, man.
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
How much did you pay for that?
[laughs] That's a text. [high fives Andy]
I'm out. And so is Toby.
Eat. It.
Thanks T-Man, later.  [fist bumps Toby}
No. No.
Do you understand that?
Go, Dwight Jr!
Why can't I just... tell you?
You popped one kernel.
Clever, Mike.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
You gotta include me in the conversation.
OK.
Yeah.
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
Actually, you did.
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
It is worth it.
You want to dance?
Oh?
They have fast food in Philly.
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
All right, let���s get this over with.
What up?
What's under your shirt?
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
How do I do that?
What?
She's got a boyfriend.
OK, don't fire me.
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
Snap, for real?
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
Oh, don't worry about it.
I got Source Code on the way back.
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
She did?
[holding camera] Here we go.
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
This trip was longer than I thought.
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
I don't understand the point of a hat.
More universal.
I find you absolutely ribbiting!
He's got to go, Mike.
[laughs] Are you serious?  You're earning this?
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
Nice scatting, man.
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
What? You making bread?
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
Sure, sweetie.
Condoms.
This party���s tight.  The fog is cool.
That's not a good reason.
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
Something full of acid.
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
Yes sir. Thanks.
I got it. I'm doin' it.
What have you done for me?
But we get paid a lot less.
Yes.
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
You should stop calling yourself 'baby daddy.'
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
Alright.
Yeah.
[Sitting outside building] Stop.
This is what you want?
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
Everybody got a government cow.
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Who knew, right?
This is gonna make him feel better.
Congratulations, baby!
How about the sales department is the sails?
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
Like what?
Oh, hey. Hey, what���s up, y���all?
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
I thought that was your job.
I agree. I think it's superb.
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Jim really doesn���t want to come?
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Oh my goodness.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?
This is the last of it.
