We're tryin' to get Bebe to run for class president.
I don't know, it's just a cool costume.
Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!
Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?
Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?
She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. 
Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. 
What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? 
Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?
We're just having a hard time finding him.
Right this way!  You can't eat in the cafeteria!
