Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?
I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.
You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bullcrap bullying video!
Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.
I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
From the nice guy at the county fair.
Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?
Ah, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.
You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 
Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?
