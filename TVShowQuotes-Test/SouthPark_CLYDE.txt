You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!

Oh, now what?

Why?

For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! 

Oh.  Cool! He's here! 

Where did they get that thing? 

Oh, no!

I wanna go again. I wanna go again!

But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.

Whoa.  Is that Wendy Testaburger? 

Wow wee. 

Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.

Oh boy here we go!

A toilet?

I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
