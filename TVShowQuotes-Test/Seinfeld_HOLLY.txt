I'm sorry.
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
I can imagine.
You still gonna be mean to me?
Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
You will.
You're crazy, go crazy.
There's too much distance.
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
Oh.
No, this is Michael Scott.
Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
Yeah.
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Do you need some help?
Not bad.
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
What am I saying?
Oh, good.
Good.

Oh that is so sweet.
[to Toby] What did you do to him?
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
Get a life!
Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
Nope.
[imitates a squeaky bed] [laughter]
I don't think we could enforce that.
A little lower.
I'm from da future.
What's up?
Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know.
I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
[shakes head] No more.
[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.
Here you go.
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
Dieting's only half of it.
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Yeah?
Thanks.
[Brooklyn accent] You ahh.
Ahoy.
It'll probably be a total disaster, but...
Don't you have a sales call to go on?
Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?
Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
Mh hmm.
