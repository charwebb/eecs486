I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! 
Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!
My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!
Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!
There must be clubs like this all over the world.
So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.
