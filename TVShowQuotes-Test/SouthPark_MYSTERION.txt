You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?

Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!

Come back, you fat piece of shit! 

Tell me what that means! 

You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?

This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-

But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.

Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.

So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.

It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember!
