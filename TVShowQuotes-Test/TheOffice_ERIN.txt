So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It���s a��� ���Mageddon!���
Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
And then we had him ���Like��� Dunder Mifflin.
[to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
So far, we���re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
You have to change the channel to PBS.
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
Oh well, Andy, we���re not moving to Cornell.
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
[accent] Savannah?  That's a far way from Scranton.
Andy���s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy���s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy���s here. Pam, he���s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
Wait, why do you have to record it?
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
Wow.  I���m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I���ll see you guys.
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
