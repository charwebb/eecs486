[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
[accent] Of course, Nathaniel.
I'm in.
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
Oh, assist.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Oh.
Uh...
Uh-oh! [laughs, they drive away]
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
But why not find out.
It's about you.
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
Those posters used to be real French ads.
He didn't even say that.
I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Wow.  I���m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I���ll see you guys.
Oh.
[doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
[blocks Holly's path] No.
Pam gave it to me!
Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
No, you stop.
Get out of here!
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Oh, uhm, like three months.
Ok.
What about Kelly?
We have our decision.
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
Ooh. Wait, Michael?
Wait. Why?
Everyday is fine.  Or...
No.
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
Thank you.
[giggles] Terrific!
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we���re not really friends.
Hello.
Dwight gives the best back massages.
Mm. [Chuckles]
We are closed! Come on.
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
[gasps] Hello, waffle iron.
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
What is that supposed to mean?
Hey.
Do you want me to go back to the store?
Okay.
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
Hmm.
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
Copy that.
He only emailed me four times.
Really?
Did you grow up around here?
Yeah!
Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.
Aw!
Hanks.
No, I���m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It���s not like that at all! Forget it, I���m so sorry.
We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
Michael, people are asking questions.
Who���s calling?
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Do you even know what you're doing?
I couldn't do it.
I don't want you to shave everything.
It���s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
Justine.  She said she���s coming by later.
[laughs] That's my favorite.
Here we go.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
You tricked me!
Just the two of us.
I did. I got some really good sleep.
Hey.
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It���s a��� ���Mageddon!���
Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex?
You named them?
Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
But, there's no clue.
We should do something.
I've been turned into a puppet!
Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
Nothing, I just-
Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
What?
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ���slave master���, ���attafrauk!���, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.
[face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh...
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
I don't know.
[clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar]
I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
They had sex?
Oh.
I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.
Andy.
No.
No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
No.
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
Oh, thanks. Come in!
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
Ukulele's happy?
Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
So tell me about your new girlfriend.
Foth aggendak!
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
Retail consumer habits.
Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly.
It's so edgy!
Hey! Gabe.
Ohh. [laughs]
Sponge.
Foth aggendi!
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Absolutely. Works for me.
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
Where did he go, Holly?
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
Ah! Angela had the baby!
Hi Michael. [gives him a hug]
It's right here in PA.
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl���
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.'
