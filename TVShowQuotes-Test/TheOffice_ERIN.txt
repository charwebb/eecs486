She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
And then we had him ���Like��� Dunder Mifflin.
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so���
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
Did it affect you outside of the office?
Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
Ok.  Let���s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just��� more adult��� more���  scary and sexy
Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
Wait, why do you have to record it?
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you���re here?
We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don���t.�� And I don���t.�� But I am so excited to be a part of it.
I know this is going to be a great payoff.
Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.'  Should I delete all of those?
