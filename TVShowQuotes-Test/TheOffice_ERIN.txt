Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
It was Andy, wasn't it?
Oh, I���m sorry. Didn���t you cheat on Andy?
Did you write this?
Kelly got into the minority training program.
Why's it so far away?
I haven't seen it.
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
He���s absolutely right. I���m really struggling.
This fax came for you. [Coughs]
Ok.
Good morning.
So far, we���re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
Gabe!
[gets up] Oh.
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
Oh, boy!  ...  What's that sound?
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
No, I don't have any stuff.
It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
No. No more talking. It's movie time.
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Hi.
Wait which one?
Oh yeah. What else you got?
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Oh.
Yes?
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
Yes.
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
You can actually stop.
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
Okay, okay.
So, I'm Erin. Hi.
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Pam gave it to me!
Wow. That guy���s really into paper.
How are you? How's your family doing?
Oh!
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Let's do it!
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
Yeah Jim! [Group claps]
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
This is all I could find.
He sounds like an idiot.
Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!
Well I have an idea.
Dwight gives the best back massages.
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
Oh, uhm, like three months.
Andy.
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
Andy, I care about you and I think--
Oh, like a goodbye trip.
We have our decision.
Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
Super romantic.
Do you even know what you're doing?
One more?
Right, yes.
Thank you, goodnight.
I���m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called ���pecker Poker���.  [fighting tears] It���s the game of cards that gets you hard.
Okay.
Okay.
Thanks.
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
Yes. So do I.
[whispers] It's the fuzz!
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
Why wouldn't he tell me that?
Oh, my God. It's a song.
Who's hungry?
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
Andy!
Yes! [Group cheers]
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
The movies. I don't know.
Maybe, ok? Let me think about it.
That it'll be the first shipment out today.
Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Hey.
Andy!
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
Oh just by like friends.
Yeah.
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
Hey.
Nice.
Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
None of this makes any sense to me!
Did it affect you outside of the office?
[laughing] Yeah.
Okay.
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
Ashley! You made it!
No, come on.
Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.
[speaking in French] S���il vous plait���dites-Moi���Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.
I don���t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone���s trust. About the pens.
Yeah I love that.
Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
I think he's around here...
But... they're penises.
I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
Oh.
I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ���What's your stance on politics?��� Or, ���What is the best war to do?��� And, I will just be like, ���Duhhhh!���
Okay...
I know. That���s great. It just - it makes it look like there���s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
All that color.
Oh god.
Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
The tea in Nepal is very hot.
No.
Interesting.
Unplanned pregnancy.
���Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.���
Just the two of us.
Next!
