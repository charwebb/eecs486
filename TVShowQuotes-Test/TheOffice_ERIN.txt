Thanks, Michael.
Maybe, ok? Let me think about it.
I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
It's about you.
Wait which one?
That's crazy.
You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Yes.
How���s Florida?
Hey, Dwight Snoot.
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
Clark's a dead man.
What? Why are we-
What is with these turkeys?
Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
I know. You get to pick.
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
I've heard that's amazing when it works.
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
Yes, but I'm terrible at math so...
[gets up] Oh.
Your hand's cold.
Movie is starting.
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
Really? Because your mother is dead.
No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'
I'm in.
Hmm.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
OK. [takes shot, group laughs]
Sorry.
I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
Oh. Hey, champions.
Hi.
I really love your outfit.
How are you? How's your family doing?
[whining] What?
Oh.
Darryl.
Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
You're up.
You have a cool place to come hang.
Haho!
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon.
Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Fire him. No, show mercy.
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
A lot of fun.
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
[Laughs and shrieks]
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
Good me too!
Who���s calling?
I would have chosen the 1490's.
No, I���m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It���s not like that at all! Forget it, I���m so sorry.
[looking disheveled] Hey.
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
[tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
Ok.  Let���s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just��� more adult��� more���  scary and sexy
Gee, he was salty.
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
Okay.
Are you alright?
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!
[blocks Holly's path] No.
I did. I got some really good sleep.
Wah!! Aggenda!!
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it���s in order? I [laughs] haven���t been trained for this.
You promised!
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day?  There's a bunch of those.
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
Nothing, I just-
Why would I hide it! [giggling]
Yeah.
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
Michael!
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
Hi Dwight!
No.
[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'
Yeah!
Yes?
He's my foster brother.
And, you're my friend.
OK.
Hi, guys. How you doing?
Really. It's not a big deal.
A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn���t bad.
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
Oh, yeah. [gives him a quick kiss]
Colder.
I guess we don���t have a choice.
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
[gasps]
Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.
Phyllis!
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
Sure.
Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
It���s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
She wandered off like an idiot.
Exactly.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
They said the both of you.
Oh it's... [points to conference room]
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Yeah, he is!
I bet. You guys.
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that���s the end of it. Right, Pete?
Oh. [liquid splatters]
[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
Okay, let's hear it.
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
I hate it! I hate your car!
