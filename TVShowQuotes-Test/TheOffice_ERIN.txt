Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh��� guh.
Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
Do you want me to go back to the store?
I wish I had seen you do it.
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn���t stupid.
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.'  Should I delete all of those?
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
This isn���t one of those times. It���s the police. They said it���s the worst they���ve ever seen.
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
I didn't know we had a tape measure.
See? I bet you wouldn���t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
