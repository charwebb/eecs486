Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Yeah, seriously, it���s like everything on there is work.
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn't.
I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
Well, it���s addressed to Customer Service so, it���s your mail.
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Hey! You better do ���Faith.��� You get me?
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause]
[clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar]
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I���m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
I want to continue working on our friendship.
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Wallace is on the phone.  He's returning your call.
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
[tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That���s what happened. The pens happened.
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we���re not really friends.
Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
