Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
You have to change the channel to PBS.
It���s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
[speaking in French] S���il vous plait���dites-Moi���Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
I didn't know we had a tape measure.
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
I���m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called ���pecker Poker���.  [fighting tears] It���s the game of cards that gets you hard.
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They���re family-owned, but don���t let that take away from your edge!
So far, we���re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
I bet it���s Katie Couric. I���ve been saying this for years.
Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.
Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl���
I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.
That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
Wallace is on the phone.  He's returning your call.
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
Andy���s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy���s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy���s here. Pam, he���s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
She���s dead. She was hit by a bus.
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
