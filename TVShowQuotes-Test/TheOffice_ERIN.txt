Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
No ��� just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don���t want to leave yet. I haven���t had so much fun since seeing��� zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I���m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
I did. I got some really good sleep.
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ���Do yes disturb meditations of horror��� appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
Didn���t you get the memo? It���s Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Pete and I work well together -- not that there���s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I���m into girls. Not that I���m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Hey, my name���s Tabitha. I���m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It���s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it���s working. There���s already people camped out behind me.
Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ���coffee������.
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
