Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!

Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.

Herro, crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton, Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam.  Earlier today, a break in the beaver dam which protected the town broke open, trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives. 

Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there.

By the way, did you ever see that movie Contact? 

I ate all mine up, silly.

Thanks, Edward, that's a very shocking report...

Well of course he's imaginary!

You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!
