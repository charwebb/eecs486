In the nearby town of South Park, the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated.

...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries.

The operation is over, Mr. Garrison.

Alrighty then, let's get started! 

At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break, but now, shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in Beaverton was caused by... global warming!  It now appears that... all rumors of global warming were true. We were warned this would happen and ...we didn't listen!  We didn't listen!  All the top Colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting.

Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir.

Alright-y then.  Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.

Niles Lawson is on the scene, and Niles, what are you hearing?

'Cause sometimes, girls who aren't well-liked, you know, lash out at pretty and popular girls. Are, are you well-liked at your school?
