Team B? Come in, Team B.

Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked.  Metaphorically speaking, that is.

I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.

Kenny! Nnnoooooo!

Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl.

As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny.

Over there!  Another wet willie?

Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all.

It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough.

Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease. 

What the hell is going on?

Uhhhâ€¦

Push, now. Push hard!  Oh my God. 

Stan?

What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant!
