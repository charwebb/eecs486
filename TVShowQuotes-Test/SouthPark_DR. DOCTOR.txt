What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant!

We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.

Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.

You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time.

It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?

Oh, yes. Where is Stan?

It's his time. It's ...running out.

Why, hello there, Eric. 

Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!

He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.

There there now, it's not your fault.
