You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick.  It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life. 

It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.  I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side. 

We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.

My God, that's a hell of a storm. 

Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl.

Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach.

Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist. 

Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays.

Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma.

It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.
