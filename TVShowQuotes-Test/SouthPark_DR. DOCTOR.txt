We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!  Oh, sorry.
I'm going to prescribe a laxative.  But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful.
Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die.
Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated. 
He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine.
No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment.
Jesus Christ.  What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup.
Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in.
He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while.
