It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now.
Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact,  there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle.
There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of. 
He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine.
It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy.
From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride.
We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs.
Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated.
