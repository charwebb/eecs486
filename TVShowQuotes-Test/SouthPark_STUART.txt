I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.

What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! 

No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.

Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids-- 

Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.

Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! 

Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny!
