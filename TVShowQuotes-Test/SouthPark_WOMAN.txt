Yeah, let's get this party started. 

Who is that lady?

Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby. 

Oh he's such a happy little Mexican. 

Everything all right, Fred?

Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!

Whoa

Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.

Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!

What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?!  Window. Window.

But-

How about fifteen dollars?

Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus.  Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely?  No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them.  Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19.  Come on, remember : reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food.  Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? 

...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm...

Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope.

We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?

Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.

No, please!

Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?

Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!
