Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus.  Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely?  No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them.  Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19.  Come on, remember : reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food.  Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? 
Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.
Uh, what are you going to do to us??
I just clicked "Agree." I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!
Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads. 
Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.
You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi! 
Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!
