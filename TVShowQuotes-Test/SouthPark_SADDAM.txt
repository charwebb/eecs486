Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?

COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  Â¡Me gusta burrito mucho!

Nothing! Relax, brother.

Let me in where? 

Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?

A walk?

Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
