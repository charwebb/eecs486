Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?

Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!

Here, have another drink. 

Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us.  You can try, but you know we belong together.

Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.

A walk?

And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought you a potato. 

Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?
