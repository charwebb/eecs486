No!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?! 

Put it out! Put it out!

Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?

Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.

That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!

What happened to him, Doctor?

Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?! 

Damn, I hate those stupid richers!
