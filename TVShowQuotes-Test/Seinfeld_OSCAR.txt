Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.
Why'd you say dollars?
I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
That sounds fake.
Time's almost up. How many are left?
Because I don't want my benefits slashed.
All I need is another gym. As if I don���t have enough drama.
Just go down, Kevin.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'
I'm just curious.
He���s fine.
Narddog. [throws Andy a can]
No one else in this office is gay.
TV.
We have missiles too.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You���re not gay.
You have a brother?
Him? Him?
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
Do you not own a mirror?
How mean are we talking about?
What is this about?
Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.
Um..
Yes! The freaking PDA!
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
You owe me and apology.
Hey, no.
More like fall cleaning. [chuckles]
What?
I guess so.
$50,000?
When is the funeral?
Hoop it up, right.
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
That���s���that���s awful, Angela. I���m so sorry.
It's not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
What are you implying?
Michael? Poor Richard's?
Guys! Over here, we found the bus.
You suppose?
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
okay
The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
Michael left.
Here are our final actual costs for this year.
I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
Donate to the charity?
How does it end?
Eh.
I think you don't know what you're saying.
He did it himself.
Settle down gentlemen.
She's always late, she's always rude...
How old is she?
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
Aw.
So you have an extra dollar.
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
Andy.
Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
Dwight!
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Who?
[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'
And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
Well, if there���s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I���[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don���t we move the copier into the annex like we���ve always wanted to?
I think that's it!
If you don't mind me asking---
Totally, that's great.
Congratulations.  That's great.
No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
That's great.
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
Angela, it���s a lead freaking pipe.
He���s making a phone call.
...I'll do it.
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Really?
[buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
Good luck!
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
Angela! [whispering] Angela. There.
Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
Definitely no.
Kevin, no.
[clears throat]
A real David and Goliath story.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
Hey, everyone.
You call him!
So Michael, what do you think?
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
She got pregnant before the wedding.
Kevin, move. I can���t pull up the rug if you���re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
To both these bears.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.
[sighs] Oh my God.
It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
Ok, that's a joke.
What is first base with Angela?
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Why did Binghamton close?
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
You're not sure that you have the job.
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
Why don't we make corn burgers?
Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
How 'bout, she takes it down?
You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
Ok, I���ve got my���
Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
Elliot!
Try another sentence.
What the hell, Dwight?
Where'd you get that kind of money?
Why?
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
What are you doing?
That's... that's... that's very generous.
He knew!
Wow, it's so... healthy.
