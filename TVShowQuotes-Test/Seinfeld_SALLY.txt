Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot!
Don't worry, I brought your doll.. (Pulls out an extremely different doll - this one resembles a baker) Tada!
Is this for your comedy routine?
A whole case.
