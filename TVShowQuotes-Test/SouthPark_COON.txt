He's going to help me get rid of you guys so together we can make the world a better place!
My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening.  I don't know why, but we're seeing a huge trend in crime. We have to find out the source of this evil. Something big is about to happen, and it is up to Coon and Friends to stop it.  Yes, Toolshed.
As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself. 
Bab-ay,
I know you're askin' me to stay
Say "Please please please don't go away."
You say I'm givin' you the blues.
Mayb-ay,
you mean every word you say
Can't help but think-
Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!
I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!
It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny!
So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!
