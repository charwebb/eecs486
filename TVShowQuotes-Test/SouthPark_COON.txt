It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.
Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious.  But sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute.  Time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe.  Who's the sleepy little man?  My name is the Little Coon. What is your name?  Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  You're a sleepy man ne, Cthulhu?  Who's a needs a tummy rub? 
You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!
Cthulhu, you are a Coon Friend, and I'm the Coon! You will listen to me! 
The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.
No, not like milk! You see, I really think we're on different pages here, Mint-Berry Crunch! It's like you don't even- 
Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!
As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself.
