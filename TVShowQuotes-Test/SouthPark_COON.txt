Please sir, you must let us-

We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends!  Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!

Yeah, fuck all o'you!

As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself. 

Your evil-doing days are over, Mosquito! All of you shall now be dealt the swift hand of justice!

Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!

You've gotta be fucking kidding me!

Nuh uh, you guys are the bad guy. 

My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!

Suck it, bitches!

Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!
