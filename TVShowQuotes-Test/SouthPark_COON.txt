Now begins a new adventure for... MEEEE!

Sending all my stupid friends to oblivion!

Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!

Look guys, we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city.  Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden.

Let's work, people!  Uh, Mint-Berry Crunch, could I have a quick word with you in the debriefing chamber?  Okay, ummm, I really enjoy having you be a part of Coon and Friends and I certainly appreciate your on-time paying of dues and fees; it's just... I don't... I'm not getting your deal. I mean, exactly what is Mint-Berry Crunch supposed to mean?  I, I get that you're half man and half berry, and that you're... crunchy with some mint, but... to be a part of Coon and Friends, you have to have a clear and more... superhero kind of identity.  Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume.

We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!

Cthulhu, you are a Coon Friend, and I'm the Coon! You will listen to me! 

You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!

Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!

Come on, Coon Friends!

Oh, you motherfucker!  Cthulhu, this guy too!  Kewl. Oh get that fire-twirling hippie bitch.
