The evil girl villain fought with all her might, but the Coon was too much for her. As people looked on and cheered for the Coon, he clawed and punched the villain's stupid fat face!  This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans!
Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!
We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends!  Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!
There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!
Oh... I'm sorry Mom, can we go please?  Unbelievable! 
You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!
No you're right. For no reason. Clearly something is wrong with me. But you guys, what should I do?
My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!
