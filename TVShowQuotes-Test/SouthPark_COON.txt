It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny!
No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!
You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!
All right, now, we've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco, sent my friends into a dark oblivion, and so our next order of business will be Burning Man.  Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world, and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out. Pretty soon, the whole wold will be transformed thanks to the Coon!  Yes yes, the Coon and Friend. Now after Burning Man we'll take down Whole Foods alright?  The dark lord is agitated and the LeBron James technique might not work. The Coon will have to use an even more manipulative technique. Time to bust out: Cute Kitten.  Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.  Meow meow meow. 
There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!
Bab-ay,
I know you're askin' me to stay
Say "Please please please don't go away."
You say I'm givin' you the blues.
Mayb-ay,
you mean every word you say
Can't help but think-
I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!
Oh, you motherfucker!  Cthulhu, this guy too!  Kewl. Oh get that fire-twirling hippie bitch.
