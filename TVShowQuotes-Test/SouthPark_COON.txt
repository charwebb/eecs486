After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped.

Should I just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back? Tell then that I was being a selfish jerk?  What should I do?

Should I say I am not a role model? Should I not listen to my conscience? It's my conscience, Mom! What should I do? Go back to my room and pretend nothing happened? Not jump out the window and fly to New Orleans? What should I do, Ma? Tell me!

You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!

Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW!  Yes yes, I am the Coon.

What should I do? Should I admit I made mistakes? Should I say I've done this before? Should I write a song about how I should have stayed in my room? What should I do?

That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!

It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice.
