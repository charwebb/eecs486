You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'
Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.
