You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??

Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!  Oh Christ!  they might - could get me.

No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God.  Uh, just a dream.  OH MY GOD!!  GAAAH!! 

No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!

Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!

Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!
