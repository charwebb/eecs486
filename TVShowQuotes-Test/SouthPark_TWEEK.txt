Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??

Gaaa-hah!

Ah, what?!

Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! 

Oh God!

They're taking my underpants!

Rrrr!  Hr. 

I gotta move away, you guys!

I need coffee.

Harrr!

No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!

Aaaaaah!

No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!

Waagh!

Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!

Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy!

Aaaggghhh! 

Why?! What did I do?!

Yuh-ugh!

They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.

Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it!

Aaaahh!
