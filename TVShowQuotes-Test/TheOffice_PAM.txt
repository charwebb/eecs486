Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
[Mouths] Oh my god.
Just, we'll just keep going.
Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
[sighs] Um, Ok. Well?
Oh, really? Already?
What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy.
Oh!
And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.
No.
He's a purple belt. That's really high.
Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.
Oh. Doesn't matter.
Okay.
No.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
I just want to say goodbye ok?
We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
Yep.
They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.
No, copier's great.
I did!
It���s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam���s desk huh?
[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-
No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?
[whispers] Flooded.
Just checking in, how's it going?
Ok, so is that my spot?
[into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I���m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ���Hey, kool-aid.��� Yeah, your mama���s fat. This is Pam Halpert.
[Walks into conference room] Hey.
Yes.
Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing]
Well, let's hear it.
Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.
Oh.
We're getting married today.
I���m an oncologist and you are a dog.
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?
[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
Oh, thanks, Kelly.
Wait, you're going along with this now?
Yeah.
Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
Um, 2?
I know, right?
Oh! [laughter, murmuring]
Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.
No, Creed.
Really?
Uh totally.
We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they���re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ���Nice jugs���?
I can't find my glasses.
But you can't today, we're doing inventory.
Seriously?
Michael?
Chet ...something.
Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]
How's it going?
[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up?
Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
Fine.
[to Jim] Hey, stranger!
Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
Doesn't she sleep here?
That is amazing!
No, I���m not upset. I���m really excited for Darryl��� Maybe I���m a little disappointed that we���ll be losing him.
Okay. Go Ahead.
Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
Okay. [leaves room]
Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
I want the iPod.
Well, what does that... is that... okay.
Here we are outside-
Mm-hmm.
Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier.
Yeah, I do.
We're good to goooo!
Your watch?
Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry.  So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.
[goofy voice] Frank and beans!
Sure, do you have a camera here?
He does have a gift.
I'm on it.
I would like it off my desk.
Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?
That's awesome. Where are you staying?
I just knew.
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
How do you come back from that?
You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
Um, what?
I just have a quick question.
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?
No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.
Stop. Don't. Just...
Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
I'll get it right away.
We're friends. We'll always be friends.
And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
Yes.
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Hello, I'm looking for a room.
Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
Wow.
Nice job.
I know. I saw that.
Yeah...
It's nice to see you again, Dwight.
[giggling] Cut it out.
He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
[glances at it] Looks great.
Why do you doubt that she���s single?
I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
How about for dating my mom?
...noooo
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Come on! Ryan!
I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
[looks knowingly back] Just tell me.
Cool.
That's really nice Michael.
Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...
That's my dress.
Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
Uh...
Oh, great. Oh, I���m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don���t have it.
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
Is it, is it fake?
[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?
I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
[giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather.
Um, that spells incest.
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
You don't find Cathy attractive?
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
He said if it takes off he���s gonna buy us a new car.
Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
Hi! Hey, do I look ok?
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?
Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.
Wow.
Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
Oh--Oh my god!
Hey Phyllis, come here for a second.
Alright.
Yes I did.
[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
They do call me that.
I���ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here���s where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third ���chore wheel���, excited] We���ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it���s more fun this way.
Right.
I just helped someone out. It feels good.
You guys are stripes, I think...
[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
Of course.
There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.
[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]
Oh! [takes out earbuds]
Ok fine I���ll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws]
OK.
Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.
It���s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
Forget about my mural. It's stupid.
You messed up saying your name?
Oh.  Drew.  Sorry.
Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
Hmm.
[as the baby yawns]  Oh, big yawn.
It really was.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.
[Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.
Really?
Ugh...
Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
Jim?
Hey.
So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.
Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.
Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
Excellent, thanks.
Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
So this was all just a trick. You don���t really have any business to give?
Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.
Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
You doubt it?
It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
[stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
Umm, let me see.
Shut up, Dwight.
How ���bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
Giant check it is.
[to Michael] Where are you going?
[looking confused] You did that?
A piece of paper.
I don't have anybody.
Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
Oh!
No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
So he's not related to Michelle Obama?
Do you think it's a good idea?
[quietly laughing] It wasn't. I swear.
Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it]
Hey!
Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.
I don't think so, Andy.
We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
What's wrong?
Michael?
My name is Pam.
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
Michael, do something!
Tell me I'm good at sales.
No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second.
No.
Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
Huh.
Okay.
Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
What do you mean?
The signs will drive people inside.
How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can't you just be in art class with me?
Oh very.
Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
Do you drink this every day?
I'm going.
Thanks.
[Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.
No, no.
Oh! Uh, uh I'll go.
So rude, right?
Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
Oh, really?
And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
We're getting pretty good at it.
Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
Open the door up!
Can't your other cats keep her company.
Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
Thank you.
I like that one.
Do Not Resuscitate���[mild cheering]
Oh, no, that's, you don't have to.
Are you okay?
If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even?
I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.
Read through the pain. Be strong.
I did not know that.
How much did you give him?
What am I doing wrong, Brian?
No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
Yeah.
Ohh kay.
You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we���re in this together.
I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
Is that the police?
Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]
We are good to goooo!
[with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it���s choreographed!
[in Jim's ear] I wonder what else Dwight's been right about....
Michael!
I can do that.
And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
Bye. [quietly crying, sniffling]
Oh my God.
Yes, you should have.
I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
It's ok.
I can't believe that's not working.
No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
Yeah?
Are you okay?
No��� don���t. Just put it out of your mind.
Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim's house.
Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
When did you find time to do all this?
When-
Nice touch.
I should probably get back to work.
Yep, super lucky.
I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
The Beets Motel.
[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.
Hmm.
Yes.
Eh...
You think you're better?
Is he ok?
And Dwight would be like-
No, don't!
Nope.  No, no, that's better.  That wasn't even the worst of them.  I'm fine.
No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]
Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
Oh, yeah, um...
We could work from home.
Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh���no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ���New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.��� And then in parentheses, he wrote out ���as soon as possible.���
Okay, so, when you���re selling to this woman, just imagine that she���s that nice, reasonable barber.
Of course.
Kay.
That's here.
Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..
Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?
Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom...
You want to grab her?
You mean me?
[voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
It's really good to see you.
Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek]
So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
Oh my gosh.
How is it going?
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
the one pie that I don't.
I don't know. That usually works.
That's a communal bowl.
I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
Okay.
Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
Hey Oscar.  It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
Three. [Daryl nods]
No.
No.
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Phyllis!
[obviously flustered] Yeah.
Go ahead.
Meredith, I am so sorry about today.
I need to get out of this dress.
This is from all of us.
Not together!
Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
Carol Stills.
Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?
Sorry I almost got you killed.
So what is your gift?
Jim, what?
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.
It's okay. I'll see you at home.
What's wrong Michael?
I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
Hey, Michael, accounting needs your approval on-
[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
Who went?
Uhh...
I'll probably just wear this.
And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
Okay I give up. What are you?
That's cool.
Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
There. [phone rings]
Easily.
But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
Okay.
Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.
Dwight.
Yeah. It's really ugly
Corporate greed?
And the fear.
Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
Thanks, Michael.
Congratulations.
I don't think so.
Dwight, am I hot right now?
Here you go.
Michael, Angela's cat died.
Are you ready?
Have you talked to him?
Cute.
Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
Michael, you have to put your hands down.
You blew the sale, you idiot.
Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.
And it is so cute how she signs her name.
Michael, what's wrong?
Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.
Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
Because he just loves me too much.
Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
[with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
Michael, what's going on?
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
Okay.
I bought my veil.
Wow.
Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
What about the honeymoon?
We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
OK.
Oh, oh.
Hot fudge?
Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
Oh my God, he's really in pain.
It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head.
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
Kelly Kapoor, yes.
Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
You mean yesterday's paper.
Okay.
[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
You dream in cartoons? How fun!
I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here.
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
Michael?
No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
Shoot, she fell off.
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
Dwight, what are you doing?
Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?
Hey, what are you doing here?
Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.
[enters] Darryl! Andy!
Barf! Ugh, you suck!
That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell]
[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
Well, I wish you would.
No, no, that guy who hit on me.
No.
I know.
Is there a volume knob on that thing?
Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
Hey!
You got a fax.
I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
I am.
[finds Jim's picture] Ooooohhh no!
Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
This night was a disaster.
Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
Here's a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
Don't yell!
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
Dwight, get away!
Very official.
It's called being smart.
Hi.
We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.
The nerve.
Uh, just put him through to me.
Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.
[whispering] Who is it?
[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
Yeah.
These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
[mouthing to camera] Nana?
Miles Davis.
I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
Thanks.
���Scuse me?
He can be.
[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
You didn't have any.
Song parody writer.
Don���t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
[laughs]  Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?
Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.
I could get us a complaint.
Thank you.  You will not be sorry.
An alliance?
I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.
Hmm?
Well, I guess it doesn���t look that cool either. But, it���s been up there a long time, so it���s become a pretty big deal.
Okay.
So, cool right?
How did he use it again?
But of course!
What?
You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
