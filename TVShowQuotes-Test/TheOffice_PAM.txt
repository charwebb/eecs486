I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.
So what did you want to show me?
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It's Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible.  Anyway, I'm bored.  Come back!
Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.
You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
Andy's family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
I need to get out of this dress.
No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.
When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.
Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
What are you talking about? Yes we can.
It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.
I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.
Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
Tell him you'd like to go with him.
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
[into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I���m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ���Hey, kool-aid.��� Yeah, your mama���s fat. This is Pam Halpert.
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
Hide, they���re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don���t you go up and get one?
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
What are the odds that this is in any way real?
I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.
I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
They came up with that idea really fast.
[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
So, um... we'll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
Well, you��� you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
It didn't have anything to do with race.
So you have an office and a workspace?
Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]
I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we���re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ���Bye, Daddy.���
Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?
[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.
There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine
I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
I���m afraid that you���re gonna resent me and I���m afraid that���
Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
That's a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
[on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.
I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
Okay, so, when you���re selling to this woman, just imagine that she���s that nice, reasonable barber.
[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
[while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.
No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.
Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]
Has she been on the phone the whole time?
We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
Do you want us to count to three?
No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.
Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?
Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there���s something Jim isn't telling me.
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
Okay, let���s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.
What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
Is it a good message or a bad message?
Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
Because everything makes me cry, so what���s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
I almost lost it. That was too good.
Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.
I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
So how do you come up with your cartoons?
Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
When was the last time you went to the doctor?
We���re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I���m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn���t you be?
Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
Good. Good. And���[Nellie hits the car against the bushes]
Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?
Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.
Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.
What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.
Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.
[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
Oh, no, Kevin, it���s not a joke. Angela���s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.
Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]
Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.
We have an extra outfit in the bag.
[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we���ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
