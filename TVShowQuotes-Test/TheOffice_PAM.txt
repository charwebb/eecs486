Sorry.
[whispers] Like... like what?
No, come back! No, no, no!
Dwight, you have your hand up.
No.
Stuff gets around. I don't participate.
Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and...
Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
What moves?
Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?
Um... ���A���... ���X���? I don���t -- you got me.
Ugh.
Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes.
Last night? Let's see.
[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?
I like extra cheese, too.
Umm... it was not that long ago.
Oh! No, you should go.
Jim...
What?  Why not?
I'll just stand here?
No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
Not classy.
Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
Yes. Yeah.
What is that?
Oh, that's too bad.
It's good to be home.
Yeah.
See? That wasn't so hard.
You should get more sleep.
So I closed the door but the image of his...
I mean, you bought me a house!
These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.
Bye.
Yeah.
[sighs] Cece went down.
Sure, yeah. Yeah.
We are a family.
Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.
Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
Guess what poster he had on his wall?
Okay.
That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.
I'm confused...
Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck!
Hmm.
It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.
He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
Um, usually like that.
Okay.
He's nice and he seems interested.
In case I get sick.
White.
What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...
Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How���s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
Oh, boy. Um���
We were hoping you could do something like this���
Hey. I think it looks great.
You can do this.
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
OK.
Kevin, at most you���re saving a microscopic amount of time.
You���ve got this Schrute.
No, I mean, it feels...  pressure.
Wow.
OK, so then, when?
No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.
Wait, wait. What?
Oh, you're dead.
No.
Ok. Sure.
MmMm. You're getting colder.
No, they stopped making that show.
[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
Do you think that they're like-
Hey!
I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet.
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
What?
Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
And brush our teeth.
But, umm, thanks for the break.
Yes, because she's hot, right?
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
[looks out window] Michael! Michael!
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
Are you wearing anything under the robe?
I have to stay and retake it.
Relax?!
Definitely.
Really?
Good morning, can I help you?
For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
Bye. [quietly crying, sniffling]
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
Uh, Michael?
Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
What about Meredith?
Jim? No.
I would say no.
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
I can't hear anything!
Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
No.
And do my job?
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
So, can I..? [points to the door]
That sounds nice.
Did you find anything good in your desk?
Yeah.
I know. I know what to do.
Oh, thank you.
[closes laptop] It's deleted.
Sorry Andy.
Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]
Oh, which one is decaf?
[to Angela] Are you coming?
You sure?
Role call.
[mouths 'I'm sorry' to Oscar]
Really?
Well, I wish you would.
I think so. Okay.
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
No.  You were right.
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.
That's right, you did.
Hi, can I help you?
Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.
Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Great.
[on phone] hey!
Cool.
Unbelievable!
OK.
Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.
That's great!
I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ���Who���s that receptionist? I like her.��� Now I���m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you���re like, ���Oh, loser.���
Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.
Oh God! What?!
What? Really?
No one.
Really, Jim?  On Cupid's birthday?
Oh. Doesn't matter.
Yup.
You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
Where���s Angela? [Hands paper over her shoulder]
I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
What's wrong?
[on phone] So you know Stacy, right?
[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.
No it's not.
Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
Yes boss.
Leave!
Hey!
[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
Michael?
Hey, how are you?
...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
No, I'm not even wearing that much.
Thank you, Dwight.
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
He does have a gift.
[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
[shushes]
[on phone] So, there was no sales call.
Oh yeah.
Stop that!
[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I���m not laughing at you. I���m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.
I lied about some aspects of the building.
Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
Good, how are you? Busy?
What's that supposed to mean?
You are never going to be my father, you get out!
What?
Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
[to the cameraman] Did I miss anything?
Good luck, Michael.
Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
Yeah, he is.
I was after your money.
Oh, great. Oh, I���m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don���t have it.
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
Hey Creed.
Yes!
[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
[to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset.
How much?
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
Aww, my hero!
How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
[accent] It wasn't me.  I'm not goin' down for this!
Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.
You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Ok.
What do we do?
A little different. What time is it there?
I might be late.
Okay, stop watching me.
Love you.
I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
Thank you.
Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!
[weepy] Yeah, I hate those endings.
I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.
And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
Read the pros first.
Wait, wait.  My iPod's not in here!
Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
That fast?
I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
We thought.
Michael. Stop.
Yes.
So did everybody ...
Yep.
Hi, Kelly.
Hey guys, what's going on?
Do you want me to beat him up for you?
I can't see them when they're on the floor
Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
Thanks.
[to Michael] Where are you going?
OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view.
Yeah.  Sorry.
That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
Oh.
Her?
[on phone] Yes?
One of the tickets is for him.
Okay.
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
This is weird with you facing the other way.
Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs]
Nice morning, too.
[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet]
I don't know. That usually works.
Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
[enters] Darryl! Andy!
Yep.
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
Not until midnight.
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
There he is!
Did you end up investing?
Hey, uh, I have to work late.
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
Hey.
No yeah. Yeah.
What do you mean?
Of course.
I don't think so, babe.
It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
Um... Are you...
Have three stages, yeah.
[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
Nuh-uh.
Thanks.
Oh yeah?
Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.
Da-das.
No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs]
Aw! That's great Toby.
It tells me nothing.
The hospital.
Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
Hi everybody!
For both sides. Whoever paid more.
[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
You know Michael's been talking to her too.
Yeah. I feel better.
Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
What, no. That can't...I don't...
OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!
Great.
I think the tree looks nice.
I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
Bye! Hey.
[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch.
[Laughs] I have good cards.
We can move out.
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
Me too!
Hey.
I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
That one's great.
Wow. That was... wow.
Yeah.
Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
Look at this.
What are you gonna do?
No.
Love you.
[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
Hello?
Fail. I don't want to fail... again.
Thank you.
Michael, this is a bad idea.
You're okay.
You got a fax.
I am not pr-
How much?
My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]
Ok.
Okay, greatest strength.
No.
Doesn't Jan have money?
Okay.
Thank you.
How could we do what? [general murmur]
Oh, Michael.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
I have an important question for you.
Like what?
Cecelia.
Kay.
...we wanted to say thank you-
Hmm-mm.
Hmm.
Hey. Morning.
Mmm-hmm. [nods]
Oh, nothing that exciting.
Haha, yeah.  Say more nice things.
After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
You know what, I think we should get some other input.
Jan.
So, you're okay?
Don't, don't--
I used a variation of your move.
Michael!
I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
... What?
Jan's on the phone for you.
I'm not going to do that.
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
Yes.
It's kind of an impoverished country.
Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
Yep, that, yeah.
And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
You can have your snack in here.
No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
Well, let's play, what is it?
[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of 'Centerfold'] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
Thanks, Brian.
Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?
In his office. You can go right in.
Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
Really?
And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
Michael.  Michael ,it's okay.
But then I moved it.
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
You ready?
Yeah. And he worked here too.
[to Jim] Good luck.
Aww--
That's my dress.
Michael, why did you promise that?
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
Thanks.
Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
Dwight, I swear, we didn't do anything.
Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
Hey Charles.
Oh, right now?
No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Stop stalling! Come on.
Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
[laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation.
Okay, okay.
Ohh... poor Kevin.
[asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay?
Dwight, what are you---
Hey, do you have a second?
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
No, out! Get out now! Leave now.
Yeah.
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
I think that I should help him get home.
I don���t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
My mother.
You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
What do you think?
No.
Everyone, Let���s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just���I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
Hey!
If you wanna do something for the funeral...
Nope.
We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
Are you okay?
Ah. Ahh. [walks out]
Fine.
Like what?
And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]
Did you just mark on that?
That you remember her.
There's...
Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
Hi.
It didn't have anything to do with race.
No.
Darn it.
Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?
No thanks.
Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny 'Jim' game.
Probably.
Meredith, I am so sorry about today.
Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
Yeah.
I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...
Oh my God.
It���s getting tougher. I just didn���t know that it was gonna be this hard.
Andy that's way too personal of a question.
[door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
That's as specific as I'd like to be.
Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
I don't know.
[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
I love you so much. [starting to cry]
Don't call my mother your lover.
No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
OK.
[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
I definitely remember your dinner party.
We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
You're taking away our bathroom?
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don't worry, I'm being safe.  And I'm headed home.  I'm... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
Well, I kind of liked Legal...
And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
Well, thanks for being a good friend.
Yeah, but you have to calm...
Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]
Barf! Ugh, you suck!
I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
There's nothing new.
Oh my gosh.
Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
Big day.
What's up?
[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
So rude, right?
You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']
I'm sorry, he's not in right now.
And it is so cute how she signs her name.
Hi.
Personal shopper?
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Shut up, Dwight.
Who? The -
Yes.
Next on the list - open the mail.
Wait, when did we start calling it that-
Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Swaying isn't dancing.
Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
Yup.
What is going on?
I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
[with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it���s choreographed!
That's OK.
Oh my god! It's really you!
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
What a cute bench.
