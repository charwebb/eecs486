Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
[as others eat] Wait!
[looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know.
Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.
You don't have to do that, Kevin.
Umm... it was not that long ago.
Stop. [giggling]
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
Michael, you have to put your hands down.
You don't?
Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.
Michael?
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
It's just hard to explain.
As a human being.
Oh! So close to retirement.
Hey, there's a...
Lunch with a girl from my hall.
Michael! Michael!
Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
Dwight, what...
A celebrity sex tape.
I think he's just making her laugh.
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
Great.
Darn it.
Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
Thank you.
Oh! No, you should go.
Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
Thank you.
No.
There's no building... it doesn't exist.
Yeah, I know what a loft is.
I���m an oncologist and you are a dog.
What?
You said come in!
Yes.
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
Ohhhhhh!
Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
I know.
What are they doing?
No, I was um...
It's very important.
You won't be disappointed.
What?
Hot fudge?
I got it.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.
This is Mr. Scott.
[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
I really doubt it, Michael.
I don't know who he is.
For the bugs.
Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?
Really?
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
I won an art contest today.
You got a fax.
We're not dating.
It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.
Johnny Depp. [everyone looks confused toward Toby]
I'm not freaking out, Andy.
Yeah, maybe.
No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk]
Okay, see you later.
Forget about my mural. It's stupid.
Helene.
No.
[on computer screen] I can see you!
[smiles]
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
I love it.
In his office. You can go right in.
Kevin, you're such a gourmand.
Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]
But, no, but we are a family.
Well.. um I, I don't...
Shoot.
I can do that.
No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.
Yeah, I could tell.
...because that's what happens every time!
Oh.
Salesman.
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
So he's not related to Michelle Obama?
Okay, stop.
... We're dating.
Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]
Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
I can't see them when they're on the floor
My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
Well--
[on Bluetooth] That was weird.
Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
OK.
Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.
Yes.
Can you believe that...
What are you doing?
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
No no, you can go home. I'm good.
Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
Hello! This is... the client.
Nice job.
Go.
We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
No, I do.
I bet he went home.
Maybe $50,000.
The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
That is right. Don't make any more of it.
Of course you will.
[looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.
Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.
Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
It was the new one I did.
No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
Hey.
Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay.
Oh yeah.
Pan?
No.
What's going on?
[takes the phone] Hmm.
Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Yeah, great.
You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months?
Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.
Did... Karen get the job?
That is so insulting.
Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
What?
No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
Yeah, I can make you a list.
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
Uh hmm.
Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
We are a family.
Oh!...
Yeah... That was um...
Are you kidding me?
No.
No.  You were right.
[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
What do you mean?
I don't know. That usually works.
Oh my god! Ah!
No, you just have little dainty fingers.
Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
Yep.
Thank you.
Cool... This is your desk.
My God.
You called the meeting I don't..
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]
He's in a box?
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Tell them your opening line.
Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
The hospital.
That's what he said.
No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]
Yeah.
Nope.  No, no, that's better.  That wasn't even the worst of them.  I'm fine.
I'm cold.
[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who���s that?
It's really good to see you.
Don't you think you should say something?
Oh.
Hey.
Nothing.
[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They���re all deleted.
My mother.
I have 59 voicemails.
Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.
Dwight, what uh...
What?
Yes.
Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.
No, Michael, no.
Yes! [they embrace and kiss]
You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves]
Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
Come on.
So, can I..? [points to the door]
Are you sure you don't want to play?
It's called being smart.
I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
What card was she?
Hey.
What is it?
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.
Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
Why do you need more gas?
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.
Oh.
Think so.
Michael, it's freezing out.
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
I don't like that clip.
Mm-Hmm?
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
OK, yeah.
You did it.
Ok.
Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
She still has feelings for you.
Shh.
Smoked turkey.
Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
That's a sad story.
Yeah?
Everyone's waiting in the conference room.
I really hope you get the job.
Well I was taking the picture.
Yeah, some days I never go outside.
You headed out?
[enters with the kids] Family picture!
Hmm?
Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
I don't know.
Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
Oh yeah I bet.
[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.
Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]
Okay, that's it.
I don't know anything about that.
You're back in.
Ohh... poor Kevin.
Michael, I have Jan on the line.
Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, 'What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?' He said, 'If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.'
We have a meeting with an investor today.
Hi.  We did it.
OH, Holy God!
You shot a gun off -
We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
Read through the pain. Be strong.
Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!
You ready for your interview?
[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
Hey guys.
I���m so sorry.
Jim's bedroom.
How what?
Yes!
We are good to goooo!
You were scared?
[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
I would love to meet Long Tim.
Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
Oh really?
Me too!
Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
Oh.
Cool. Congratulations.
Try a different door.
One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Aww, my hero!
Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.
Thank you, Dwight.
Good.
Yes.
Listen, I know you really like Ryan--
And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Last week Jim wasn���t there, and they named the company Athlead.
I hate you.
Mmm.
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
Mmm-hmm.
Where's Alyssa?
Nothing.
No, I made brownies.
Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!
47, 48, 49! Jim wins!
I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
Yeah, I'm glad you said something.
Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay...
Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
Really?
[laughs] I like that song.
What?
Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
Hey, Michael.
That'd be great.
[laughs]
I know.
Um, just something somebody wrote.
Please? Just make sure he's OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]
Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.
I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
You sleep in the warehouse?
It was two.
Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]
I mean, you bought me a house!
[to Jim] Good luck.
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
What?! No! I-I got this. [Laughs] Okay?
This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. [interns are shown gathered around Kelly's desk, one holding a box of tissues, as Kelly cries and wipes tears] He didn't do anything sexual. [female intern opens a jar of salsa for Michael] He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. [Meredith rubs her breasts into Maurie's back] It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
Hey!
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
Oh.
Michael, please don't.
What? Really?
It was me.
Okay, we have to get home.
Yeah! Whoo! [Group cheers]
What do you need, Michael?
Ohhh.
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
Thanks.
[starting to cry] Right.
Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
Really, where?
Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
Hi, can I help you?
What do you mean?
No, Jim, stay!
Yeah, do you mind leaving?
[Laughs] I have good cards.
Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.
Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me.  We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
Hi.
Uh totally.
Are you inching away from me?
The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
You're gonna make another 'spreadsheet.'
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
Really?
It's still me.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
Jim.
Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs]
[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.
I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.
What is he doing?
This.
I'm going.
Oh, boy. Um���
Really.
Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
Uh, sure.
Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
No. Roy? No.
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
Hey Cathy.
I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Michael, that seems impossible.
Stop. Out with it.
Yeah.
[with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it���s choreographed!
I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?
Umm, let me see.
Sure. Meredith, do you mind?
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
Yep.
Okay.
[hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate.
Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
Yes boss.
Thanks.
We're good to goooo!
Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
Ten minutes.
I almost lost it. That was too good.
That's Michael.  You're out with Michael?
Okay.
Oh yeah, your mom would love that.
Of course.
Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
[not looking at Roy] Hi.
Okay.
She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
Yeah.
Don't.
Angela, I'm sorry.
Great.
No.
Called 'Impressions.'
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.
Ok, wait wait wait wait...
You can do this.
What's wrong with cupcakes?
Okay.  Aw, thank you.
Hey.
I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.
Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
Yeah.
Doesn't she sleep here?
Yeah.
If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
He does.
He can be.
Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh���no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ���New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.��� And then in parentheses, he wrote out ���as soon as possible.���
Oh, no. I just--
Yeah.
I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job.
Okay. [punches Toby's hand]
Oh.
Hey.
No, it's horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
You probably won't.
Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.
Cool.
Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
I hope so.
Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine
Jim...
Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
Oh, actually she can.
You want to grab her?
Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
I know.
Did you end up investing?
Cool.
Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
Yes.
I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
Yeah, I could read it.
I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, okay. It���s just that���s how Cece does it with the backwards ���E���s.
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
Mmm?
I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
Hmm?
[on phone] Michael, you're on with Jan.
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
No, thank you.
Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
[in New York] Right Dwight is loud.
At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
Come on, Michael! Yeah!
Are you ready?
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
[surveying an untidy office] The building���s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we���re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.
Thank you.
Because he just loves me too much.
I was helping Nellie drive���[Stanley interrupts]
What?
Okay. Angela?
Michael, why did you promise that?
[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
Hey Michael.
It costs seventy five dollars.
He sounds like a wounded animal.
No��� don���t. Just put it out of your mind.
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
It's nice.
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
[over phone] Hey baby, what's up?
Okay. How about skeet Schruteing?
Hey.
Really?  I don't know.
There's a KISS cover band in here.
Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
...kiss.
I'm good.
We could work from home.
Night.
One of the tickets is for him.
It wasn't so bad.
No, thank you.
Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?
Okay.
Exactly the way it is.
It's okay. I'll see you at home.
We could get Deangelo flowers.
