Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
Yes, I have been working with you forever.
[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.
Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
I feel like he���s always making these decisions for the family, and then I���m left playing catch-up.
[whispering] I���m so sorry. I hate this. You���re better.
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.
Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.
Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]
There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.
[laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.
He's not here. I don't know where he is.
[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I���m not laughing at you. I���m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.
That's as specific as I'd like to be.
Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
[sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second.
I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
[reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.
Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that's why he started casual Fridays.
Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?
He just had to wear his tux today.
Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.
Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .
Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
You are never going to be my father, you get out!
Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone���s ever been fired, Toby���s blocked it, so���
Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.
I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there���s something Jim isn't telling me.
Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you. [to Michael] It's Jan for you.
She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
Well, it doesn���t spin. We���ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and��� you see what chore you get that day.
Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.
Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...
I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
I think she looks good. Now that she���s wearing sports bras, we don���t see her boobs as much.
So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
[over phone] Yeah I'm fine.  Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go.
They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
Maybe because you hated her present so much.
No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.
He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.
You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
Do you want us to count to three?
I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...
A world where you truly can be anything you want.
Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]
And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Oh, no, Kevin, it���s not a joke. Angela���s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy.
Come on Angela, don't you have a game?
Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.
[sighs] It���s fine. It���s just a seating arrangement. Doesn���t matter.
Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go?
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] [serves] P.
You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
No! No, I���m interested. I mean I think everybody���s interested in why they have to sing it.
I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync.  You know, that's all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?
Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401.
Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]
[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.
I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] ���I���m not as think as you drunk I am!��� [crowd claps and cheers]
Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
Do you want me to ask where you're going?
[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.
Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
We have an extra outfit in the bag.
I'm a woman. I would want to know.
Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Tell him you'd like to go with him.
The shipping place closes in a half hour.
When are you ever responsible for your actions?
I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!
Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window]
Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?
[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.
[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
[on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.
Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
I can't see them when they're on the floor
[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.
Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Oh, thank God.  I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
Because she's conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.
How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...
So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
[Andy shakes his head 'no'] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
No, but that would've been a really good idea.
Yes, and there���s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
He said if it takes off he���s gonna buy us a new car.
I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
[referencing the ���tiny wheel���] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore]
I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
I am. You should come dance with us.
My husband would tell you to go for it.
We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they���re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ���Nice jugs���?
[whispering] I'm so sorry. [Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] ... seriously, we're just...
Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...
No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.
Everyone, Let���s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just���I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]
You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.
Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?
I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.
Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.]
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
Ha ha. That���d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get��� What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn���t I think of this? Andy���s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I���m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]
Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
[Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?
It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping.
I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. [Michael waves 'hi' at the phone]
I���m training a temp to be my replacement while I���m on maternity leave. Oh I should���ve mentioned I���m pregnant. You probably didn���t notice because it���s impossible to tell I���m so small. But yeah I���m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!
No, no. It's the principle of the thing.
