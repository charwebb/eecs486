Okay. Put everything back exactly how you found it.
[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I���m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn���t work here anymore.
Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go?
Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.
No, no, that guy who hit on me.
I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.
Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.
I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.
[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.
Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
You just still have these messages from yesterday.
No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.
Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.
Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.
Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals]
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
No, they had to come back for me.
Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.
Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. [at computer opens translator. Types in ���Elskere��� which comes back as ���lovers��� Pam smiles]
I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it.
No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.
In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?
I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'
I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job.
[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]
Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
Don���t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
[Jim rushes to open door for her] Thank you.
Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
Ok. [intense moment where Jim leaves and Pam seems conflicted.  She notices his umbrella and runs out to follow him]
You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom...
Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
I didn't see you! You should have yelled ���Crossing!���
Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny 'Jim' game.
Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.
Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.
You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
[sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
We���re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I���m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn���t you be?
Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.
Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.
[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?
Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me.  We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
Hey Oscar.  It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone���s ever been fired, Toby���s blocked it, so���
The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
Shut up, Hide! ��I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I���m okay with that.
He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
Tell him you'd like to go with him.
One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.
Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.
Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.
I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
[on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
[asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay?
Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
That's as specific as I'd like to be.
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.
Oh, okay. It���s just that���s how Cece does it with the backwards ���E���s.
There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.
Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let's get you into a tub.
[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?
Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]
Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.
Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice.
And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
Every night, Jim and I watch an episode of The West Wing together on DVD.  Um, he wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica and I wanted to watch Cranford... so we compromised.  Next we're gonna watch Cranford.
Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
Oh, and then this was Phyllis���s idea���[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!
And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]
No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...
What? You have something you want to say?
You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don't worry, I'm being safe.  And I'm headed home.  I'm... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.
And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?
I think you need to go to Florida.
I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
Really, you can���t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he���s basically Gumby with hair. [Darryl laughs]
So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I���m not laughing at you. I���m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.
Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
Hmm. I think Jim���s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping.
It���s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
[laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
Ok fine I���ll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws]
We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
[in Jim's ear] I wonder what else Dwight's been right about....
Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]
[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
I just helped someone out. It feels good.
I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
[shocked after seeing the torn up carpet] Hey��� What happened here?
Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
Oh, no, Kevin, it���s not a joke. Angela���s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
But sometimes he talks about flesh��� and bacchanals.
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
Okay, when you���re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!
Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?
You are never going to be my father, you get out!
Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.
You know Michael's been talking to her too.
Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.
Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?
Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?
There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, 'What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?' He said, 'If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.'
Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
You know, Jim���s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.
Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.
[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.
[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who���s that?
Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.
I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box]
