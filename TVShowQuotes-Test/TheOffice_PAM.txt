Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
[in Jim's ear] I wonder what else Dwight's been right about....
Please? Just make sure he's OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]
I'll just get a ride home from Angela.
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.
[through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
Why is there a circle with a line through it?
Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?
[Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.
There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs]
Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly.
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?
Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
So what did you want to show me?
No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word 'perfect' in here!
I���m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She���s obviously super cute I get it. But I���d like to point out there���s 50 pounds more of me to love if that���s your thing.
Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
[loading up car with Michael] Don't look up. Don't look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window]
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.
But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.
Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.
No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie]
I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
[laughs] I don't know. I think Michael has a date.
You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.
[on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.
Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...
Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
[hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate.
And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]
[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]
Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?
Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.]
That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.
Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
This is not enough for you and I���m afraid that I���m not enough for you.
Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.
I'm a woman. I would want to know.
I lied about some aspects of the building.
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here.
I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]
Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.
We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.
Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?
I love you so much. [starting to cry]
And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
Yeah. I mean, listen if we���re gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
[knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.
No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. [Michael waves 'hi' at the phone]
Guess what poster he had on his wall?
Hey, Cece, Daddy���s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.
No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.
I don't think those were yours to take.
[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]
Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.
I don't want to have my baby here.
Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It's time for cake.
The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]
You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]
Then who do you think will get the job?
[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
No! No, I���m interested. I mean I think everybody���s interested in why they have to sing it.
For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]
Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.
One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...
You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.
Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]
Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.'
Tell me one thing about you I don't know.
I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?
[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park?
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.
Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
You know what? I-- I-- I don���t think you want to start a conversation with me about what���s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?
You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'
We don't normally download films illegally.  Because we're honest,  hardworking people.
Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.
Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She's got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]
You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
No no, you can go home. I'm good.
Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
Is there a volume knob on that thing?
[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who���s that?
Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
But sometimes he talks about flesh��� and bacchanals.
Oh, no, Kevin, it���s not a joke. Angela���s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
[Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.
What's going on, why do you have a second job?
Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.
Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
That's as specific as I'd like to be.
Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.
No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
Jim. Can I see you for a second?
There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, 'What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?' He said, 'If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.'
Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.
You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
Some of us like the walk more than others.
Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
Hmm. I think Jim���s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes.
I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it.
[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...
Find someone else, I don���t know. Ask Phyllis.
Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim]
New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?
If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.
No, they had to come back for me.
That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?
The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
[studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It���s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I���m gonna limit myself to one shrub.
But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
We���re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I���m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn���t you be?
