Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
[referencing the ���tiny wheel���] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore]
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]
I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk.
Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
For what it's worth, I liked your party better.
Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
I mean, we���ve having issues. It can���t hurt to talk about them, right?
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
Well, we won���t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you're going out with Jim.  I'm not going out with Jim.  You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!
Meredith...  [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44.  It's not ready Kevin!
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
[Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.
Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?
[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?
For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.
[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.
Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.
I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync.  You know, that's all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That's my job.
You know, Jim���s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
You might want to trim it a little.
[smiles] Go ahead.  I think it's your turn.
You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.
No, no, that guy who hit on me.
Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]
You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.
You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...
So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.
I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.
I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
It���s getting tougher. I just didn���t know that it was gonna be this hard.
[with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.
Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
You know what? I-- I-- I don���t think you want to start a conversation with me about what���s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?
Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
I'm a woman. I would want to know.
Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.
Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.
I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] ���I���m not as think as you drunk I am!��� [crowd claps and cheers]
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.
He just had to wear his tux today.
It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
Okay, you do not have to do this.
If you���re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea ��that you can���t please everybody all the time.
[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.
You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months?
No, they had to come back for me.
Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
Shut up, Hide! ��I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I���m okay with that.
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
Why is there a circle with a line through it?
[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.
I don���t think you guys understand why we���re doing this. It���s-
Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.
I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.
[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.
Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.
Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
[holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought.
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
I thought we were having a nice time.
I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
So, what do you say we get started?
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.
You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
[hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
49 again? That's nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]
Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.
[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
I���m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it���s like a double date.
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?
We need everything back the way it was.
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
So���what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
It's like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]
I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.
So you have an office and a workspace?
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
