This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
Oh, my God.  I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]
Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.
Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell]
Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.
[laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
So, umm, is this your first office job then?
Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.
I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...
I could work here. I could see this.
Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
[sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?
Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh���no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ���New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.��� And then in parentheses, he wrote out ���as soon as possible.���
Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!
No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?
Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]
[Andy shakes his head 'no'] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...
[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...
We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]
People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.
I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.
Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!
Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.
Oh! Yes! [Group cheers, Dwight moves to driver seat]
Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..
You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
[to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.
I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
Because we're usually not on the same page.
I don't think we really need that, Michael.
Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.
Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes.
She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.
You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
[to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]
You did good, Dwight. It���s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan���s not normal. Let���s just go. She���s not going to sell to us.
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
[looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change.
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday...
Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?
Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
My husband would tell you to go for it.
Okay, let���s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don���t think anything���s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there���s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.
It���s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.
We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?
I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim]
No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie]
Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator]
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?
Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
Jim. Can I see you for a second?
Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.
And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
[over phone] Yeah I'm fine.  Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go.
[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.]
[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
[whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
I'll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.
I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
I'll just get a ride home from Angela.
Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels...
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
Well, it doesn���t spin. We���ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and��� you see what chore you get that day.
Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.
You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God!
The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.
[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet]
[changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure.
Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
[voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! It���s so great to see you.
Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
[giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather.
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up?
Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?
So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.
Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.
[sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this.
Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.
I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word 'perfect' in here!
We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.
No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I���m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let���s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?
I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.
We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
Ok.  There's a transcript between a naval ship-
Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.
No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.'
[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.
Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
What are you going to do with your time off?
Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...
So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.
So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything���s in order.
Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
I lied about some aspects of the building.
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.
So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way.  You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em?
Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.
Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.
The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious.
Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.
Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
