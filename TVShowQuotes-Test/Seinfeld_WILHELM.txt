Uh-a Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is bashed in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of a terrible car accident, and trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.
George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets.
(proudly, to the man seated beside him) He's my protg.
Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.
