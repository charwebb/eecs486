Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.
Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
Butters is our son. He's not for sale.
I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family.
It's still here, ih... it's all still here.
...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?
It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.
Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.
Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What what did he do?
That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!
I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.
Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it.
Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.
Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.
Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!
Thank you so much for taking him in.
Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks.
We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.
Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you.
That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?
Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!
