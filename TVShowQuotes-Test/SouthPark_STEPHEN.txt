Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.

What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?

You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked.  The battery was half empty.

You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.

Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry.  Hold on, sorry, went too far.  This is your opportunity to make Handicar thee transportation of thte future. Think what you could do with all that money. 

You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay.

Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski.

Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again.  There he is. There's my boy! Come on, Butters!  Oh... Butters... you smell like... bacon  Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back!

So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels.

Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!

Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!

There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?! 

No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over.

We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said "No more!" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away. 

He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.

Oh, well, too bad.  Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her.

Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!

AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!

I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!

No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.

Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us.
