Oh my God! These people don't even know!  Hurry! You gotta go!
Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. 
No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him.
What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!
I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
Just let me sign.  All right, he's coming to you.
Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive.  We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King. 
It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. 
So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels.
...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?
He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.
Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  One! Two!  Uhh, Bu-Butters?
Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!
Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.
Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.
Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!
Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money?
You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY! 
Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it.
Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady.
