Oh, well, too bad.  Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her.
Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. 
Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.
That's right!  If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!
I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect.  What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet. 
...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?
So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!
Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here.
Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son. 
Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?
Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!
I'll never give up!  I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!
Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore.
The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.
No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?
Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.
Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib.
Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.
Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine.
No. All the phone lines are completely down. 
Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!
