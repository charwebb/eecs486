Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad. 

Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!

Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way.

Jesus.

Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!

Indian... Burial Ground?

No. I've I've got to tell him!  Butter? Butters! 

Oh yes, thank you for coming.

Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?

Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!

Butters?! Who is that?!

What happened?

You're a grounded old bear.

What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!

...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?

You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!

Butters is our son. He's not for sale.

Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?

Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton.

You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!

You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!

Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?

Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!

What's he done now?!

What is it, dear?

OH YOU'RE GONNA GET IT MISTER! Just Wait until I get home!

Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now!

I know that! What do you-?

Let me go too.

He's stopping at another house. 

No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.

Don't talk back to me! 

Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!

If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby.

You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters.
