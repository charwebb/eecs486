You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. 
Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!
I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!
Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!
AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!
Inside.  I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news.  Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?
Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life.
You're back. You're back-he's back!  I love you son!
You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked.  The battery was half empty.
Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.
We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.
Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?
Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!
Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! 
Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!
No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.
I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?
Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.
You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY!
