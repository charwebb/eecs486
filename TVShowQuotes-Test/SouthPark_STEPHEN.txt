You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY! 

I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!

Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!

Please do not adjust your televisions!

He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.

It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.

Hehey! 

No. All the phone lines are completely down. 

No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision. 

Butters, right now!

Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad. 

It could come back.

Let me go too.

It's called "working" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!

Butters!

Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault.

Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it...  flies by itself.

That's great, Randy!

What's the red sticker?

Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!

There you are, Butters!

Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you.

My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.  All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page,  it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did?  We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!

You see?

What keeps a family together, Butters?!

Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars.  It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front.

What the hell is this?!

Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry.  Hold on, sorry, went too far.  This is your opportunity to make Handicar thee transportation of thte future. Think what you could do with all that money. 

A penis?

And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done!  Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to "Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?"! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!

It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.

But we are very very proud nonetheless.

He's... paying for everyone's debts. 

Excuse me?!

Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady.
