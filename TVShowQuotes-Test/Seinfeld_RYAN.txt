I'd rather not say.
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
What nerves?
I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
Will do.
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
That's a little derivative.
Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Did she say something?
Yeah... Mmmmm...
Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
Yep.
Hey.
You staying?
Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
This is not funny, man, let me down.
Yo, Ry from WUPHF!'
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
Maybe.
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
Okay well, that's a relief!
Thank you.
I���m not wearing the right shoes for this.
I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
No.  You don't know until you live there.  There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
Okay...
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
Uncle Dave?
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
Uh yeah, we'll meet you there.
What?
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?
No you don't.
Oh gross.
What's, uh, going on here?
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.
I don't wanna go back in.
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
I can field this one.
Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
You read my mind.
Oh...
Hey. You're looking for me?
Fine, don't worry about that.
No.
Yeah, I figured.
Cool, thank you.
It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Fozzie bear?
I don't have a tape player. So...
I don't know what you're talking about.
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Actually, it was.
And?
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
You drive.
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
Can I see it?
I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Yeah I make originals too.
Scranton suits you.
Ahh, I don't think so, no...
Yeah.
No.  It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
Prison sounds great.
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office]
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
[whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
What? [they hug]
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
No.
Well... you look great.
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
Wear something nice.
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me.  Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
I--- I would find a way.
Jim.  I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history.  I've even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.
You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
How's It Going?
Let's get a drink.
Oh!
You wanted to have sex in my office.
What's up Facebook?
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]
It's from '99.
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
We���re gonna be together forever.
Congratulations!
Yeah.
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
Why not? What are you doing?
No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
Got that. [Metallic thud] Get down.
What?
[shakes his head]
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
Never gets old.
No. You can't imagine it, though.  The energy when you're actually there.  You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you.  Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
You should've put him in custardy.
