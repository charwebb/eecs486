Oh no! 

No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?

Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.

Huh?

Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!

Woohoo! OOWW!

Oh, pap√°. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?

Dude, this is gay!

What? 

Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  Car one to base--  Aghh! 

I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
