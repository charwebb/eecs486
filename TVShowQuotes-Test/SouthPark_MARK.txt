But... they're... children!

I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!

Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? 

Only the most important person in the world.

Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!

No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?

Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  Car one to base--  Aghh! 

Get off me! 

Papa?

Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  Ow.  Ow. 

Wow, what a great house!
