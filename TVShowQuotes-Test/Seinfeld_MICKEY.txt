Why don't you just cut the stupid pants and get them off already/
You (grabs Kramer)
I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight.
Rock.
You sure did. Big time.
(quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy?
Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done.
That was quick! Nice job, Santa!
Not Donna, it's Donner.
You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?
Right, the rage. Tons of rage.
