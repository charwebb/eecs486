Kramer
(To Beth) How many is that for you?
Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done.
Hey Bob. What's with you? You gotta problem? (to Kramer) You see that look he gave me? (starts to get up to go after him)
There is no break.
You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?
Look, you take that commie crap out into the street.
We'll look like idiots. (They exit)
Kramer's going to be my scene partner.
Oh Hi Kramer. What do you want, I'm a little busy.
