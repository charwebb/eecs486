This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!

These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!

Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!

...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.

Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.

That isn't all, Mayor!  The school play is doing a Nativity scene!  It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!

Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!

No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.

Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name. 

Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.

But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.

I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.

When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.

I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.

That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.

You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. 

It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.

Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.

Now, where did you leave him, young man?

It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.

You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.

Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! 

Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!

Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.

I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.

He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. 

That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.

Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.
