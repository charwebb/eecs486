This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! 
But who can we get to build it?
So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?
We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.
He left a note saying he's never coming back.
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!
That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.
He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.
Hey, you will not get away with this!  That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.
Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.
Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.  Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.
You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.
We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.
This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!
Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.
Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!
Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.
Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. 
Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. 
I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.
Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?
