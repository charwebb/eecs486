My baby! Oh, God, the horror! 

Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!

All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. 

Oooh.

Oh, this is terrible! 

Ike!

It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.

When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.

I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...

How dare you include the Nativity in a school play?  Don't you realize my son is Jewish?! 

our people always win.

I thought it would be good for you.

He's your age and about your height.

Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!

Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.

Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!

Your father's right, Kyle.

You'll know

Hoh, dear God!

Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?

Sharon, isn't that your father?

Sure. You bet.

All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.

Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!

No, why?

Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.

Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. 

to make the dreidel spin

I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.

Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!

Hello?

To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."

I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.

I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.

That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.

You'll know

Oh, thank you Eric.

I'm sure they are.

Kyle, what happened to you??

Kyle, this instant! One, two. 

Oh, that was wonderful!

Go get the door, Kyle!

What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!

We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!

So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?

So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?

Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!

Where did you hear that?

O-o-ogh! 

Ike! 

Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you  Kyle, and you can be Kyle...  Two! 

The new Canadian Prime Minister?

Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--

Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty!  Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! 

We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.

You'll know
