New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it 
So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?
Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?
Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. 
Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?  Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!
Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.
Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.
Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name. 
Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?
...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.
Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.
No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.
Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.
They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?
That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?
Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!
Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.
I'll put it in the microwave right away. 
Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!
That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
Their grandmother's been dead for three years.  You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your-  mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!
No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. 
I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.
Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.
Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.
