The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!
There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?
Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!
Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. 
Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.
But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.
Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
I want to talk to you all about your school nurse. 
These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!
I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.
Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!
She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.
He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted. 
So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!  Ike, love?
Hey, you will not get away with this!  That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.
Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. 
The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?  Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!  We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes. 
Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.
Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?
Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?
Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.
Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. 
Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.
