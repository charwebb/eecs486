I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.

Try again, bubbe!

Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 

It won't happen again. 

How is my little jellybean?

There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?

Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!

Yeah, the nerve of some people.

Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!

Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.  You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins. 

No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.

Absolutely not, Kyle!

Kyle!

Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. 

Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.

I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.

Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.

...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.

I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.

O-o-ogh! 

Oh, I didn't realize.

Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you?

Kyle, open the door.

Hello?

He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.

No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.

I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.

...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.

Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas. 

A dolphin?!?!

We'll talk about this later, Gerald!

But look what they put on. 

Kyle! What happened to you?!

Oh my God! 

That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!

Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.

I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--

Kyle, don't say such things!

Kyle, what happened to you??

We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.

But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.

Us Jews don't believe in hell.

Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!

Whatwhatwhaaat?!

I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.

Oh really? Is that so?

What are you gonna do?

Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.

O-o-o-o-oh!

Oh, there he is.  Over here, Kyle! 

Ahhh.

Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.

Wonderful!

Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!

Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!

Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.
