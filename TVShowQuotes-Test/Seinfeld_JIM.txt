Fair enough.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
I'm so sorry, I forgot.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
Yeah, me neither.
Right.
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
I can imagine.
Hey.
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
You've seen it, right?
Too loud.
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Andy? You all set?
Pam, I'm scared.  I'm real scared.
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
I thought we had that looked at.
Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Paul Anka.
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
I'm good. How you doing?
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
You all right?
Mm-hmm.
No one's moving!
So happy right now.
What the hell's a rundown?
How many buttons do you have?
Members of the office, hear ye.
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
To what?
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
My home office, this is it.
I'm not talking to you.
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
...Okay.
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
Yeah.
Hmm, sounds risky.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam]
Because you���re sitting?
What?
Why don���t you start?
Classic.
What is that chestnut?
Why'd you do that?
So now you're writing two things?
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
Oh! There it is!
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
Why not?
Really?
Ok.
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
No I'm not.
Amazing. How do I look?
That's really not cool.
John Dillinger.
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
[laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]
Nice job, man.
Forward, definitely.
Okay.
Yeah. You're right.
Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
Scuse me?
Close.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
You are not going to believe this.
That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
I don't want to go.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
Michael, watch the road!
Hm hm.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.
It wasn't me.
Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight]
Oh, it's like naughty or nice.
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
Solitaire?
Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
Alright buddy.
OK...
Damn it.
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
Ah, they moved the shower.
Where we going?
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
Is that Mose?
Well, by worst, you mean the best.
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight]
Anything would help.
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Um... I don't think so.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
[as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
Best Christmas ever.
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
Hey, Kev.
Why not?
You alright, Santa?
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
Yeah. [chuckles]
I was very drunk.
[to Pam] A banana?
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Smasher!
Thanks.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Ok, sure. Will do.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
Hum.
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Tell me about the cologne. How much?
Mmm hmm.
You really want to do this?
Okay.
I bet.
Yeah. I'm definitely going.
Hey.
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
No.
Ok.
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Let me call you right back. Okay.
We���ll talk tomorrow?
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
Hey, Jan.
I'm on it.
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
Ransom.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Absolutely.
What are you doing?
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
Look at that one though, he's smiling!
What was you? You were the leak?
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
Okay, what?
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Kev, c'mon.
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
Hey!  Welcome back!
Really?
I know.
She looks older.
Uh, Larissa Halpert.
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
[Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.
Who?
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
You knew it.
Michael...
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
Oh my God.
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
We can talk about that later.
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
No. Looks good.
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
For the North.
Why, what happened?
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
What answers?
OK.
Hey.
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
I'm driving?
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
Yes.
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Okay, just talk.
Yeah?
We didn't have one scheduled.
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
All right, good stuff.
Let's go.
Peepa.
[walks up to reception] Margaret?
Yep.
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
Oh.
On what?
I'll take it.
Hey.
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
For me, it was.
Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Yes.
You're not having sex.
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
You are not my superior.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
What?
Oh yeah.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
So instead, you screwed me?
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Oh yeah? What's the first best?
Well, I second that emotion.
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
Alright, let me turn on some music.
Yes.
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Yup.
A semester?
Pam?
Yes.
[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.
I'm Jim, by the way.
Right.
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
What���s up?
Oh my God! You are so drunk!
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
Frisbee-based competitions...
I thought you liked the store?
You sure?
No. I would've said no.
And doctors.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
Jimbo!
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
[sighs]
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
Nope, not at all.
Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
Striker!
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
What's that cooler?
Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.
No.
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
I absolutely don't understand, either.
No thanks.
She does not like him.
Okay.
Yeah.
Back door.
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Uh--
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
You ok?
That's right.
Oh, you don't know her.
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
I... will... [gives up and walks away]
This is gonna be awful.
That's Toys R Us, I think.
Why?
Hey, and if you���re ever in Austin...
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
Oh, God.
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Not bad right. [swinging golf club]
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
Okay, you could just show up late though.
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Okay.
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
Sure.
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Fine.
No.
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
You define foment.
What's that?
Yup.
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
I don't think you understand -
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
Dwight!
Too much now.
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
What was?
Nope. Different movie.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
Couple of times.
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
Was that not the--
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]
Michael.
[to camera] Didn't see that one coming.
You need to stop talking.
Nope.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Well, the joke was on you.
[laughs] Told you.
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Oh.
You could just be saying it to get the job.
Left.
Nope.
He's fine. He's indestructible.
What happened to you?
Really?
No big deal.
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
Good one.
Yes.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
Hey! Back here.
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
No.
A wooden duck?
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
Really? Does he do good work or--
Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.
Ready?  One, two, three...
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
Yeah. Good to be back.
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
Perfect.
You know what's crazy?
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Hey.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
What are you doing?
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
All right.
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
Nope, just going to see Pam.
Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep.
No, they don't.
Hey Kelly. What's up?
Truce?
Cathy wants to leave our clump?
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
Yeah, he's definitely something.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
Gettin��� psyched up?
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
Have I not proposed to you, yet?
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
Okay.
I'm just doing my job, man.
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
985,000,000,000,017.00
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
In the fridge.
Of course.  What is like a hostage?
Thanks.
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
Michael! Michael, pull over!
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
We'll look into it.
Uh...
Right.
No, no, dude, no.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Michael.
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
Your department's just you, right?
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
What would Bob do?
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
Tom Cruise!
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Okay.
Ok...
Respectable?
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
All right.
That's what she said.
Hey, Ryan?
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
All right, I'm gonna go now.
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
See you later.
Really? Why?
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Nobody.
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
And then we checked the fax machine.
[shaking head at the camera]
I'm trying everything.
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
What was that?
Sounds great.
That's harsh.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
You're creeping me out.  I'm gonna go.
I think they're going to the conference finals.
We've been through this.
And then you'll be saved.
Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
No.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
Okay, good. Stay right here.
What?
Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Hm. Really tough call.
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
What?
Yeah?
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
Michael, it's really not a competition.
I don't know. I don't know.
Okay.
Nope. It's over.
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
The office.
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
Oh I'm sorry.  What?
Yeah, it does, actually.
I'm gonna introduce myself.
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Beesly! Oh, my god.
That's not true.
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
[raises hand] Are you stoned?
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
Who are you talking to, specifically?
Oh, so that's it?
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
Uh-huh.
I missed you.
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Uh-huh.
Love you.
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Spot on.
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
Justin Timberlake?
Do you need us for any of this?
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
That did. Pretty huge laugh.
117 Mount Bergin St.
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
Michael, that is hilarious.
Oh.
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Bye.
[exhales sharply]
Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
Okay.
Ok, where is he?
Gimme a break.
Actually not.  It was really so-so.
[whispers] That's a good point.
Woah, you guys going to lunch?
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
What have we got here?
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
No.
I'm not gonna eat it.
Oh, good.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
Alright.
Okay. See you guys.
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
Hmm���Heda. [alert] No.
[smelling the stink] Oh.  Wow.
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
Hi.
And how many would you like?
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
Oh boy...
Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
I don't care.
Thanks, yeah.
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst.
I'm couching it!
This is my desk.
Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
An urban thing...
I am working on it.
Yup.
So good.
Come on Dwight! Use words.
Cheer up. We made a sale.
And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan]
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
[Dwight and Andy stacking boxes rapidly] Nice.
Oh, this looks promising.
Alright, love you.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
What are you doing?
Really...
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
Not at all, can we go?
So what's in the box?
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
Wow. Busy morning.
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
It is really special.
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
Here they come.
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
Pam? Get us back into it.
Of course.
Oh my God!
I am.
What?
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Great. See ya' then.
I know.
All right, well it already went through, so...
Yeah, okay.
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
No.
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
Okay.
All right.
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
I think I'm gonna go.
Yep.
Absolutely.
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
I���m very sorry.
What?
Yeah. That does not feel good.
Thank you very much. It was fun.
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
This was my decision, not yours.
Is that what happened to you?
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
But you didn't fail.
Okay, I���ll call you right back.
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
You... owe me.
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
Yes.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
Wow.
Pretty good.
That'd be great.
Think you can let go?
And impressions!
Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...
I know. We're pretty excited, too.
Just like that.
Okay.
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
[over phone] And Dwight.
