Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
We have to try this out on somebody.
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
What do you do in your free time?
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
Well that is a very safe place for them.
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
