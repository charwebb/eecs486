Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
[imitating E.T.] Holly misses old phone.
Lemonade sounds great.
Well you don't have to agree.
Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.'
Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.
Oh, that would be great. You need that.
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
Mmm hmm.
I'm going out with you.
Oh no no no. I'll be fine.
Yeah.
Dieting's only half of it.
[laughs] I can't wait.
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
That-That's my car.
Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
You romanticize things.
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.
[enters conference room] Hello.
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
[to camera] No, he didn't.
Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
Oh.
Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?
Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
They're warm.
No, this is Michael Scott.
Look I need to talk to you.
Hey! Good movie.
Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
[talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper.
No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.
Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
No, we're gonna do the long-distance thing.
What's wrong?
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
...Hell yeah.
Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs]
Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]
They didn't know?
A chastity belt.
Oh, good.
It was just for a few weeks!
And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
[Brooklyn accent] You ahh.
Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
Okay. Good night.
How do you know when its time?
This is your moms old stuff?
Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.
It's the gas station on Benet Street?
Oh, no.
