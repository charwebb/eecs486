Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
Hi.
I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
[on phone] Hello there!
That-That's my car.
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.
No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
Oh, it's just later.
You romanticize things.
Dunder Mifflin.
Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right?
Mmhmm.
...Hell yeah.
Thank you, you too.
Hey.
That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
All right.
Yes.
I love the view.
Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
You must be Todd.
No.
Nope.
[on phone] This is Holly.
Okay, one more quick one.
It's a pea shoot...
Hi.
What are you doing?
I don't think he's funnier than me.
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
Math is hard.
You made ourselves to be more than we were.
I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
Michael I think this is our fault.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
Good.
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
You do?
Almost, Kevin.
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
Are their egg rolls really that big?
No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
What'd you think?
Oh no no no. I'll be fine.
No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.
Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off...
Oh, the mall could be fun.
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
