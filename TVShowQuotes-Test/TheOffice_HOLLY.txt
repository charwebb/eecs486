Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]
Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
He knows how to get things. He got me.
