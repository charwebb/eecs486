No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
You never told me you made a movie.
Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
