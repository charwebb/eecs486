Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.
Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.
Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.
Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off...
