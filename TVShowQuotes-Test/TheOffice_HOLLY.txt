For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It's gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it's not.  I have to read from the binder.
We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, 'oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.' Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
No! You do not talk to him like that!
Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
He knows how to get things. He got me.
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.
I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
Oh, that would be great. You need that.
Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
