Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?

...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you. 

Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!

All right, what's next.

But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?

Oh, come on, buck up, little fella.

Oh, how sweet.

Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there.

Oh, don't they look adorable?

Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?! 

Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!

Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.

She's a cannon! 

My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?

Something you sit on.

This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?

So when does it run out?!

Okay. Hands on your buzzers.

Where is she?

How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?

Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!

O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.

You do?

Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.  Wait a minute... It's the snake!
