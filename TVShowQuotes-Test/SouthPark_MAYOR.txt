What?

Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like...

Yes. We're trapped!

I just had a brown baby boy. 

They're starting to understand, Johnson.

Yes, you know, expire, end.  Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?

What?

Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. 

Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country.

But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.

This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year.

My God!

This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.  Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag! 

Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!

You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. 

Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.

Now what do we do?

What's two plus two, Jakov?

Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. 

Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!

Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.

What does this mean to the town?

Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!

He is.
