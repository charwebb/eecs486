Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!
Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell.
Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue? 
We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, butâ€¦ 
All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school.  Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral.
Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.
Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?
Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!
And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! 
Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals;  where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.  But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!  And now, let's kick off our weeklong festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!  Let's hear it for these brave souls!  What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators! 
Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs!  Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France!  And, all one of you lucky constetants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?
Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!
Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!
