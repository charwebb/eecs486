[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
Just let me loosen my dress.
We all checked in?
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
Please, please.  Don't hurt him, okay?
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
Cosmopolitan, please.
[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
Michael, it has nothing-
Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
Is anybody else in the...
What's the bottom line?
I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
What's wrong with you?
What does that mean?
Well...
Good, good.
Don���t patronize me.
Michael, please.
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
Did you take care of the situation?
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
You son of a bitch!
Michael.
Ok.
Yeah!
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
Alright.
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Ah.  Thanks, Dwight.
When did the check come?
Great! Uh-huh?
Do we understand each other.
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
I'm not going to do that Michael.
I'm doing it right now. To you.
Goodbye. [hangs up]
What did you say, Michael?
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
No, it's not possible.
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?
Michael.
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
Great.
No, Dwight; come in.
Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
Wha... excuse... why not?
[on speakerphone with Michael] Michael.
I don���t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
Best decision I ever made.
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
What?
Excuse me?
Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
This is my office.
Period.
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
Period.
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
You know what, Kevin?  Why don't you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...
OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
I can't, I can't-
This is a projection of the county's needs...
Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
Please, sit yourself down.
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
Thank you.
Thank God.
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
Oh, me too. Me too.
