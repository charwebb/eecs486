[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
Well, it���s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ���Cece��� is two letters and ���Astrid��� is... I mean, there���s even some adults who -- who -- who can���t spell it.
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you���re a princess. Mommy, you���re a superstar. Mommy you���re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
You son of a bitch. You���re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.
Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
It's not Kevin's child.  Can't possibly be.  I mean, I don't know what I would do.  Sue... icide?
I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
