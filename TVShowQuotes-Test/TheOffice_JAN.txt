I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
I don't care how your day was Michael.
You don't flash around a newborn baby.  Don't you know that?
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
