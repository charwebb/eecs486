Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?
It costs what it costs.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That's good.  Oh, good job.
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
[on phone] Hello?
No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
Yeah.
We all checked in?
Ohhh, God.
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
Ok.
No.
Thank you.
A futon's not a sofa.
Okay.
Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
We have gone through this.
Hi.
[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
Wait, wait, what cartoons?
...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
Michael.
Michael.
This is my office.
I���m a very busy woman, so...
What would you do differently?
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Michael.
Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
Why did I hook up with Michael?
Michael, we discussed the IRS's regulations.
Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
So, what's Ryan doing here?
I didn't mean it. I was...
What? I'm sorry?
So-
Can we just move on to another question?
You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
I didn't...
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
[singing] What did you learn?
Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
... but it's very destructive.
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.
Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
What does that mean?
Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
[on speakerphone with Michael] Michael.
So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
Stop.
Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.
[on phone] You're broke?
Hi.
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
No I'm the princess, and the queen.
YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
Don't you know what I'm doing?
Does anyone want a drink?
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
[laughs] I think you can handle it.
What did I just say?
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
Astrid.
So... we're good?
I'm not going to do that Michael.
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
Michael.
Men love this one.
Please? Thank you. very much.
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
[on the phone] This is Jan.
Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
Where's Michael Scott?
