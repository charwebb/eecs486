Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.
You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
