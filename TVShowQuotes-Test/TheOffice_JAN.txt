You know, imagine... you were gay.
Michael. MICHAEL!
Good luck with your band.
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
Michael, please.
It was. Yes.
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
Goodbye. [hangs up]
Not too good.
Michael... maybe... I mean...
I have some ideas.
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
Michael.
I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
You had no right to do that, Michael.
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
Good.
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Are camera's there?
Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
Come on.
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
We'd been fighting for a while-
[Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight.
You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
Really?
Aw.
No.
Hello, Michael.
$300?
[thinks for a second] Where is it?
Well... well, we will.
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
You're
Brenda.
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
Why am I here, Michael?
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
Thank you.
I hate my life.
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
No, that's all right.
I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
Well, Michael, I underestimated you.
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
This is my office.
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky.
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.
How was your interview?
Excuse me?
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
Hi.
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
Uh... come on.
Let's just blow this party off.
Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
We saw Wicked.
Michael, don't panic.
I didn't mean it. I was...
Hello... Michael.
Oh.
Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
[on phone] Yeah, what?
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
Thanks.
Don't you know what I'm doing?
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
Okay, how dare you do that?
Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
How are you?
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
Oh yeah, Arizona's beautiful. Yeah. It's great to... great to see my sister.
