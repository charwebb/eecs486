I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
Now you're really not allowed in this session.
So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'
OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
Oh, yeah, I know. I don't... I don't normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it's Scottsdale... I was visiting my sister and...
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
You went to a bachelor party at work?
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.
[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
...and I have to get back to work.
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
