Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
Can we just move on to another question?
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
You son of a bitch. You���re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.
Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
