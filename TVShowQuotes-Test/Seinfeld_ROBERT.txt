I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.
You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in.
Oscar. A pleasure.
Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.
Wine collection.
Lovely. Wait, where is this taking place?
What should we play?
Jim, you alright? What are you doing?
Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this.
Where���s the Advil, Jim? I think I���ve hit my limit on the Tylenol ��� Oh.
Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son?
I���m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don���t use ballpoint pens.
Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she���s here today to see if there���s a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager.
Big Mac idea.  That sounds encouraging.
No games.
Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You���re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don���t even know my real name. I���m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]
Yes.
Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning.
I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we?
Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn���t you agree Andy?
You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby.
And what?
I am. [laughs] I'm a mess.
Vanilla? No no no no.  You���ll never guess in a million billion years you���ll never guess.
Ah.
To the kitchen. Onward!
So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?
Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag.
I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said��� [Andy walks out]
It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?
[more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face]
Have you seen a ghost?
Everyone. I���d like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.
My serve!
I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested.
Why would I���..?
Double.
[laughs] I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
It's the standard one. The one everyone has.
No.
Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we?
Thank you.
