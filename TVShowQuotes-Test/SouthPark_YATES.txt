Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. 

All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?

Does that look like a black guy to you?!

All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use.

Stand back, give him room!  Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?

So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?

So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!

You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?
