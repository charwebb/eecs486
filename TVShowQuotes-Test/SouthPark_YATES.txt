I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. 
I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.
We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!
So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!  Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!
Well those aren't left hands.  See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands.
That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!
This is... where the body was found.  Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.
