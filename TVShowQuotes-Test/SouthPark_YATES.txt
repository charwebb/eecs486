I love 'em, darling.

Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.

This is... where the body was found.  Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.

You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?

Excuse me!  Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?

You're right. We're sorry. This is serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his "Luckiest Boy In America" medal right away. 

Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him.

Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.

This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.

Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma?

Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?

So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!  Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!
