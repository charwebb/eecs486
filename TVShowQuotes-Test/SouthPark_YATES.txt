Yeah, that's right!

Jesus Christ! Cause of death?

Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down.

By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.  Let's go people!  We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!

Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.

Murphy, you inside?

Oh my God! This is terrible!  Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?

Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.

Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!

Little boy...  Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but...  we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.

So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!  Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!
