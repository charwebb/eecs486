Who's Bob Hope?
Well that blows.
A vacation.
I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
Hi, Michael.
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
Just put it in your pocket.
Oh, me too.
Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
Ryan used me an object.
That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
It's about a family. A real-life family.
Lame! What else you got, Andy?
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
Right, so?
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
I know, right?  Probably a lot.
So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
What the hell is a mallard?
I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
I do.
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
Whoo!
Oh, baby.
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
I guess.
Who was that?
So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
Yeah, shut up Kevin.
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
I don't get the reason for this party.
Thanks, Michael.
Here you go.
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
Lulu from The Fifth Element.
[shaking head]
[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again.
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
Oh yeah? Screw you too.
I mean that's a baseball term, right?
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
Yes, I told everyone.
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
Why?
Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
She could be.
Call your mom, Michael. [everyone talking]
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
I'm dying!
I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
It's true!
Josh Duhamel.
Screw you man. People like my stuff.
Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
I don't know if she was white.
No, I'm scared.
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
Are you going to happy hour later?
Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
Sometimes my bangs cover it.
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
Now he's never gonna come.
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
I love it.
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'
Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
