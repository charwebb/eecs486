You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
But it's your house.
Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.
(sobbing) I can't afford that!
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
Hey!! Help me!
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
Hey, what is that up that tree?
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
Hello Jerry.
You will!
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
I too am well.
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
Oh, that's real.
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
What about your bills?
Hey George, nice hat.
What kind of dog did you say it was?
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
Hello, Jerry.
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
Go girl!
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
My toilet's clogged.
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
After you.
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
I think he stealing our rickshaw!
(couple quick breaths) Shocking.
Just one bite?
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
Hello Elaine. Where are they?
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
Why? I'll tell you why...
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
What took you so long?
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
Alright, let's begin.
They're gonna beat me up!
All right. Bark.
(eating) hm.
(laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso!
Do we have a deal?
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
I can't. I'm goin' to a movie.
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
