(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!
(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
