Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Come on, let me try it on.
Wow, where did you get that?
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
(Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
Well my girlfriend had one.
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
What took you so long?
It's getting cold, it's getting cold.
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
Just one bite?
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
But it's your house.
Hi Babs
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
Is that Jerry's number?
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
Not that!
Yes, the banker!!!
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
Federal employee. Federal employee.
All right. See you later.
No. No.
Who is it.
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
Hello. What 's this?
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
He's out.
(sobbing) I can't afford that!
It was McDowell.
What for, you got your own.
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
Use me for what?
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
What're you doing?
Make us!
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
