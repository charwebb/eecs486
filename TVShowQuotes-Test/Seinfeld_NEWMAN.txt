Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
What kind of dog did you say it was?
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
