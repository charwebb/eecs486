(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!

And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
All right give it to me. let go ...
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
What kind of dog did you say it was?
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
