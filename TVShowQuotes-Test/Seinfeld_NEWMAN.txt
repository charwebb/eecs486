(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
All right give it to me. let go ...
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
