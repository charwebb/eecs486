And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
Ten cents!?
Use me for what?
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
What for?
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
All right. See you later.
One large jambalaya, please.
Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.
George?
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
Nevertheless, ...
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
...Aargh!
Yeah, but I though-
I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
That smell. It's still with you, huh?
Alright. Come back to my party, please.
Come on Kramer!
(whimpering) Tell the world my story.
Yeah, me too.
Hey!! Help me!
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
(Suggesting Jerry) Does yours?
(looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
(perks up) A pie stand? Where?
(sings) Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...
All right. Bark.
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
It's okay. A little crooked.
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
Yeah, but he's a fighter.
You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
Like Silkwood.
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
Oh, yeah, right.
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
All right, so it's me. So what?
Excellent. Excellent.
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
