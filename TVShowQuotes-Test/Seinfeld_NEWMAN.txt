Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
Hey!! Help me!
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
Shell.
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
All right, tell it.
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
A piece of crap.
Hello Jerry.
(looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
Bark.
Oh, yeah, right.
(fleeing to the bedroom) Damn!
Alright. Come back to my party, please.
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.
I knew you'd back out.
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
You're off your rocker.
Hi Babs
Vile weed!
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
Your nipple's showing.
Sometimes we don't get what we want.
Waaaaahhhh!
Oh, that's real.
You tried it?
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
Blast!
(laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso!
They're gonna beat me up!
Work? It's raining.
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
(Realizing he won) Yeah.
(perks up) A pie stand? Where?
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
(triumph) Let the collecting begin!
Come on Kramer!
Aww..
You are?
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
HELP! (Elaine enters.)
I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
Anything else?
Wow, where did you get that?
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
Ohhh!
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
Alright.
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
What took you so long?
Boy, thats the full size.
