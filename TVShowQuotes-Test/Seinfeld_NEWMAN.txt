Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
