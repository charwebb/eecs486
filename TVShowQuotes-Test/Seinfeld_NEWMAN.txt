(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
