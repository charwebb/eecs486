Hallo?

Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.

I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!

I didn't say "stop wastin' my time," Geraldo did.

Oh here comes my family now!

Just look into the author of "A Million Little Fiyabers," and you'll discover the truth.

Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!

Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great!
