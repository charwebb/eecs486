OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.
You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
