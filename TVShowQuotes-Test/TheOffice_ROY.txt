[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best!
No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
I'm not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam's art.  She's an artist and I appreciate that.  It's very moving and sexy.  The art.
No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
