It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
You think you can beat up Darryl?
I'm not gonna hit you or anything.
[to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off?
Oh, man.  Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or...
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
So I only use three?
Crazy day, huh?
Huh.
Hey, they're playing our song.
Are you mad at me now?
Alright, bye. [Pam looks around the office]
I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
Yeah? Let's get you into a tub.
Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
Engaged, yeah.
Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
So how's your day going?
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
Chicken or fish?
[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]
Yeah! That's great.
