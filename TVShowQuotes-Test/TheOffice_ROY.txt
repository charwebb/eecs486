Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
Hey there.
Don't yell?!
Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
At the party?
I was just kidding.  You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
No, it was Captain Jack.
I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?'
When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
Are they going to call the cops?
But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.
Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.
You said it was important, so... How's it going?
Thanks...aw.
You look good.
I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
Hey, baby.
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
Yeah, you too. Should be fun.
You look like you feel bad.
Sweet.
Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
