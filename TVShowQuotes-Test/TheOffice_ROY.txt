Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
I was just kidding.  You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
