Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]
One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.
Where did you go to school?
I'm not gonna hit you or anything.
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
You look good.
Sorry about that.
To my place?
He's in the office.
Wow.
You mean the thing?
So Pam's happy?
Come on [begins to tickle Pam]
No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
[Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
Huh, huh?  You're the best.  You're the best!
Yeah.
Hey babe.
What, you're mad at me?
I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
[to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.
