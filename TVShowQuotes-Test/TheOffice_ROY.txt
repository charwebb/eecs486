You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.
