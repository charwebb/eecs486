Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes.
We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?
I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.
Look at me! I'm Jesus! Would you like me to crap on you, Mr. Bush? 
Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength.
Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow?  ...Hello?
Do you have an opinion on global warming?
I can't say I approve of this, my children.
That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.
Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages.
Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you.
I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.  In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!
Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!
You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. 
Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again.
It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.
Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?
