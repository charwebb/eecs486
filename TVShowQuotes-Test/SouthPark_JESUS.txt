The entire Vietcong Army?

Aw, come on, Santa. You can't leave.

Uh, let's watch the language, people.

Oh.

No way, dude!

... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?

The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.

Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around.  Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay now, turn back.  It is now wine!

I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman. 

Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod "Do You Think I'm Sexy?" Stewart! 

Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?

Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.

Yes my son?

Good. Want some peanuts?

But--

We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.

He he hoo, get away! 

Oh yeah?? 

And heaven and na-

Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.

Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag!

Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!

Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.

But Santa... The weather outside is frightful

And heaven and nature sing...

But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.

What seems to be the problem, my child?

Please, Father. Do something.

God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.
