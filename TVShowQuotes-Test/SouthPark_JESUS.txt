... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish.
Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.
Aw, come on! I weigh more than that.
Uhhh... Hi.  Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.  We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver.
I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.  Next caller.
My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...
Oh. Kids, yeyou believe I can beat Satan, right?
All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. 
Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.
Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. 
Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. 
Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?
Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!
Shut the fuck up!  Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused. 
Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.
