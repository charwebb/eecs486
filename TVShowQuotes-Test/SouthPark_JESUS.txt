Nobody is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!

No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?

Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.

Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. 

You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help.

Away in the manger, no crib for My bed

Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod "Do You Think I'm Sexy?" Stewart! 

Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
