How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a 'zero' hand gesture]
I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another-
Gabe Lewis.
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just--[put's his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
Great.
I don't - it's just...
They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
Look at this, this is enormous.
I'm sorry. This can't wait.
...a lot of the time.
What's in it for GSL?
But you do. You are in charge -
Mm-hmm.
You're doing great. You know, so good.
I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it.
Chelsea's Mom: Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture.
Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
Hey.
And Gabe-y makes three.
I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,...
I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
We got it?
Are you still in love with Erin?
[on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]
You have to be a minority.
Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit...
Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
How many windows are there in New York City?
[dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
[stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]
Core���s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One ��� lengthen. Two ��� elongate.
Course I know.
At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your -
The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
[laughs, eventually Erin joins him laughing] Oh that would be scary!
They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
