Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val���
I got a tattoo for you.
I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.
Nudity makes me uncomfortable.
No, no, I'm-
No... How far away is the Sun?
But you do. You are in charge -
[reveals Stanley's moustache] Ah! Ha ha ha!
Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
It���s one of the most common fetishes.
What kind of music are you into, Peter?
[walks in] Gotta catch a plane.
So I got us a compromise. This movie's called 'Hardware'. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married...
Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
I don't - it's just...
Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.
Uh.
Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so...
No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays���
We just want to say how grateful we are.
Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
So leave.
Core���s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One ��� lengthen. Two ��� elongate.
Oh, I am so in.
They say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. So, you will find me on the Ab-Blaster. And then you will find me blasting...uh, a very nice young woman.
Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What's the most important appliance in your house?
How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
[to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]
Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open.
Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. [in Lincoln voice] Oh Mary this is wonderful��� Ok Mary stop your scolding.  I���ll be quiet. [aside to the audience] I need her like I need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] BANG!  Ooh [Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink ���DM does GB��� hat and runs off]
Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.
Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
What?
Whoops.
Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.'
What's in it for GSL?
Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
Five. Six.
Alright.
Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
