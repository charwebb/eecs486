I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...]
I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.
It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.
In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me.
Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open.
[laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your -
Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.' [laughter]
Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
[to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.
Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly]
This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
You know, there's this expression: Bro's before Ho's. And what that's short for is brothers before whores. Uh, I don't buy that. I would throw any brother under the bus for any whore. Woman.
Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.
I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
It's awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]
There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
