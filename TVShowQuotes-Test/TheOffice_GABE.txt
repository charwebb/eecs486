Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
What kind of music are you into, Peter?
Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
Uh, I think you���re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It���ll be upsetting if you don���t.
Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
[makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement.  The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull[bleep]. [laughter] 'Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.'
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
[sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
