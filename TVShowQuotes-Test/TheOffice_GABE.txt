Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
[to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just...[makes popping sound] like it's coming from my own head.
Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.
[sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
Ok final thing, and this is a fun one: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.
Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
[bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?
I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...
Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.
Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.
The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.
Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. [correctly pronounced 'say-ber']
[dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
They say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. So, you will find me on the Ab-Blaster. And then you will find me blasting...uh, a very nice young woman.
And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight.
[walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
