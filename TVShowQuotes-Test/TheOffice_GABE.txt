I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.
Speed set. One. Two.
Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?
Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.'
The puzzle is the clue.
Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just--[put's his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
I'm sorry. This can't wait.
Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.
Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.
That's for the other box.
You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no]
I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.
I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
Yeah.
When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
[to Val] Hey. You're welcome.
Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
Erin, are you even hearing this?
Uh, it was.
There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
Do you promise that?
I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.
Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
Did someone say girl talk?
Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!
Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. [correctly pronounced 'say-ber']
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
Was it Pam?
I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
No... How far away is the Sun?
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
That sounds like a promotion!
[lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Erin and I make great use of ours.
Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.
Yep! Waste not right?
I'm your boss!
