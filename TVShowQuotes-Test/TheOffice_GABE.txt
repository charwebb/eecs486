And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another-
You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
Number two: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.
I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling.
[following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]
Steve Martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, I'm fine. [grunts]
Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.' [laughter]
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.
At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your -
Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.
Um. I set my stuff up in there. So...  just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
[on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.
It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous.
And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.
Umm... 'You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here.' Ha.
Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. [correctly pronounced 'say-ber']
Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
