Tom, it's Tuesday morning now, and the outbreak of SARS in South Park has reached epic proportions.  The entire town has been quarantined by the federal government, nobody allowed in our out, which means, nobody can come to our aid.  It appears this town, and this reporter, are done for. Coming up next, choosing the right hair conditioner. What you don't know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle.
We've just had an incredible development here, Mitch. Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly, have all come out of the closet! 
This is Robert Pooner reporting live from Nebraska, where escaped convict Charlie Manson has walled himself up in a house.  We understand that there are hostages, and that the situation is critical, , so we would like to remind you all that this live hostage crisis is being brought to you by Palmoral Sun Block . Remember, if it isn't Palmoral, you're gonna get cancer.
Tom, it now appears that John Travolta is also in the closet, and he refuses to come out. Here with more details once again, is R. Kelly.
Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the Denver Sea Park where, believe it or not, dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale. 
Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device.
