(over the Braniff Airlines logo) Bye bye buh-buh-buh-buh-buh chicken!
The evil hate-filled Cthulhu, from a dimension far away.Flying through gates of madness and into your heart
Rabartu Smitu, Rabartu Smitu, tashiwa daisuki Rabartu Smitu. (Robert Smith, Robert Smith, I like you a lot, Robert Smith)
He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!
Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all
