Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free.I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.

Never-

He can bowl, he can drink, he can drink and bowlAlaba-ma Man!

Veins swell
You know me, Ellen
Enough to tell
Five steps, you're over

Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!

Chinpokomon Camp!I've got to buy a ticket!I've got to buy one! A ticket!I've got to buy buy buy!

(Jackin' it, jackin' it, jackin' it jack
Spankin' it, spankin' it, smackin' it smack
A whackin' it, whackin' it, whackin' it whack
Smackin' it, jerkin' it, smackin' it smack)
The cars are passin' me by, they're honkin', say hello.
