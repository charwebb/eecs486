I'm gonna jack it where the sun always shines. (He's gonna jack it)
Been spreadin' the word and now I need to ease my mind. (Jackin' it)
(Ohhhh...) Been plantin' them apple seeds and while the apples grow,
I'm gonna go out jackin' it in San Diego! 
(Jackin' it, jackin' it, jackin' it jack
Smackin' it, jackin' it, smackin' it smack)
I don't need no shirt, no, gonna take 'dem pants right off (he's about to jack it)
On such a bright day who needs underwear or socks? (Jackin' jack it)
(Ohhhh...) Been around God's country, and there's one thing I know. 
There's no better place for jackin' it than San Diego!
(Jack it, jack it, jackin' it jack

From his window there's a guy shootin' video. (Video of him jackin' it)
And if the good Lord Jesus comes knockin' on my door,
Just tell him that I'm jackin' it in San Diego.
