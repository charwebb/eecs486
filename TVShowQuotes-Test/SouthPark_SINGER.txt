The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.
Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free.I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.
