You told me you were going to make me into a woman!

No you can'- Hello? Hello!!  You told me you killed that freak egg!!

Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!

Okay, children, it's Wednesday! Time for an official egg check! Heidi and Eric?

That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God.

They passed this law behind our back! We need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay! That homosexuals cannot muddy our traditions! And there is only one way for us, all together, to make that message very clear! We need to round up three or four queers and beat the livin' hell out of them!  Come on, everybody! Let's get some queers, and some trucks, and have us a good old-fashioned fag drag!

What the hell?

Come on! 

No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, dead.

That doesn't matter, it's over.

Welcome to our class, Baahir.

Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you. All right, children, it looks like we have no more contestants, which means, the Talent Show is over! 

You saw a penis?!

...Pregnant?  Oh my God. Of course.  I haven't gotten to experience a period because... one of those truckers I slept with got me knocked up.  I'm pregnant, everybody! Hoh boy, now I can have an abortion! 

Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.

I can pay two thousand now, three more when the job is finished.

Mr. Governor, I will get you that study.

You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis.  Well what the?  Why... it's my penis.  My penis came back. But why?  I guess it's true. What's that old saying? "If you love your penis, let it go..."

Mrs. Garrison. I spoke to your associates on the telephone.

No, I mean the problem of head lice.  There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here.

Which one is he?? 

Mr. Slave, I am legally a woman now! If you wanna get married, you have to marry ME!

Whoa no!

Okay children, let's take our seats.  Today we will be continuing our study of economics. But first, we're going to hear from a motivational speaker. The state has sent over somebody to talk to you all about the dangers of drunk driving. Please welcome Stan's dad. 

I had a sex-chamge operation. My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life! See ya in class! 

Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
Guess that I'll never know how it all went wrong. How how how?
Well perhaps I should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago.

Yello?

It isn't fine! It has two daddies! You call that fine?! It may be fine on the outside, but inside it's confused and embarrassed! Look at the freak egg! It has two daddies!  Two daddies! Two daddies! Come on, class, let's rip on the freak egg! Two daddies! Two daddies!
