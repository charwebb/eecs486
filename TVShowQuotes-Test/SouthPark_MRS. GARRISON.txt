Bebe, you're paired up with Stan. Lola and Token, Red and Craig, and Esther and Bradley.  Now, I'm going to sign each of your eggs myself, so that we'll know it's the same one at the end of the week. That way if anybody cheats and tries to replace their eggs, we'll know, Eric.  All you have to do is make it to Friday with your egg unharmed to prove what great little parents you are.  Okay children, you can now take the rest of the school period to decorate your egg however you wish. Good luck, and remember, a dead baby means an F for the parents. 
Just look at all these little families
Newfound couples in a happy home.
It takes me back to another time
When I had a love of my own. 
Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
Love, so darn frail, you know? It shriveled and died. I don't know how.
Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
Guess that I'll never know how it all went wrong. How how how? 
Well perhaps I should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago.
Hello, Mr. Slave. 

Well, give us a kiss!

It's an egg.

Now how about our gay couples? Stan and Kyle?

Wendy, we're doing an experiment.  Here you go, boys. 

No you can'- Hello? Hello!!  You told me you killed that freak egg!!

We'll just see about this, you fudge-packin' fags!! I'll stop that gay-marriage law! 

Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.

Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not at home.

Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?

But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right?  Oh I'm so happy.

Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body!  A woman has a right to choose!

If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!

What?

I'm not gay! I'm a woman!

Aaand let's see who else we have here, uh...

You have to get an A, Eric. Here: I'll sign this new egg for you. We'll pretend this never happened, all right?  Just... put on the old hair, color in the same eyes... There we go, good as new.  Go enjoy the rest of your recess.

Okay, that was the Goth kids with "Talent Shows Are For Fags"

Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!

There it is!  No! Nooo!  No! No!

Children, children, we have a very special announcement.  Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing! Well let's give him a hand! 

Did I say something to you, sugartits?!

What the hell?

Oh, so is that it?!  You're just gonna walk out?! You men are all alike! Go ahead and find somebody who doesn't have a vagina, you fag! 

But, if you had such a study, a scientific study which proved same-sex couples are incapable of raising a child...

Hoh now, what makes you say that, Wendy? I'm sure two boys can handle an egg just fine...  And if not, we'll certainly prove a point to that goddamned Governor, won't we?

Well, wait, wait, it gets better. I've forgiven you for walking out on me after I had my sex change, and uh...  And I'm ready to take you back, Mr. Slave!

AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!!
