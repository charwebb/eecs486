Okay, students, change of plan!  You've all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs, but now we're going to mix it up a little. Wendy and Kyle will no longer be together.
Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!
Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!
You broke your egg?? Uh but you're partnered with a girl.
No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, dead.
You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you.
They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are! 
Yeah?! Well what kind of woman can't have abortions and bleed out her snatch once a month?! You made me into a FREAK is what you did! And I want you to change me back!
Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else.
Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair! 
Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?
Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!
Eric, you've never been anything but a problem for me! You're taking that egg! And if you break it again, I'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! Do you hear me?!
I have a little... problem I need taken care of. I heard you're the best.
Principal Victoria, it is wrong!  It is wrong and I simply will not do it!  I care about my students, and I will not fill their heads with lies!  I am NOT teaching evolution in my class!! 
Jealous of what?! I'm doin' this out of principle! To protect the sanctity of marriage!  Fags are gettin' married over MY DEAD BODY!! 
Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body!  A woman has a right to choose!
I can pay two thousand now, three more when the job is finished.
Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars.
