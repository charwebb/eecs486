Not anymore. I've been fixed.  Richard, hold on. I can explain.
I'm in pretty bad shape. My... leg is broken and my... left boob is leaking
What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?!
No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard!
Richard, come back, please!  Well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer!
Okay, children, this week we are all going to learn about parenting.  I'm going to pair all the boys and girls in class into couples, and give each couple...  an egg. You must care for and look after this egg just like a baby for one full week. If you break your egg, it means you have a dead baby, and if you kill your baby, you get an F. When I announce your names, please move and sit with the person you're paired with.  Heidi, you'll be with Eric.
Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?
Come back here, penis!  There you are! Got you!  Hey, you're not my penis.  Ogh!  There it goes! Stop you!

My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese. 
You're riiight. It's so simple! God is a spaghetti monster. Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened!  Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!
Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!
That's impossible!  Are you sure you didn't break it and switch eggs on me?! Where's my signature?!
Let's see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg, shall we?! Kyle, you are now with Stan! And Wendy is with Bebe! 
Yes, what is it?! I'm a little busy!
Okay, let's put our hands together for Jimmy Valmer. 
This sex change was a big mistake, okay?  I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted.
