Oh jeez, should I do it?! Should I do it?! Oh what the hell!  Wooo! Huhuh, wooo!
You told me you were going to make me into a woman!
Richard, come back, please!  Well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer!
What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!
Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage.
Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair! 
Oh I'm not... I'm not totally into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God.
Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken.
It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!
...Pregnant?  Oh my God. Of course.  I haven't gotten to experience a period because... one of those truckers I slept with got me knocked up.  I'm pregnant, everybody! Hoh boy, now I can have an abortion! 
Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff.
Okay, students, change of plan!  You've all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs, but now we're going to mix it up a little. Wendy and Kyle will no longer be together.
I had a sex-chamge operation. My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life! See ya in class! 
But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right?  Oh I'm so happy.
What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.
Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion. 
Now we will tally up the judges' scores and find out which act they hated the least.
Okay, children, it's Wednesday! Time for an official egg check! Heidi and Eric?
Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.
