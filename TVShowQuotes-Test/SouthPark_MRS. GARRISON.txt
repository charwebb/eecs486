Well, wait, wait, it gets better. I've forgiven you for walking out on me after I had my sex change, and uh...  And I'm ready to take you back, Mr. Slave!

Yeah, I've got one growing inside me. Now, are you gonna scramble its brains or just vacuum it out?  ...If you want you can just scramble it and I'll queef it out myself.

Okay children, let's take our seats.  Today we will be continuing our study of economics. But first, we're going to hear from a motivational speaker. The state has sent over somebody to talk to you all about the dangers of drunk driving. Please welcome Stan's dad. 

Mr. Governor, I will get you that study.

So you are saying that we're all related to monkeys.

It's like, my whole life has just been one big screw-up, you know?  I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I still feel like a man

What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.

Oh I'm not... I'm not totally into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God.

No you can'- Hello? Hello!!  You told me you killed that freak egg!!

What's the matter? You... afraid you can't do it? Can't say that I blame ya. That egg has caused me nothin' but problems since day one!  I guess... you're not as good as they say you are...

Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher! Mrs. Garrison! 

You all had head lice!  Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!

Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements.

But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman. This would mean I I'm not really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis!

All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.

Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.

That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God.

Then why are you scared of one little egg?!

If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!
