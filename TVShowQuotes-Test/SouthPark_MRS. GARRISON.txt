Come back here, penis!  There you are! Got you!  Hey, you're not my penis.  Ogh!  There it goes! Stop you!
You know what? I'm okay. Even though I'm not truly a woman, I think I still like the new me. I'd rather be a woman who can't have periods than a fag.  Hey guys! This girl is staying a woman! Who wants to pound my vadge! Girl power!
Oh boy, men will do just about anything to get a look at our tits, won't they? Men are all the same. My boyfriend walked out on me! Turns out he was a fag. But I've been livin' it up ever since, havin' sex with all kinds of different guys! Girl power!  You know, the strange thing is, I haven't gotten my period yet. Is there a reason a woman might miss her period?
Let's see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg, shall we?! Kyle, you are now with Stan! And Wendy is with Bebe! 
Hello, Mr. Slave.  Boy have I been busy. A woman's work is never done.  I got some tampons. I should be getting my period really soon. I hope I don't get too emotional and drive you crazy with my PMS.  Mr. Slave, I got&#160;!Mrs.somethin' for us, too.  Would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed?
Well, wait, wait, it gets better. I've forgiven you for walking out on me after I had my sex change, and uh...  And I'm ready to take you back, Mr. Slave!
Okay, students, change of plan!  You've all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs, but now we're going to mix it up a little. Wendy and Kyle will no longer be together.
That's impossible!  Are you sure you didn't break it and switch eggs on me?! Where's my signature?!
Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up! God damn it!  Stupid ass man! They're all the same! 
Good. Millie and Clyde, I saw yours before class.  Powder and Kenny?
So I told my gynecologist, "you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you!" 
Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you. All right, children, it looks like we have no more contestants, which means, the Talent Show is over! 
Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids? 
Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.
No, no, not like that! That's just silly. 
What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.
My scrotum!  That dolphin has my scrotum! Now let us in!
No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me?
All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay?  Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers
