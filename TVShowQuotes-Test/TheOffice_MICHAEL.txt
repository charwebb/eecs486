Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
You know what, guys?  It's none of your concern.  It was official business, so just...
Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.
NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked.  Thank you.
[same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
[laughing] Right!  [serious] And I take that as a compliment.
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? 'Raging Bull.' Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. [Michael opens his blinds and looks at Ryan in the parking lot] There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. [Calls Ryan on the phone, Ryan doesn't pick up after seeing that Michael is calling] Oh, we're playing phone tag.
Oh man.  It's not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.
Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.
[Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?
You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these [giving Toby two middle fingers] and call me in the morning.
Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
[Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who's Pat?
Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
[rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
[carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst...
Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.
Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
Not it's not, there's some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out.
I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?
Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.
[Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this.
You know, David.  I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
[points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little 'Good Will Hunting' situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.
Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of 'em.
Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
If everybody... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...'
And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, [Michael is seen whispering to Jim, then Pam] that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.
Why? I'm not your father. [Erin looks sad] All right.
Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn't actually have cerebral palsy. Okay.
Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.
This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.
Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I'd like you to smile. I'd like to see a big smile.
[walks up] Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.  How do I look?
Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
[in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. [Meredtih sits Indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of Michael] Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.
In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can't do this.
Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.
Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.
Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
To jump start a car, first pop the hood.  Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.  Then you take these and clip them wherever.
[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.
I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]
I have to know whether you're serious or not.
Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh... Do you have laser tag down there or something?
People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.
[banging on the glass] Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don't talk to them.
What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
Office romance. For example, Pam and I are dating, do we have to disclose that?
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
[Toby running to get on the cruise] Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat.
All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
Don't you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that's able to eat up that other emails? I read about something like that. Well, I am in America and I am online, so I do think it involves you. Uh-huh. And if I were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler? I'd... Yes, I will hold.
Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually. [pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them]  There you go.  Use it in good health.
You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
Yeah. [singing to music] 'Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you.' Here you go.
Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!
[comes over to hug them both] My girls.  There they are. [Pam walks away]
So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...
[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?
You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?
Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
[on microphone] That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin' off to?
No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!
I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
[through the car window] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
[to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want.
Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]
So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
[fumbling for words] Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines 'wedding' as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride 'Mawige...
Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver's seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you're dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman's clothes.
Strike while the iron's hot. A joke always works.
No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
[Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think?
I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?
What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside.  Don't... please...
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?
Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...
Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.
She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.
[sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey!
Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE: log. Lost log. Found log.' '10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points.' That's on the wrong page.
I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.
I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.
I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
I'm not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
No, neither am I. We both look good.
I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can't do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.
Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why don't you have a seat?  [Phyllis sits] Let's all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok!  [in Michael Clump voice]  When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.  [kneels down in front of Kelly, Dwight tries to help him down, Michael shouts gibberish at him]  Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair.  Come on, stand up on your chair.  Stand up, stand up, stand up.  Somebody help her.  Here we go. [Kelly stands up on her chair] Ok, I want you to look at her.  She's a beautiful Indian woman.  Why?  What makes her beautiful?
Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
All right, don't break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?
Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...
This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.
[Jim has the ball] Jim! Jim! Right here! [runs into the elbow of the guy guarding him] Ow! God! Hold it!
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, 'You're fired.' [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed.' It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed.'  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, 'You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want.' But that's unrealistic, so...
Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
I know. Ugh, that is so annoying. [makes fart noise] Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I've forgotten about? Just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, 'Brr, brr.' And I went, 'Argh, Argh.' You know? Anything? [shakes her head 'no'] Well, if you think of something, let me know. 'Cause I like to know. 'Cause I'm going crazy.
Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that.
Well, yeah, but you don't need the brochure.  The brochure is up here [indicates head] and it's in here. [indicates heart]
Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.
Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!  Let's keep it moving!  Let's keep it moving!  Toby, everybody!
I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...
Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
Uh, they look that good? Wow. [Mike Myers voice] Oh, Pam please behave. Mike Myers, genius. Um, no actually I got them at a fancier place. Target.
[mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
Yeah! [office erupts in cheers and applause and hugs] It's a Christmas miracle!
Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The 'Hottest in the Office' award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can.
I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
You're a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.
Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.
You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?
Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table]
No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.
I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.
Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That's -
Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.
You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you're not doing your job. Why don't you just resign?
Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
[in conference room] Here... [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]
Today I'm headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention. [makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream] Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.
Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
No, King is higher. Then Ace. I am the Ace bee.
That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I'm just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.
Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at-- [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that's... [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
[puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]
Well I believe in love at first sight.
What table should we take?  So many to choose from.
Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about.
I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.
You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'
Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?
If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
[on microphone] What? Was I not supposed to say it? [Jim unplugs mic] What? Turn it back on.
[in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.
I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
[in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand]
Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.
Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?
I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.
Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
No. I said I hate the, the style.
No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so...
Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
[throws the sack of garbage onto the floor] Eight Years.
OK, I am really going to do this.
God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.
Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.
Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?
Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management. [takes deep breath] Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today... And you don't worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... And there are no roofs in coal mines.
No, no, no.  I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
[on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob]  You guys are going so slow...
Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
Let's go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]
You know what this is like?  I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably 'freedom.' At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.
I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar]
Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]
Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
Because I wanted you to come to me and say, 'Wow, he is so great.' And I was gonna say, 'Well, it's in the genes.' And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
Oh, man. How much time do you have?
Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
You can not, I have a thing tonight.
If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.
That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.
Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
[to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...
I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.
Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
I'm a smart guy.  I'll figure it out.
That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.
Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don't know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?
Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.
- since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?
Who's got Roy? [Jim does a behind the back move around Roy for the basket]
So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
Yeah.  In all climates.  It's going to be worldwide.  And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That's where you come in.
Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?
[playing Jan's message] 'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.'
Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.
Here we go, fourth time's a charm. 'Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying?
If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.
I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.
Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
I know what you want to ask me. 'Did your mom ever see you naked?'
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  [whispers to Jim]  What's this about?
Hello hello. Top of the morning to you!  Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! [Grabs and pours Kevin-esque scoop of M&Ms into his coat pocket] Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.
[mug falls off Michel's desk and smashes on the floor] God... damn it, Dwight! That's great.
[Creed is using the toaster as a mirror, and touching up his hair with a Sharpie and a comb] The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them.  And old enough to know the difference between the two.  I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls.  But old enough to know better.  I'm at a perfect age.  I could die now.  But I won't, because I am young.
Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.
Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.
Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, 'How could they do this to us?'
Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. [claps]
All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  [sees man in a turban outside] Oh my God. Ohhh. [dials phone number] Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.  Oh, we have a serious problem here. [goes out onto office floor] Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.  Pretend you're not here.
Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?
Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
Good. Here come the sharks. [they imitate jaws theme sounds and Dwight makes shark fin on his forehead]
Well, comedy's kinda my thing. Watch this, here's Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Right. [Continues with cod German] Me, me, me, me, me, me. Curly Joe Hitler. [laughs]
You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?
I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
[English accent] Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.
Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
[Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What's the matter?
Can I just stay here and never go back?
I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry.
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!  No deal.  Not with Michael Scarn, FBI.  Michael Scarn doesn't make deals.  Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later. [blows on his fake gun]
I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!
I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.
Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...
Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?
If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
[to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
[in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.
Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.
Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. [turns off tv]
Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]
Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.
Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?
[sighs] Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we're gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn't matter, it's an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.  [to Oscar] Adios!
Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.
I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.
I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash]
Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man.
You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. [Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party.
And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
[watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that?
I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that's right.  It's a baby, see?
No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word.
Don't... is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.
Cause he slept in the car a couple times.
Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.
Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest.
Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.
Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust]  Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, 'Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work.'  What a jerk.  He's... You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.
Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.
I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.
No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?
Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.
He's in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
[on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]
We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?
You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
You listen to me. You listen good. You are are
[laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... 'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including 'Stanley is having an affair.' It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
Pac-man [imitating the noises of the video game Pac-man eating dots]
Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]
Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.
Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
Everybody? If... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...'
[on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.
Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.
He will be ushering you out.  [starts laughing]
Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.
Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.
Only one that I was kind of worried about.
Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
Rock and roll. [they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone]
I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay. [walking into office] Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.
Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away.
Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball?
[grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
[sighs] Let's call him and get the website.
Why are you helping her?  You're not even dating.'  She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...
Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. 'You can't be on the team', 'You can't move on to second grade'. Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that?
[in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
I am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.
[on phone] No, no, no, I'll talk to her.  I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes.  Alright, by pickle.
[holding up his 'World's Best Boss Mug'] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.
Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
[after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us...
Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.
Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. [groans]
I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.
You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  ...  Only on the rarest of occasions...
Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.
[on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
[as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.
You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... [mimicking Gabe] 'I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!' [normal voice] Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!
I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
[on the roof] My life!  Oh, my life...
Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]
I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?
Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
[looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.  [singing]  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin' on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I can't explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on.  Tender love is blind---
Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on ...
Boom!  Freeze!  Michael Scoon, FBI.  You know what you did.  Boom! Boom! Boom! [shoots at Pregnant Girl and another actor]  Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you?  Didn't ya!?  Well, you didn't, because I know where ya hid the diamonds.  I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.  [another actor steps in]  Boom! Boom! Boom!
Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.
Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can't pay for your college.  But you don't have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. [students perk up] Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.
Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
[singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back [Christian laughs]
Then I will name your team the Red team.
Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
[on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
[at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all.
[laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
Yes!  We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]
Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer]
[in his office playing with a Dunder Mifflin Truck when it drops and the 'head' of the Truck comes off]
No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
[moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?
The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.
I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.
And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.
Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith's problem?
[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
No, no.  I need two men on this.  That's what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
[ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?
Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting's not over.
Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. [Dwight leaves] Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.
Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! [gets in backseat] Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You.
OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.
[to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.
[Dwight looks confused to the camera] Were they in the missionary position? [Holly laughs]
No, no, no!  That's enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.
Hey.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
Are we going?  [Dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown] Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready.
OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's]
I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone]
[Dwight and Stanley are in sumo suits] Ready! Go!
When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. [takes off sweater to reveal tuxedo] I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
[clapping] Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.
Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.
You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don't believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.
Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
And - [Jim seals box with tape, rips covered with stickers] Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. [cell phone starts ringing from inside box]
Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision.
I don't wanna talk about it.  I just wanna hang out, just be one of the guys.
No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
I can't hear you! [less applause]  Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be...
And I've never gone hang-gliding.  And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
David told me on the phone. David told me.
Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'
[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.
No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  It'll cure all of your 'Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother' and fixes all occurrences of 'I don't really see them together'.  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.
OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.
[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]
Look at his face! Look at his face!
...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]
I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.
I had a great idea until you ruined it.
Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot. [hurries out]
Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man.
Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.
You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] 'You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!'
When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind. Was I well-loved? Check. Did I express myself? Did I let my light shine through? Check. Will an attractive woman cry at my funeral? Check. Probably more than one. Check. Check, check, check, check. Lastly, did I achieve success and own real estate? And when I close on this condo, I will be able to check that one as well.
Alright, I'm gonna, uhh, get a cup of coffee.  Do you want some coffee er-
Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
[on the bus] Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
Okay. Alright. Cool.  See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby's desk] Oh, she's cute.  Cutie-pie. Back to work.
W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
[entering break room, to Maurie] You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.
Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
That's right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.
Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
[clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...
Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... [Jim draws a triangle around Michael's diagram] ... I have to go make a call.
I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
[singing] Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I'm never coming back.
There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.
Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight?
Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
[holding a chainsaw] And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.'
It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls].  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that
Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.  There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor [Oscar vigorously shakes his head]  What?
Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?
Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
[enters] [in a gruff voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
How can you give up my diary like that?
We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
[staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.
I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...
I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.
No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...
I mean, you just come in and you're just negative...
Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody'd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently]
That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--
Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?
And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.
Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
Thanks, Kevin. Um... [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan's pregnant belly]
I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play.
If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...
And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin? [clip montage over Daryl's Dunder Mifflin jingle]
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it.
This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now.
Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
What part of 'I need to pee' do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.
Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.
Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
[slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.
They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out.
I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!
I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh---  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!
Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.
Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
[hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.
