No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.
I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey!
I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?
No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.'
What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.
Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.
[whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
He said, we have been sold. [upset murmurs]
By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'
I can't wait to be a father.  I'm going to smother that baby.
Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.
Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend.
I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
Push free play til tomorrow morning. [to Grotti] Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.
See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  It's just the first... girl that popped into my head.  I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.
I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...
Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There's a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.
Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?
Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on.
Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?
You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.
Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
Could I count myself down please, Dwight. Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...
It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied. [puts lei on Angela]
[holding up a Dundie and pretending it is talking] Hello. I'm Michael Scott. I'm the best boss in the world.
Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that's...
Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge]
No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter]
In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. [holding up photo of him and Wallace] You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.
Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.
You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!
No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
[singing] Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise...
So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don't care.
Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.
We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?
[climbs under desk] Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from 'Look Who's Talking.' What am I thinking? [Laughs] Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.
You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...
Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back.
[still talking like a robot] I... was just learning... to... love.
No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?
So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]
[Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping]
Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...
Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.
No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
[turns to address Jim and Pam] No way.
The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. [camera pans to different people in the office] Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So... [phone rings, computer chimes, etc.] That's Uh...
I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...
Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at... [reading computer screen] Packer@DunderMifflin.com.
No, no, no!  Seriously, I don't mind sharing.
On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.
Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth]
Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old.
Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. [giggles]  It was hysterical.
Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.
Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay.
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? [Angela raises her hand] Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... [Stanley is laughing] Oscar, you're gay.
No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car?
Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.' This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.
And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.
Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]
Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
[breathless] All right.  Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee]
No, I don't want to wear a bra.
And it also helps if you've had five shots.
He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it's go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
[Roy bumps Michael to get around him] OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul.
Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
No.  I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
[slurping] Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?
Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...
Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies
Can I just stay here and never go back?
Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?
No, no. I know you didn't intend to, but I just I got the idea and I, uh, I just don't it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something. You know? And then prey on their emotions.
She's Pam's best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?
Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.
No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
[Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how we're gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.
Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...
It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.
Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
This office is cursed.  [sighs]  And we need to do something about it.
Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can't go through with this.
Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.'  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been [makes slashing neck hand motion] swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.
Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
[on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done.
[Grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat] Oh, great.
Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
[entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.
Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
No, neither am I. We both look good.
You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Not it's not, there's some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out.
Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.
Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
Business is like a jungle.  And I... am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  [smiling] Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head.  We don't have the technology.
[screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.
[looking at Creed] Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go. [lifting the car seat high above his head] Lion King!
Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.
And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.
Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
[to Brad coming out of the bathroom] Hey.
I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
[sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, 'I have cancer.'
No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.
China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.
Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! [snickers] So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That's how I want every day to be.
All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say 'Boo' because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
[on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Who's that? Who's that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures]
OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
I'm not gonna lock my door.  [door closes. Then clicks locked]
Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak.
Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?
We have a little song prepared for you.
Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.
What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.
I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!
Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely.
The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course.  It's where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.
Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. [points to Pam's' pregnant tummy]
I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
[singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...
Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
[in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.
These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend! [sings] Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.
I lied to myself too.  I'm not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don't know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.
[under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.
[leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.
I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs]
I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.
Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.
I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.
Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 2:30 to 3:15.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guy's night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.
No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
[to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said...
Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.
Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.
Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five o'clock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home.
That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.
Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.
This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?
Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?
You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now.
Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
[imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs]
With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.
That's a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.
Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
That makes sense because he has elfish features.
I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]
[looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...
Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  [Kevin groans]
[meeting Ed Truck in parking lot] Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin' back.
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
No! No No. No. 'My Stumps.' Like 'My Humps' but a guy with no legs.
I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?
Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let's go!
My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]
Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. [laughs] Okay.
They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.
Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!
It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]
This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone.
It's just... brrrrrr... It's 'Amazing Race,' Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.
Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha.
Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?
Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!
Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.
I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun. [gasps]  That's why I always start with a gun, because you can't top it, you just can't.
Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
[sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.
This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.
No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.
That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.
And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples.  Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?
[cleaing throat] You're a jerk. Dwight's a jerk!
If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.
Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!
You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
[to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. [Erin laughs] I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud]
That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.
Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
[Pam returns] This is one of our staff.  This is Pam Beesly, [takes piece of paper from Pam] receptionist extraordinaire.
No, no, no, no. No, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, here's the deal. Um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.
I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That's strong!
When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-
[sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.
[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
[putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]
Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.
Do you think I'll get any new ones?  I could... [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight]
Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
[coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening!
You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?
[to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal.
Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.
You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.
Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
[hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]
Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]
[laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.
Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
Yeah, it's routine.  I'm just a little bit scared.
[Creed is using the toaster as a mirror, and touching up his hair with a Sharpie and a comb] The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them.  And old enough to know the difference between the two.  I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls.  But old enough to know better.  I'm at a perfect age.  I could die now.  But I won't, because I am young.
Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]
No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.
Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
[watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
[others  start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm... whoa.
Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That I'm a robot? [robot voice]  I will destroy everything in my path-
Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. [Stanley looks angry] But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! [Stanley slowly walks over, angry] Come on up here you sick bastard.
Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
It is your problem.  That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.
Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time.  It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be torture for you.
[in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!
Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.
When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can't help but feel partially responsible.
I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
Here's a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway. [Man steps back inside his house and shuts the front door] All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool.
[shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael]
I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?
Just drive faster. I want to get back.
Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
Don't mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk]
Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
If everybody... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...'
There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.
No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
What would you like for Christmas little boy?
I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary]
Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
It's the only time he can do it.  2:30 to 3:15.  It's going to be great.  We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.
[Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
I was going to be a bottle capper.
Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that's called sales.
You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.
Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. 'Schindler's List' parody. ... That's not appropriate, no.
...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.
I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible.
Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
[puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.
Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four: Failure is not an option.
You can not, I have a thing tonight.
You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]
That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.
You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?
Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide.
Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-
Pam, it's Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.
Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]
Uh, I have a pajama party.  At the Playboy Mansion.  With the bunnies.
I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face]
OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.
[whispers] Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave]
Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela]
[removing tie] Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything. [puts on backwards golf cap]
Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, 'Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.' His words.
This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
[points at camera] They're gonna have... You can't say that, all right?
Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.
Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?
I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
I'm not changing that, it's the best one.
No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls.
So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.
Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'
Thank you, Al Gore... for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn't do that ten years ago?
Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.
Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.
Yes! Thank you. God. She gets it. [laughs] We just picked the best one right? Just had it.
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I'm gonna get married and I'm gonna have kids.
Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
Cool, so maybe hook me up  with some Fleebulls and some Hive.
Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down.  You and I-
[reaching to open door] I'm gonna do it.
Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.
I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
[on video] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]
Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.
Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
[as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great. [walks into office]
You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
I had a great idea until you ruined it.
Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.
This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.
Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
[exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
I need somebody to pick a card. [Dwight raises hand] One of the new people, please? Tony? [Tony walks away]
Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?
[accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection.  We still don't know who the murderer is.  [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can't do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?
Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch 'Lazy Scranton'.
[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?
My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?
Oh, no, no, no.  You're good.  It was clerical.  You're good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
[gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good?
OK. Do you want me to repeat that?
[clears throat and stands] Ladies and gentlemen of... the... table.  I would just like to say what a joy it is for me to be here today, but frankly, at my age, it's a joy to be anywhere [no one laughs].  I'm only forty-four, so I'm not old, and I guess that doesn't really play.  But the point is, I have a sense of humor.   And I implore you all to have a sense of humor as well.  Jan, David, my wonderful girlfriend [indicates Jan, then turns to David Wallace], my gorgeous company... Why don't we all just take a big deep breath... and just relax [breathes in deeply, no one responds].  Good.  That feels good [sits].  All right.  Everybody feel better?
Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why don't you just go... away?
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
No, not at all come on in. [Toby signing the birthday card] No, no. You can't. No, red hair is my area. We have it on tape, so...
There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.
You know what. I, um, I'm out the door. I'm going to a meeting. Pam, I'm headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go.
Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about?
[mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office]
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?
Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin'?
I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
Hey, if there's anything else I can do, just let me know.
How can you give up my diary like that?
So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You.
[sighs]  I wasn't talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?
Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
Some people need dozens of friends to say, 'Hey, look at me, I'm popular.' But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.
[from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is...
Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
Oh, Okay.  Okay.  Just...[Michael takes down banner, clears throat]  Well, our old friend Ryan Howard is back, and we're going to give a little presentation about the future of our company.  So please listen up. [awkward pause] All right.
Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
[filming video] Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not.
Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]
No! You idiot! [hangs up] Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.  [redials]
Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame.
Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic]
You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
Do you want me to find out what it says?
I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, 'I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.' Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball.
[reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.
[pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]
Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
[on microphone] That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.  [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.
We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]
No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
Keep it up. And there's Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.
Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
[on microphone] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?
Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
[laughs] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]
[banging on the glass] Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don't talk to them.
I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.
It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. [Angela claps] Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget.
Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider.
Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry.
Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.
Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now we're wasting tape.  I'm gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?
[watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No.
Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!
You know what?  This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people.  I don't care if it's pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.
Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.
BlackBerry.  Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit?  You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.  [drops BlackBerry on desk]  Excuse me while I type on my Banana.  I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.  [thinks] Apple. [nods]
Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.
And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
[singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.
On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.
Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.
Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?
Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
