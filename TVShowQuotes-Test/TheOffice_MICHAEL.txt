Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey!
OK, just remember to keep breathing.
[still watching video of Ryan] Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.
Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?
Stop talking all at once!
And I'm very angry, and I want...
Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?
I...
Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?
You're right. What do you mean though?
Best night ever.
[grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
I have a conflict with that.
Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
Aw, come on Dwight.
Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
MONEY!
We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.
Oh my God, something's happening.
They are into style.
Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That I'm a robot? [robot voice]  I will destroy everything in my path-
In-grown hair.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.
Why?
And I've dated four women in the last--
No no no no no no no. [accent] I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?
He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
Who eats eight protein bars?
Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
All right, I'll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs]
Devon, wait, please.
This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them.
And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---
You are lying right now.
Erin, what about my keyboard? [Erin hits a button on an electronic keyboard, playing a beat] Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
Well, he
She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.
Okay, put it on my card.
Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.
Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this.
[notices Karen's pregnant] Oh my God. Is that Jim's?
Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
Ah. Small?
[to camera] Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game.
And the last guy says 'No, hairy body'.
Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.
Okay.
That's what makes him classy.
We can do...
[slurping] Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?
I really appreciate it.
Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
Ok.
Bluh.
No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
[under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.
Come on, I'm going backwards.
Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.
No.  No, I meant about being single today.
Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
Yeah.
Can I sit down for a second?
This is going on the outside.  The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner.  Do not tape those on.
That's possible. Look into that.
Okay, field trip's over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?
Nope, you cannot use it.
my weekend was bad so far.
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?
Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.
Great. Thank you.
Don't drink and drive.
Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.
No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
Oh, yeah.
Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?
[with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please.
We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. [David Wallace walks in] Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!
You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
350
Pam?
How is that possible?
Whoa, whoa!
This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. 'Schindler's List' parody. ... That's not appropriate, no.
All right. Jack Nicholson for birdie.
Absolutely.
No.
This way to the partay bus.
Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
You're... You're welcome.
Why?
No, but I'm saying hypothetically if we were dating...
Okay...  Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
[confused] Stanley was on your group date?
I'm not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
[as the power and lights come back on] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
Lifeline.
Sad, something to break.
And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn't actually have cerebral palsy. Okay.
Yes.
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
Because we work together.
I... love it!! Haha, come on!
Are we over budget?
I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
Alright.
Maybe.
You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.
Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
[sighs]
Um, you're in accounting...
Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton... Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one.
Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
Good. Great.
Ok. All right.
Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.
No, I'm not calling your weirdo cousin.  Twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.
I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. [all seem to be in agreenment] And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.
They sent a limo.
Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. [holding up photo of him and Wallace] You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
A fairy princess. You're very... .
Whoo!
Phyllis?
[clears throat] Hey, there!  Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin.
What can I do?
[whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking]
Yep.
Blowing up balloons I thought.
Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic]
We have a little song prepared for you.
Alright. Bye.
David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.
[singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die?
What's a bad idea?
Ahoy, matey.
Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We'll, see you when you get out.
Yes.
It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
Is there something that you would like to say to me?
Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.
He wears glasses. Did you know that?
OK?
I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.
Can I kiss you?
Okay, security guard.
Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.
I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.
Right.
I will take care of that.
Really.
It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.
You leaked it?
We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?
Terrific. Good.
No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.
Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?
It's a surprise.
Well, hobbies--
Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?
Yes.
Hmm..
Yeees.
Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
Ok. See you soon.
Yeah, oh, hey.  Did he call?
Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?
So far, these are my leads.  A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.  It's a start.
Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
There an accident? Somebody hurt?
['Rita Klondike 507' is written on an index card] All right, time's up!  Pencils down.  Please pass your future Mrs. Michael Scotts forward.
OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at... [reading computer screen] Packer@DunderMifflin.com.
Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
[under his breath] Oh, Christ.
Really?
Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: 'Hey um, you're poor.' 'Well hey, you're mama's dead.' That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.
Nothing.
So, okay.
What'd you have, Stanley?
Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
[whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth]
He gives the best back rubs in the office.
Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, 'So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?'
For Kelly, that seems a bit much.
Oh, have you not?
William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I'm paraphrasing here, 'Love doth be poison.' Brilliant. And a lot of people don't give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes.
Thank you.
Good, good, bro.
No.
When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
Oh, Carol. Hello, how are you?
Not it's not, there's some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out.
[taps on desk and starts to leave his office] Do you want this open or closed?
How would I know?
Pam? Pam?
No Gould?
It's for your trouble.
Okay.
I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did.
Should have done this a long time ago.  Tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters.  Uh, uh huh.  Wow, like Kevin, rating the best bars in Scranton?  Poor Richard's number seven?  Idiot.  Stupid load.  [phone rings]  Yeah.
What? Wha? You said ten.
Oh, new record!
Who's Amanda Bynes?
Thank you!  Thank you!
I'll kill you man!
Just let go.
[also in a poor Australian accent] The Dundies!
Really?
Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
I have got big balls.
[nods uncomfortably] That--
Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.
Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
[entering on a Segway Scooter] I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
It's my sumo suit.  I just didn't inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
I made it sterile.
A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
No. Not me, him.
How's this place treating you?
It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.
OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
Gay.
Well, maybe I did.
Okay. That sounds good. [puts banana in toy mouth that's in his mouth] [laughs] Yes. Actually, today's a good day to do that.
Well, I... it could be either of us.
I don't understand.
I do.
Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha.
Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
Come on.
Because of all the good work you've done.
Argh, why are you all...
No.
No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right?
Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
Sounds awesome.
Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
Yep. Oh... wow.
Thank you.
You enjoy the second act.
You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.
Hi, Mema. It's Michael.
Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
No.
So it's not a free fall?
I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
[looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
That's insane!
I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
I never said you could do that.
Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs]
Yes, I don't...
Earlier today.
Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course.  It's where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.
[leans across to Pam whispering] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
You're what, like, 12?
I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions...
How many miles did he do last year?
Thank you.
[having walked up to the front] Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. [pulls the string to request a stop, makes a dinging sound]
I know you are. Knock, knock.
[on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
That's not the point.
[exhales] Well then... I am glad you're ok.
Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'
And you're okay with that?
Well, just shhhh... just just...
Me? Okay.
... proud.
Hey, whatcha gettin'?
I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]
I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.
We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said 'did I stutter,' and I said 'wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?' It was joking, Toby, alright?
Damnit, Phyllis!  I'm sorry.  [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?
Testify.
No.
Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
Please just check.
Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna win.
Check it out.  Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee.
Yup.
For me, too. You embarrassed me.
Yes!
Okay. How's yoga?
He did talk about a fire in the warehouse...  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
[Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good.
[yelling] All right, everybody in the conference room!  I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW!
I had to do that.
Go! Oh, that's nice.
What?
No... that's...
All right.
Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
Just sit down!
Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
All right, I'm sorry. God.
I saw you program it in.
Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.
I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
Is who a Michael what?
That was a really good choice.
Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
What's happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.
Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
All right, just...
Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!
You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you.
[gasps] It is?
A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.
People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one.
Live and let live.
[walks in] Morning everyone.
And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
Thank you.
No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I'm not gonna call Jan.  She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?
Was it nice?
Here we go, fourth time's a charm. 'Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying?
I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to...[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.
Yep.
I just don't want you to.
No.
Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. [turns around to find Toby standing behind him]
Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.
Yeah, Have a seat.
Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
[Giggles.]
That's ridiculous.
So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he's in love with her... [phone rings]
More than a friend, a co-worker.
Who hasn't?  Good.  Good!  What else?
No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.
[laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, Okay, here's a good one. Um...'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
Yes, it is.
Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.
Hey.
[points at woman] What does that look like to you?
We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]
All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
I probably will, why do you ask?
Okay.
Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust]  Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, 'Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work.'  What a jerk.  He's... You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.
Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.
[exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I'll talk to her.
Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
To the right?
Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
You're weird.
Let's get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in]
No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...
I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.
I like his hair.
Morning, Pam.  Hey.
Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
[annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby?
Oh really.
Andy, what's the problem?
[Pokes Ryan with a sex toy.] Gotcha, oh! [Phone rings.] Yes?
Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.
Okay. You've just lost my business.
Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]
Oh, stop it Dwight.
Guilty! Guilty as charged!
It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
Oh, no, no, no. No.  It's stupid.  You'd hate it.  I hate it.
Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
I do.
Yes.
Calling from... [Ryan hangs up]
They could be shrinking.
[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?
No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.
No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
I am not a mind reader, David.
The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
[sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.
It's just... brrrrrr... It's 'Amazing Race,' Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.
Really? Wow.  That's over $200 a year.
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car]
No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
Yes.
No, no. I get it, I get it, I get it. A child is born, 'Oh, oh-hum.' A beautiful sunset, 'No, I'll catch the next one.' Right? Unicorn walks into the office, 'Oh, do you have an appointment?' [laughs] Okay, look Pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you're doing wrong. You are the voice of this company, right? And when clients call and you're not smiling they can hear that in your voice. It is a real turnoff.
Yes you can.
[watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.
Hey, that's good.
I'm not going to give it to you.
We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I've never been a fan.
I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!
I'm sorry?
They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.
I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
Mmm.
So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken]
[as Homer] D'oh!
You should give them a call. Check that out.
Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
Stanley.
Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music.
I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that.
OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
It's been a rough couple of weeks.
No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
Nothing.
Come here please.
Yes.
Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man.
She poses.
Is that what we're going for now?  'okay?'  We used to go for 'pretty good.'
Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
That is a great idea JB.
Shh...
No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying 'Dwight did it!!'] You?
I like it.
Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump.'
Well, no.
What
Do you think they have any s'mores?
Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.
Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
Welcome back!  How was your vacation?
Yeah, that's right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.
Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
Hello.
Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.
AIDS.
I'm good.
What table should we take?  So many to choose from.
Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
Yes.  I have bags under my eyes, and I can't go to New York like this!  What do I do?  What do I do?
About what?
Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.
I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
Woo!
It's a celebrity tournament.
It is. Ok.
Thank God.
That does sound fun to me.
I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
OK, come on everybody, go time. Pam let's go.
[on phone] Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
[extended Lazy Scranton video] Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
Have a seat. Like everybody else.
But Ed truck can't because he is---
I can't get out of it!
No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
Come on, egghead. Let's do it.
The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...
I did not order a stripper.
Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers.
How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?
Good luck. One of a kind.
[in his office playing with a Dunder Mifflin Truck when it drops and the 'head' of the Truck comes off]
No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?
Yes.
Hey, do you need any help?
Feelin' hot, hot, hot! [playing conch shell] Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.
[on microphone] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?
Everybody? If... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...'
I'm not going to make this call.
I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.
Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
What are you wearing?
So let's see what we can find out from reading. [reads] Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
Okay.
There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?
Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
It was my understanding.
I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
Okay, so killing yourself. [laughs] I was just thinking about snot.
Plus perks, yes.
Oscar! Think abou- Think! [door slams]
Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
Right... Executive assistant.
Oh.
In training.
Yes, Phyl?
Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.
Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
Hello hello!
Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?
Na, Na-oh, Naa-es.
No. These s'mores are disgusting.
What?
Please don't do that.
Go to your room.
Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
Frame him?
So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
Hi.
They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level]
Well, it is time to call in a little favor. A buddy of mine runs this tourist attraction, actually it's big. It's probably one of the most popular in the state. So...
The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
Definitely.
Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.
We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
[flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
You think that's funny.
Um it is, Grotti.
This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone.
I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.
Play some games?
I don't get it. Do I stress you out?
Um, I'll... I have to think about it.
Yes?
No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.  But I just... just want to keep it within reason.
No. No. He's my nephew.
Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight.
Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]
Am I the princess?
You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
Thank you.
Okay.
Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?
Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
But you did still love him.
Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all.
No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
No, I will ex-squeeze you.
Hey, Buttercup.
Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I... [band starts playing]
That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
Really?
No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
Okay, how do you feel?
Alright, well, cool. [Michael walks by Jim] Still deciding?
Mmm-hmm.
Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
I will open the door.
Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip.
Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.
[Creed is using the toaster as a mirror, and touching up his hair with a Sharpie and a comb] The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them.  And old enough to know the difference between the two.  I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls.  But old enough to know better.  I'm at a perfect age.  I could die now.  But I won't, because I am young.
Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
That's hilarious.  What's her number?
I am going to give Toby...
Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
We are so rich.
I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. [hands him a thin black folder] Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
Thank you. You too.
See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
We're not-
What the hell is going on?
Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy...
But there's no downsizing, so just don't...
Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. [to band] Do you know, um, 'Goodbye Stranger'? Supertramp?
Entourage!
Yeah, I have fun.
I don't... okay, just listen.
Yeah, here we go. Ok.
Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees]
Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
Excellent! Way to go! Nice! [Michael and granddaughter Prince exchange high fives]
Will you?
Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.
Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!
No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.
Yes you will.
Good.
Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
That was fun.
[stutters] We'll have to talk--
Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this.
Mmmhmmm.
On the phone.
Uh, yeah, sure.
Okay.
You did uh... okay.
[annoyed] All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.
Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.
He is in an all-out sprint.
Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.
Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
Okay.
No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]
[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!
There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
A check for the kids, and for the team.
Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
Who else? Who else? Ryan?
Well.
Yeah.
I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it!
Uh, well I'm afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.
Guys, she's in there.
This is a little character I like to do [places a green turban with a yellow feather on his head], it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. [puts an envelope to his head] Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. [tears open envelope and pulls out card] 'Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.'  Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.
Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
[pizza guy flips him off] Okay.
Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.
Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...
Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something.
Never.  About what?  A little-- what are you talking--
Yes.
It could've died of natural causes. So...
Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
Shut -
Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh?
No, I'm team captain.
I'm going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
Luke is my nephew.
Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
Oh, yes. [mimicking smoking] Doobie-doobie doo.
Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
Let's cut it. [Dwight turns the music off]
Hello, Dwight.
[barely keeping his composure] 'Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!' [laughs]
Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
Ah, no. Don't worry about it.
I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.
Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.
To be continued!
OK...  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.
I will miss you the most Ryan.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Dwight, you're handsome.  You're a very handsome man, get in the car.
I'm texting about you, okay!?
Okay, some for, some against.
We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...
Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...
They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
[entering kitchen area] Oh, that smells good.
I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture]
[camera pans over, Michael is sitting in a chair] Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else? [points] Yep.
You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...
You know what?  I deserve a bump.
Glad you could all make it.
Um. Okay, um.
Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
Okay, we're trapped.  Everyone for himself.
I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!
That is not big picture.
I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
Da  na na na na!!
No reason.
Well, it's, it's-
This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange [points to Andy]
No, that's skeptical. Do sad.
Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
You're an ass. Shut it.
I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
[starts to speak, says nothing, walks away]
What about a rabies nurse?
Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?
Right, I'm gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh.  Bureaucracy and germs.
[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that says 'Good Morning'] Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.
And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
Mm-hmm.
Shut up!
Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
Yeah, I'm good. You good?
So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
I'm sorry, sorry.
What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
No. Humans with AIDS.
And fries!
Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust.
That's ironic.
I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all.
Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
Curly? Very good. Curly Joe DeRita.
Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
That was not scripted.
Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
Okay, well... all settled, then.
No, no, I can do this.
Ah, the old 'leave behind.' Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.
Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.
Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of 'Serenity by Jan' What do you think about that?
Is he alright?
It-- yep, recently.
The sales department smashed my sandwich.
Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
You're sure?
We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
OK, 1 Sikh, and...
Really?
No!
Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun. [gasps]  That's why I always start with a gun, because you can't top it, you just can't.
No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
Yeah?
You and Jim are close, huh?
Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, 'Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.' His words.
Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!
No, no. You're done.
Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
What?
No, no. [blues piano playing]
No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.
300 and one penny, 300 and one penny.
A murder, you say?  I do declare.
How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
No!  No!  Jim, Jim, don't, don't...
Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
Okay, well, we'll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office]
Okay.
No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.
You and me.
[on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
[sighing] Why don't you just leave? Okay?
You're not.
Andy.
Well, comedy's kinda my thing. Watch this, here's Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Right. [Continues with cod German] Me, me, me, me, me, me. Curly Joe Hitler. [laughs]
So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog...
After breakfast.
All right.
That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
What you don't know... Well, it can hurt you, but if you don't know it won't hurt you. Then, you can just be happy for a little while at least.
Really?
Because he wasn't following the rules.
Right. [sighs]
What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.
It is moving day.  I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um [Dwight puts his fingers to his head and makes a shooting noise] ssp... No, I did not kill her.  We were just at different places in our lives.  No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.  She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale.  Fresh outlook, and it's all good.
Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.
Okay.  What?  Um...
Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.
That's okay.
Gahh, I will pull this car over!
In case... in case of what?
Well, we are extremely sorry.
You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
It is a terrible year for love.
I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar]
So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay. [they kiss goodbye.] Goodbye.
Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad.
No!
I looked at the bag.
Cause he slept in the car a couple times.
A.J.
Yes
I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic. [Stanley stands to leave] See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
So that's the problem, is solved. What?
What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper' and get them to 'Show us the money!' Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. [some raise their hands] Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?
No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
So did you hear the news?
[on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
Thank you.
Nope. Nope. Not yet.
You think you would have done better without me? Really?
Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
Maybe I did. Maybe I  called him, I don't know.
You were a Jet?
That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]
OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
You guys...
[smiling] Okay, well we'll work on it.
All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. [cheering]
Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
I don't want to do that. [chanting continues] All right. [picks up phone and dials] She is going to freak out!
I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...
I'm
Why aren't they building it themselves?
Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
How much time do you think you'll need?
Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.
A what?
I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.
Later guys. [leaves the office]
Send me a picture.
Nah.
Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
Okay.
Not much, what's up with you?
Do a poem for Meredith's birthday or uh, limerick. Limerick. Um, [knock on  door] there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Come on in. Who had a big, smifflin.
Pretty disgusting.
You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend ---
Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Ok, feel better.
[talking over Jan] Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I'm gonna give myself a pat on the back.
Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup.
I don't.
Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
Why?
We will wait for the call and you will smile.  Let me try something, just while we're waiting.
Times have changed, Jim.
Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?
I would do the same for you.
We heard it.
No, no. No.
Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.
My whole life, I have known two things: I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.
Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
I can't tell you.
What's this?
Women in the workplace... yeah, translation 'I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.' Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!
Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define 'begin'. I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.
Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
Sits on a copier.
Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just... yeah.
I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
Well...
You bet.
[in reference to the team shirts] I'll take a shirt.
Well... That's my watch.
James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue]
[laughs] Try it on.
[carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst...
In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
Oh you don't, that's-
Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. [turns off tv]
[clapping] Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.
[knocking on door] Hmm?
Love it.
[stares at Jim silently, then walks away]
Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
Look, we want you back.
That's a dog.
[knock on door] Mmm-hmm.
Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?
Problem. Good.
Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.
It's like a mock execution.
Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.
Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It's bland.
That's a lot of zeroes.
Hmm.
Mmm.
I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
Thank you, Dana.
No no no, no, new suit, please.
Okay.
Been thinking about you.
Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!
I'm sorry.
Mmm... okay.
Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.
Who you dating?
Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.
Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
The aye's have it.
Well it can wait. It can wait.
Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
Oh yeah.
I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.
Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
All right, all right, I'm on a roll.
Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
[fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
No, please, please...
Alright [takes Jan's coat].
Who else knows?
I don't need a gun.
Charley horse!
Get lost.
You're right, you're right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok.
[singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...
Yeah!
No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
Like we're going to the science museum.
Does your stupid husband have it?
You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.
No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
Five, four, three.  'There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldn't be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me.  They're trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day.'
Exactly. What are you thinking?
Welcome.
How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money.
Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.
You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
She did it!
Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
Not now.
400 and one penny.
Packer. Pac-man.
We didn't get it.
I own a Chrysler.
You ready to do this?
I know. [sighs] Okay.  Alright.  [Pam goes to punch him again] Oh-- God!
So, how you been?
Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.
Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
Pam, it's Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
That was awesome. Thank you.
Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society.
I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.
There he is! Hello, hello!
I didn't hear you. [laughs]
Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
[laughing] Okay. I'm so nervous.
[laughs] Does anybody else know about this?
I'm not better than Josh.
[Outside of the restaurant, obviously sad] So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
No, I think it is-
Good. Good. Thank God.
Uh, hey... Creed?
Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.
I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
Because it's better. Because it's more special.
Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
They call it Scranton!
Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.
That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
When will she be ready?
That could not possibly be it.
Exactly.
Shut up.
Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
Im not a shark.
No, no.
All right.
There, there...
Ryan?
So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
Why is today a special day?
So I looked him in the eye and I said, 'Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead.' I said something like that.
I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.
Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
I'm right here.
Okay.
Mm. That's not gonna happen.
Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.
Hey Jan.
Yes.
Its not just a van.
Okay.
Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God...I better call.
If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We're like Animal House.
Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
Forty... I'm in my forties.
See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.
Hey, Toby.
That's not-
If everybody... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...'
Where the hell is that?
Yes, we did.
[entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?
What the hell was that?
OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
... and I feel free!
Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?
Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
What's going on? Anything here?
OK
This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
Yeah, so there you go.
Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?
You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
It's not scary.
Do I know a Carol Stills?
[sigh] Something with a 'K'.
Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
Really? What's going on?
I'm not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And...
Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]
I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?
And tell him the joke.
Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
Just bragging rights.
Oh.
Try 'profits'.  No! Try 'Michael Scott'.  'Michael' 'boss' and 'funny'. [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow!  [chuckles]  E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.  [reads e-mail]  'Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late.'  Well, Stanley's an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.
I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.
What?
Yes, you are.  And you know what you're going to have?
Look at him, he's laughing.
[laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
Really?
Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
All right.
[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
Or a trained seal. [laughter]
No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.
It was
This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--
Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!
Working on it.
I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
You gotta do something--
Ughh... Blech.
Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes]
That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.
Hmm...
What you mean uh hmmm... ?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
I heard a-
Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can't pay for your college.  But you don't have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. [students perk up] Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.
All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
Wait, what?
Okay. Okay.
I'll call you later.
Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.
No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.
Cow surfing. [spots a cow out the window] Okay, here we go, there's a cow.
Last gift. Kevin.
No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don't have a lot of time.  I'll get the pizza!
Oh... okay. [looks back at Andy and Oscar] Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap.  I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold.  I will don it... and oh! Look at that.  I can't see because I am in a-- [cart crashes into Michael's leg] GAH!
No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales.
Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down]
Pass.
No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]
Have a seat.
We're not.
Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! [Spanks himself]
When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls].  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that
I'm not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college.  Okay, all right.
Walk with me.
Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.
Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?
Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.
No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket]
[crashes into Jim and Pam's parked car] Oh, my god!
[quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]
Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder what's going on. [follows them]
See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, 'Man, I wish I got that.' I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.
Irie.
Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out.
Where were you this morning?
We're never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub]
I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
Today is about family.
Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
I came here hoping to meet somebody.  You know, as you do at weddings.  End up going to sleep by the vending machine.  It was loud, but it was warm.
Dwight, do you have the box?
Oh. Thank God.
After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level: Midnight.
Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
Okay.
Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah? [writes Huge Gut] Meredith?
Confidence, Dwight.
Well, okay.  Different management styles.
If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
All right.
Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell]
[from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
Good night. She's a good boss.
Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?
Oh, yeah...
Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
No.
Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
It...
Very inspirational. [laughter]
No, this is romantic.
It is, yes.
Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now.
Hey Dwight.
Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!
All right! Thank you!
Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley.
You are welcome.
And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.
Come on! Phyllis!
She's not playing the game.
This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
